<p><b><a id="Transcribers_notes"></a>Transcriber’s notes</b>:</p>

<p>In this transcription a black dotted underline indicates a hyperlink
to a page, illustration or footnote; hyperlinks are also marked by
aqua highlighting when the mouse pointer hovers over them. A red dashed
underline indicates the presence of a hidden comment that can be
revealed by hovering the mouse pointer over the underlined text. Page
numbers are shown in the right margin.</p>

<p>The text contains some uncommon characters that will not necessarily display
correctly with all viewing devices. If some of the characters look
abnormal, first ensure that the device’s character encoding is set to
Unicode (UTF-8). The default font might also need to be changed to
a Unicode font such as Arial Unicode MS, DejaVu, Segoe UI Symbol or
FreeSerif. Symbols representing male and female have been replaced by M and F in the
handheld version. Subscripted and superscripted characters do not always
display correctly on handheld devices.</p>

<p>The book contained innumerable typographical errors affecting
spelling, punctuation and formatting. Most spelling errors have
been corrected silently, but spelling variants that mainly reflect
contemporary spellings in the original quoted sources, have been
left unchanged. A <a href="#Spelling_inconsistencies">list of
the corrections and variations</a> can be seen at the end of the
transcription. Punctuation anomalies (errors, omissions, duplications)
have mostly been corrected silently, but missing apostrophes have
not been corrected because of uncertainty about intended meaning. A
few missing quotation marks have been inserted within curly brackets
{"} and missing words inserted by the transcriber, e.g. {sic} {and}
have also been enclosed within curly brackets to differentiate them
from the numerous words and phrases inserted by the authors. Redundant duplicated
words have been deleted. Astute readers will probably note persisting
inconsistencies involving italics, fonts, hyphenation, ellipses,
accents, and ligatures (ae/æ, oe/œ) that have been left unchanged
because they have no impact on interpretation of the text. The Table
of Contents does not correspond accurately with headings used in the
text.</p>

<p> Footnotes are located at the end of the book and are hyperlinked
in the text. In most cases a return hyperlink will take the reader
back to the appropriate place in the text, except for those footnotes
that are cross-referenced multiple times. In these cases the return
hyperlink will take the reader back to the location where the
footnote was <i>first</i> referenced – it is better to make use of the
browser's back-arrow to return to the correct location. An error in
footnote numbering was corrected silently, and a missing footnote
[120] was inserted after being identified in the original source.</p>

<p>Several large tables have been compressed in size to enable viewing
on small screens and when necessary a key has been added to identify the
column headings.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUME 2</h2>


<p>There were nine editions of the first volume of The Propaganda for
Reform in Proprietary Medicines. The ninth edition contained the
most important reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and
of the Chemical Laboratory. It contained also those articles from
<i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (up to, and including,
1916) which dealt with the problems of proprietaryship in medicine and
the furtherance of rational drug therapy.</p>

<p>The present volume contains similar material covering the period
from January, 1917, to April, 1922, inclusive. Like Volume 1, this
volume is divided into four parts:</p>

<p>Part I. <span class="smcap">The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</span>: This section
presents the principles and rules which govern the Council in the
examination of medicaments, together with articles and reports bearing
on the work of the Council, and the most important reports of the
Council from 1917 to April, 1922, inclusive.</p>

<p>Part II. <span class="smcap">The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory</span>: This section,
besides presenting the aims and objects of the Association’s Chemical
Laboratory, also outlines some of the Laboratory’s work which is of
particular interest to physicians.</p>

<p>Part III. <span class="smcap">Contributions from the Journal</span>: Proprietary
Products: This part contains articles on proprietary medicinal preparations
and the methods by which they are exploited, which have appeared
in <i>The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i></p>

<p>Part IV. <span class="smcap">Contributions from The Journal: Miscellany</span>: In
this section are articles dealing with matters of interest to the medical
profession but not coming strictly under the classification of proprietary
medicinal preparations.</p>

<p>A comparison of the material that has appeared in Volume 1 of
The Propaganda for Reform with that which appears in this volume
will reveal the changing conditions in the proprietary medicine field.
Many of the reports in the first volume brought out the fact that
medicinal preparations were at that time foisted on the profession with<span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span>
false claims of composition; reports of this character are less conspicuous
in the present volume. Many of the reports in Volume 2
deal with unwarranted therapeutic claims, especially those advanced
for animal organ preparations, serums, vaccines, preparations for
intravenous medication, etc. The present volume will also be found of
interest in its portrayal of the changed conditions in the proprietary
medicine business brought about by the World War.</p>

<p>Special attention is directed to the index in this volume. It is, in
effect, a bibliography, including references not only to articles in this
book but also (1) to articles which appeared in Volume 1; (2) to
articles on the same general subject in <i>The Journal of the American
Medical Association</i>, and (3) to the articles appearing in the annual
reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory, but not reprinted in either volume of the Propaganda
for Reform in Proprietary Medicines.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUME 1: NINTH EDITION</h2>

<hr class="r16" />

<p>From time to time <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
has published the reports of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry and the Chemical Laboratory, as well as other matter on
proprietary medicines. Repeated requests for some of the matter have
led to the compilation of “The Propaganda for Reform in Proprietary
Medicines,” which, in the present volume, attains its ninth edition.</p>

<p>The seventh, eighth and ninth editions have been compiled on
slightly different principles from their predecessors. The therapeutic
reform work of <i>The Journal</i> and of the Association’s Chemical
Laboratory was at first confined almost entirely to the criticism and
analysis of the so-called ethical proprietaries. This was right; the
medical profession owed it to the public to combat the nostrum evil
within its own ranks.</p>

<p>As the more flagrant evils of the “ethical proprietary” question
were mitigated, the Association has turned the light on the more widespread
and dangerous “patent medicine” evil. The articles devoted to
“patent medicines” or quackery being naturally of greater interest to
the general public than to the medical profession, the number of
inquiries from laymen regarding various quacks and nostrums has
steadily increased. It has been thought best, therefore, to publish
separately all of the matter from <i>The Journal</i> relative to quackery
and to those nostrums exploited only or chiefly to the public, and to
include in the Propaganda for Reform practically none of the matter
that is of direct interest primarily to laymen. In one or two instances
in which the subjects were of equal interest to the profession and to
the public, matter that has already appeared in “Nostrums and Quackery”
is also given here; but as a general rule the contents of the ninth
edition of “The Propaganda for Reform” are of strictly professional
interest. Those physicians who are desirous of obtaining in convenient
form the matter dealing with “patent medicines” should order the book
“Nostrums and Quackery” or the various pamphlets on the same subjects
<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>that have been issued since “Nostrums and Quackery” came from
the press.</p>

<p>The ninth edition of “Propaganda for Reform” contains a number
of new articles, greatly increasing the size of the book. It also contains
one novel feature which greatly enhances its value. The index includes
references not only to articles in the book, but also to matter on proprietaries
not accepted by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
which appeared in <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
and elsewhere. This index makes of this edition of “Propaganda
for Reform” a very full work of reference on proprietaries which
are undeserving of recognition. It should be understood, however, that
not all articles indexed are condemned; some are merely discussed and
compared.</p>

<h2>RESOLUTION ENDORSING THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL
ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY</h2>

<hr class="r16" />

<h4>Presented at the San Francisco Session and Signed by All the Members
of the House of Delegates in Attendance</h4>


<div class="box">
<p><i>Resolved</i>, We, Members of the House of Delegates of the
American Medical Association, believe that every effort must
be made to do away with the evils which result from the
exploitation of the sick for the sake of gain. Earnestly
believing that the continued toleration of secret, semisecret,
unscientific or untruthfully advertised proprietary medicines
is an evil that is inimical to medical progress and to the best
interest of the public, we declare ourselves in sympathy with,
endorse and by our best efforts will further, the work which
has been, and is being, done by the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry of the American Medical Association in the
attempt to eliminate this evil.</p></div>

<h3>THE COUNCIL ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY</h3>


<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry was established by the
American Medical Association primarily for the purpose of gathering
and disseminating such information as would protect the medical profession&mdash;and
thus the public&mdash;in the prescribing of proprietary medicinal
articles.</p>

<p>The Council consists of sixteen members, fifteen appointed for a
term of five years without pay, and the sixteenth, a secretary, who is
also the director of the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical
Association (see <a href="#PART_II">Part II</a>).</p>

<p>At its first meeting in 1905, the Council began examining the
proprietary and nonofficial medicinal preparations offered to physicians
of the United States, and authorized the publication of a book (New
and Non­official Remedies) containing descriptions of those preparations
which were deemed worthy of the consideration of physicians. It also
issued reports (Reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry) to
the medical profession on those preparations which were not eligible.
The Council adopted a set of rules by which to measure the eligibility of
each preparation for admission to New and Non­official Remedies. These
rules were designed primarily to protect the public&mdash;through the medical
profession&mdash;against fraud, undesirable secrecy and objectionable
advertising in connection with proprietary medicinal articles. The
rules originally adopted have been subjected to revision from time to
time to meet changing conditions. For the information of those who
wish to familiarize themselves with the work of the Council the
rules which are now in force (1921) follow this introduction. A
summary is also to be found in the article, “The Work of the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry, Present and Future,” page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1906, the Council has issued New and Non­official Remedies
annually. In each issue are listed and described the articles that stand
accepted on January 1 of the year of publication. The book describes
proprietary medicinal articles on the American market that are found
eligible under the rules, and also such nonproprietary, nonofficial articles
as give promise of therapeutic usefulness, listing the acceptable brands.
Articles of a similar character are grouped together, and each group is
preceded by a general discussion for the purpose of comparison.</p>

<p>Since 1908, the Council has also issued an annual volume, “Reports
of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,” which contains
reports on proprietary medicines that were found inadmissible to
New and Non­official Remedies. The reports issued prior to 1916&mdash;and
deemed of sufficient interest to physicians&mdash;were reprinted in the
Propaganda for Reform in Proprietary Medicines, ninth edition (1916).
The more important reports issued from 1916 to 1921, inclusive, are
in this volume.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span></p>
<p>While it is the chief function of the Council to investigate and
report on proprietary medicinal preparations, its work has broadened
so that the Council’s work may now be characterized as a propaganda
for the rational use of drugs. Thus, its Committee on Therapeutic
Research encourages the investigation of questions concerning the
actions of drugs. These investigations are brought together in the
“Annual Reports of the Therapeutic Research Committee.” The Council
also has a committee on medical teaching which has issued the publication
“Useful Drugs,” a concise, but thorough and up-to-date, discussion
of the more important drugs. In addition, the Council
appointed a committee to prepare an “Epitome of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
and National Formulary,” in which are presented those portions
of the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary that
are of interest to physicians and in which is given a concise statement
of the therapeutic usefulness of such drugs and preparations.</p>

<h3>OFFICIAL RULES OF THE COUNCIL ON PHARMACY
AND CHEMISTRY</h3>

<p class="tac">[May 1, 1921]</p>


<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The following rules have been adopted by the Council primarily with the
object of protecting the medical profession and the public against fraud, undesirable
secrecy and objectionable advertising in connection with proprietary
medicinal articles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New and Non­official Remedies.</span>&mdash;The book New and Non­official Remedies
contains a description of proprietary articles which have been accepted as conforming
to the rules of the Council; and of such simple nonproprietary and
nonofficial substances as seem of sufficient importance to warrant their inclusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mixtures.</span>&mdash;For admission to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., proprietary pharmaceutical mixtures
must comply with the rules; and, to determine such compliance, they will be
investigated by the Council. The Council, however, endorses the principle that
prescriptions should be written on the basis of the therapeutic effects of the
individual ingredients. For this reason, it includes in this book only those mixtures
that present some real advantage. There is also an appendix in which
are included those proprietary articles which, so far as known to the Council,
comply with the rules, but which do not possess sufficient originality to be
admitted to the body of the book.</p>


<h4>Rules Governing the Admission of Proprietary Articles to the Book
New and Non­official Remedies</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Definition of Proprietary Articles.</span>&mdash;The term “proprietary article,” in this
place, shall mean any chemical, drug or similar preparation used in the treatment
of diseases, if such article is protected against free competition, as to
name, product, composition or process of manufacture, by secrecy, patent,
copyright, or by any other means.</p>

<p><i>Rule 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Composition.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted for inclusion in the
book New and Non­official Remedies, or retained therein, unless its composition
be furnished to the Council for publication. For simple substances, the
<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>scientific name and the chemical formula, rational or structural, if known,
should be supplied. For mixtures, the amount of each active medicinal ingredient
in a given quantity of the article must be stated. The general composition
of the vehicle, its alcoholic percentage, and the identity of the preservatives
must be furnished.</p>

<p><i>Rule 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Identification.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted or retained unless suitable
tests for determining its composition are furnished to the Council. In the
case of chemical compounds, these shall consist of tests for identity and purity.
In the case of mixtures, description of methods for determining the amount
and active strength of the potent ingredients shall be furnished, if practicable.</p>

<p><i>Rule 3.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Direct Advertising.</span>&mdash;No article that is advertised to the public
will be accepted or retained; but this rule shall not apply to: (<i>a</i>) disinfectants,
germicides and antiseptics, provided the advertising is limited to conservative
recommendations for their use as prophylactic applications to superficial
cuts and abrasions of the skin and to the mucous surfaces of the
mouth, pharynx and nose (but not to those of the eye, and the gastro-intestinal
and genito-urinary tracts) and provided they are not advertised as curative
agents (see <a href="#Explanation_of_Rule_3">comments to Rule 3</a>); and (<i>b</i>) nonmedicinal food preparations,
except when advertised in an objectionable manner.</p>

<p><i>Rule 4.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Indirect Advertising.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted or retained if
the label, package or circular accompanying the package contains the names
of diseases in the treatment of which the article is said to be indicated. The
therapeutic indications and properties may be stated, provided such statements
do not suggest self-medication. Dosage may be indicated. (This rule shall
not apply to remedies with which self-medication is altogether improbable, to
vaccines and antitoxins or to directions for administering or applying remedies
when similar immediate, heroic treatment is indicated.)</p>

<p><i>Rule 5.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">False Claims as to Origin.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted or retained
concerning which the manufacturer or his agents make false or misleading
statements as to source, raw material from which made, or method of collection
or preparation.</p>

<p><i>Rule 6.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Unwarranted Therapeutic Claims.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted or
retained concerning which the manufacturer or his agents make unwarranted,
exaggerated or misleading statements as to the therapeutic value.</p>

<p><i>Rule 7.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Poisonous Substances.</span>&mdash;The principal label on an article containing
“poisonous” or “potent” substances must state plainly the amount of each of
such ingredients in a given quantity of the product.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule 8.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Objectionable Names.</span>&mdash;Proprietary names for medicinal articles
will be recognized only when the Council shall deem the use of such exclusive
names to be in the interest of public welfare. Names which are misleading
or which suggest diseases, pathologic conditions or therapeutic indications
will not be recognized (the provision against thera­peutically suggestive names
does not apply to serums, vaccines and antitoxins, or to foods). In the case of
pharmaceutical preparations or mixtures, the name must be so framed as to
indicate the most potent ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Rule 9.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Patented Products and Protected Names.</span>&mdash;If the article is patented&mdash;either
process or product, or both&mdash;the number of such patent or patents
must be furnished to the Council. Furthermore, if the name of an article is
registered, or the label copyrighted, the registration (trademark) number and
a copy of the protected label should be furnished the Council. In case of
registration in foreign countries, the name under which the article is registered
should be supplied.</p>

<p><i>Rule 10.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Unscientific and Useless Articles.</span>&mdash;No article will be accepted
or retained which, because of its unscientific composition, is useless or inimical
to the best interests of the public or of the medical profession.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>

<h4>Explanatory Comments on the Rules</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span>&mdash;The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry was established in
February, 1905, by the American Medical Association, primarily for the purpose
of gathering and disseminating such information as will protect the medical
profession in the prescribing of proprietary medicinal articles. In pursuance
of this object, the Council examines the articles on the market as to their compliance
with definite rules designed to prevent fraud, undesirable secrecy and
the abuses which arise from advertising directly or indirectly to the laity.
Such articles as appear to conform to the rules are accepted; and their essential
features are described in the annual publication of the Council, New and
Non­official Remedies, if they come within the scope of this book. These
descriptions are based in part on investigations made by, or under, the direction
of the Council, but in part also on evidence or information supplied by the
manufacturer or his agents. Such interested statements are examined critically,
and are admitted only if they appear to be in conformity with the
evidence. It is, however, manifestly impossible for the Council to investigate
the composition of every complex pharmaceutical mixture, or to check
thoroughly every therapeutic claim; it can give only an unbiased judgment on
the available evidence. Criticisms and corrections of the descriptions which
may aid in the revision of the matter will be appreciated. The Council judges
an article entirely by the facts in evidence at the time of its admission.
Previous noncompliance with the rules (short of <i>intentional</i> fraud) does not
prevent the favorable consideration of an article which is in accord with
existing rules. Infringements of the rules after acceptance of an article for
New and Non­official Remedies, or the discovery that the Council’s information
was incorrect, will cause the acceptance to be reconsidered. An article is
accepted for New and Non­official Remedies, and will continue to be included
in the book, with the understanding that serious violations of the rules, after
acceptance, will be followed by the omission of the article and publication of
the reasons for such omission. The Council desires physicians to understand
that the admission of an article does not imply a recommendation. Acceptance
simply means that no conflict with the rules has been found by the Council.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duration of Acceptance.</span>&mdash;Unless an agreement to the contrary is made at
the time of acceptance, articles admitted to New and Non­official Remedies will
be retained for a period of three years, provided that during that period they
comply with the rules and regulations which were in force at the time of their
acceptance. At the end of this period all articles will be carefully reexamined
for compliance with existing rules. Particular weight will be given to the question
as to whether recent evidence has substantiated claims as to the therapeutic
value of any preparation, this evidence to consist partly of recent statements
in the literature and partly of the general esteem in which the preparation is
held by clinical consultants of the Council. The reacceptance of articles after
such reexamination shall be for three years unless a shorter period is specified.
Any amendments to the rules, by specific requirements or by interpretation,
which may be made after the acceptance of an article, shall not apply to such
article until the period of acceptance has elapsed. At the end of this period
the article, if it is not eligible under the amended rules, will be omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Scope of New and Non­official Remedies and Appendix.</span>&mdash;To aid physicians
and manufacturers in deciding what articles come within the scope of
this book, or, in other words, to enable physicians to recognize whether an
article which is not described in New and Non­official Remedies has been
omitted because it does not need admission or because it has been rejected, the
Council furnishes the following more detailed definitions:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Official Articles.</span>&mdash;<i>Articles official in the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. or N.&nbsp;F. do not require
consideration by the Council if they are marketed under the official name and
if no unestablished therapeutic claims are made for them.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>
<p>These do not require consideration by the Council, since standards for them
are provided in these books, and enforced under the provisions of the federal
Food and Drugs Act, except that they may be mentioned for information. Consideration
by the Council becomes necessary if a U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. or N.&nbsp;F. product is
offered for sale under a name other than that, or the synonyms, under which
the product is described in one of these books of standards, or if the proprietors
or their agents advance claims that the product possesses therapeutic properties
other than those commonly accredited to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Modifications of U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. and N.&nbsp;F. Products.</span>&mdash;A pharmacopeial or National
Formulary product which is marketed under the official title or synonym, but
with well-founded claims that its purity, permanence, palatability or other
physical properties excel the official standard, may, if no extraordinary therapeutic
properties are asserted, be considered as an official article and held not
to be within the scope of New and Non­official Remedies. When such products
are marketed under the claim that they possess therapeutic properties other
than those commonly accredited to the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. or N.&nbsp;F. products of which
they are modifications, they shall be subject to the consideration of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Specifically Exempted Preparations.</span>&mdash;Foods, in general, unless marketed
with the claim that they possess therapeutic properties shall not, at the present
time, be considered by the Council. Mechanical appliances, at the present time,
shall not be considered by the Council. Mineral waters (natural), at the present
time, shall not be considered by the Council. With these exceptions, products
which in the judgment of the Council are manufactured and marketed in conformity
to the principles underlying the rules of the Council may be accepted
for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. Products which are manufactured and marketed in a manner
which does not conform to the principles underlying the rules of the Council
shall not be accepted for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. The burden of proof in establishing claims
for therapeutic properties of products considered by the Council shall lie with
the proprietor or, when a foreign made product, with the agent who markets
the product in the United States. To avoid confusion with nonofficial substances
marketed under similar names, the Council recommends that official
substances be prescribed by their official titles, followed by the abbreviation
“U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.” or “N.&nbsp;F.”; thus: Tinctura Nucis Vomicae, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.; Elixir
Gentianae, N.&nbsp;F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Substances Described in New and Non­official Remedies.</span>&mdash;In the body of
the book will be described simple proprietary substances and their preparations;
proprietary mixtures if they have originality or other important qualities which,
in the judgment of the Council, entitle them to such place, and important,
nonproprietary, unofficial articles. The Council recommends that when the
latter are prescribed, they be indicated by the abbreviation, “N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.,” thus
insuring to the prescriber the quality of these articles laid down in the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proprietary Mixtures.</span>&mdash;A mixture will be considered as proprietary, and
therefore requiring consideration by the Council for admission to the book
or appendix, if it contains any proprietary article; if it is marketed under a
name which is in any way protected, or if its manufacturer claims for it
any unusual therapeutic qualities. Proprietary mixtures which are marketed
in conformity with the rules are listed in the appendix of the book under the
names of the respective manufacturers. Such proprietary mixtures are not
admitted to the body of the book, save in the exceptional cases cited in the
preceding paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nonproprietary Mixtures of Official Substances.</span>&mdash;Since the ingredients of
such mixtures do not require consideration by the Council, and since the
mixtures are not open to the proprietary abuses which call for the work of
the Council, it is not necessary that they should be investigated by the Council.
The physician must judge whether such mixtures should be directed to be
prepared by the pharmacist, or whether he is justified in ordering a ready-made
<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>preparation. If he decides to use a ready-made, nonproprietary preparation,
he must judge for himself whether it is marketed in accordance with the rules.
It should, however, be remembered that the application of a trade name to any
substance makes it proprietary.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 1: Composition</h4>

<p><i>Secrecy Objectionable.</i>&mdash;It is not only the right but also the duty of the
physician to know the essential composition of what he prescribes; the Council
cannot compromise on this proposition.</p>

<p><i>Vehicles and Preservatives.</i>&mdash;In the case of mixtures, not only the potent
ingredient, but also the general character of the vehicle, the presence of alcohol,
and the identity of preservatives, or of any other substance, whether added
or present as an impurity, must be stated if these can under any circumstances
affect the therapeutic action of the article. This, as a rule, does not mean the
publication of trade secrets, such as flavors or the details of the working
formula.</p>

<p><i>Trade Secrets.</i>&mdash;Furthermore, trade secrets will not be received as confidential
by the Council, since it accepts information only with the distinct
understanding that this may be freely published, at its discretion.</p>

<p><i>Inspection of Factories.</i>&mdash;The Council does not accept invitations to inspect
factories; its concern is with the finished products.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Council requires that the information be complete
and accurate as to medicinal ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Unofficial Constituents.</i>&mdash;Unofficial constituents of proprietary mixtures must
be presented by the manufacturer in the regular way and must be acted on by
the Council before the preparations containing them can be accepted.</p>

<p><i>Fraud.</i>&mdash;When it appears that a manufacturer has made a <i>deliberately</i> false
statement concerning a product, he is asked to furnish an explanation; and
if this is not satisfactory, the product will not be accepted, even if the false
statement is subsequently corrected or omitted.</p>

<p><i>Testimonials.</i>&mdash;The foregoing paragraph applies not only to statements made
to the Council, but also to statements furnished to physicians by the manufacturer
or his agents, even when these statements are in the guise of testimonials.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 2: Identification</h4>

<p>In order to avoid errors in the case of chemical compounds, and to guard
against adulterations, lack of potency or strength, and the mistaking of one
chemical for another, it is necessary to have at hand suitable tests.</p>

<p><i>Tests, etc.</i>&mdash;If these facts have appeared in the literature, or in standard
textbooks, reference to them will be sufficient; but with new chemicals, especially
synthetics, the manufacturer or his representatives will be required to
supply such tests for publication, as will assure an intelligent opinion of these
products.</p>

<p><i>Physiologic Standard­ization.</i>&mdash;In cases in which chemical methods of identification
are unknown or unreliable, physiologic standard­ization should be
employed. The Council considers the phrase “physiologically standardized” or
“assayed” as misleading unless the standard and method are published in
sufficient detail to permit of their control by independent investigators. It is
evident that when no standard is published, it is impossible to know whether
the quality is high or low, and the conscientious manufacturer who sets for
himself a high standard is placed on a level with the dishonest or careless
one who adopts a low standard. Again, if the process of standard­ization is
not published, it is impossible to learn, without actual trial, the relative value
of one preparation as compared with that of another manufacturer, or to confirm
<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>or disprove the statements of the manufacturer as to the quality of his
product.</p>

<p><i>Standard­ization of Disinfectants and Germicides.</i>&mdash;No disinfectant or germicide
of the phenol type will be accepted for New and Non­official Remedies
whose phenol coefficient, determined according to the method of the Hygienic
Laboratory, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S., is not stated on the label of the preparation.</p>


<h4><a id="Explanation_of_Rule_3"></a>Explanation of Rule 3: Direct Advertising</h4>

<p><i>Lay Advertising.</i>&mdash;The impossibility of controlling the irresponsible claims
which are usually made in advertisements to the public, the well-known dangers
of suggesting by descriptions of symptoms to the minds of the people that they
are suffering from the many diseases described, the dangers of the unconscious
and innocent formation of a drug habit, and the evils of harmful self-medication,
including the dangers of the spread of many infectious and
contagious diseases when hidden from the physician, and similar well-known
considerations, are the reasons for discouraging, in the interest, and for the
safety, of the public, this reprehensible form of exploitation. Advertising in
medical journals, etc., distributed solely to physicians, does not come within
the scope of this rule.</p>

<p><i>Exceptions.</i>&mdash;In the case of subjects on which the public should be instructed,
as the use of disinfectants, germicides, antiseptics and foods, advertisements
to the public, if not in objectionable forms, are considered admissible. In no
case shall such advertisements include recommendations for use as curative
agents, nor shall the names of any diseases be mentioned in exploitation. If
the preparation is sufficiently toxic to require caution in its use to prevent
poisoning, this fact shall be stated on the label. On account of the deplorable
results which would follow any abuse of this privilege, the conscientious
cooperation of manufacturers and their agents in adhering strictly to the
limitations laid down is asked; and for the same reason the acceptance of
an article which is so advertised as to infringe on these limitations in any
essential way (as by naming diseases or by making false and exaggerated
claims) shall be summarily rescinded, and the reasons for such action may be
published without notice to manufacturer or agent. A disinfectant, germicide
or antiseptic will be accepted for description in New and Non­official Remedies,
and an article of this class which has already been accepted will continue to
be included in New and Non­official Remedies only on the explicit understanding
by the manufacturer and agent that such infringements of the rule
will be followed by deletion of the article and by publication of the facts as
described.</p>

<p><i>Foods.</i>&mdash;We may divide the foods into three groups. The first group contains
the ordinary foods, including the well-known breakfast foods. These do
not come under the supervision of the Council in any way. The second group
includes a large and important class of manufactured products, such as invalid
and infant foods, which in a sense stand between the first and third groups.
The public has the same interest in these foods that the physician has, and
usually is supplied with full information concerning them. While the primary
recommendation of these articles should naturally come from the physician, it
cannot be expected that their continued use should depend on repeated prescriptions.
Information concerning this group of foods would come naturally and
properly from a physician, and the collection and dissemination of this information
may very properly be included in the work of this Council. As the products
in this class are used extensively, it is not proper to limit their advertising to
medical journals, but the advertising should be permitted in the lay press so
long as it is conducted in a manner compatible with the rules of the Council. The
third group includes medicinal foods proper, such as predigested foods. These
have a relatively low food value and are characterized by a high alcohol or
<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>preservative content. They frequently contain strictly medicinal substances,
or food substances for which distinct therapeutic properties are claimed. These
products should be used only on the advice of the physician, and the advertisements
should be restricted as in the case of ordinary medicines.</p>

<p><i>Advertisements in Foreign Countries.</i>&mdash;The Council deals primarily, in the
interest of the public and of the medical profession, with articles proposed for
admission to New and Non­official Remedies, and, in determining the status of
any article, must take into consideration any statements made regarding it
or any method of advertising it employed by the manufacturer or his authorized
agents or representatives, whether in this country or abroad. The Council will
not regard as within its scope, however, questions concerning the marketing
of articles (except the matter of direct advertising to the laity and unwarranted
claims or mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions) in any country which has a public body corresponding
to this Council.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 4: Indirect Advertising</h4>

<p><i>Matter Distributed Solely to Physicians.</i>&mdash;It should be remembered that the
sole intent of this rule is to protect the physician, so that in prescribing a
proprietary medicine he shall not unconsciously advertise proprietary preparations.
The rule imposes no restriction on the legitimate methods of bringing
a remedy to the attention of the profession, such as advertising in medical
journals, circulars and other printed matter distributed solely to physicians.
The rule applies only to the package as it may reach the patient.</p>

<p><i>Naming Diseases on Labels.</i>&mdash;The naming of diseases on the label or package
is not necessary, as is shown by the very large number of proprietary
products which have been successfully introduced without resorting to this
expedient. This method of popularizing a proprietary remedy with the laity
is most objectionable, and should not be tolerated in any form. In general,
therapeutic indications should be omitted from the label and package. The
Council will not insist on this point, however, when such indications are so
given as not to promote self-medication, particularly in diseases which require
expert diagnosis and supervision. It will be considered an infringement of
the rule if an article be marketed in bottles which have the name of the article
blown into the glass, or if otherwise the name or initials or other distinctive
mark of the article is permanently stamped on the container, on the article
itself, or is on the stoppers or seals. Articles which are marketed in any of
these ways are not accepted for New and Non­official Remedies. Readily
removable labels are not objectionable, nor is the permanent affixing of the
firm’s initials or name to the trade package if such initials or name is not
suggestive of the article. The Council does not countenance the use of an
accepted article for advertising other articles which have not been accepted
by the Council.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 5: False Claims as to Origin</h4>

<p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;No false or misleading statement in regard to an article can be
permitted concerning the source of material from which it is made, or the
persons by whom it is made. Some glaring frauds of this nature have been
perpetrated in the past, and this rule is intended to prevent such imposition.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 6: Unwarranted Therapeutic Claims</h4>

<p><i>Therapeutic Questions.</i>&mdash;This rule insists that the claims of manufacturers
or agents concerning the therapeutic properties of their products must be
compatible with demonstrable facts. Manufacturers will be held responsible
for all statements made or quoted in their advertising “literature” regarding
their products. Recognizing the existence of honest differences of opinion
on many therapeutic questions, the Council desires to be liberal in the application
<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>of this rule. It is natural that a manufacturer should be partial toward
his own product, and a moderate degree of emphasis in advertising may not
be objectionable. The Council, however, will not admit claims which are
neither in harmony with already accepted facts nor supported by acceptable
evidence. In doubtful cases the Council considers these questions with the
advice and cooperation of its staff of clinical consultants.</p>

<p><i>Clinical Evidence.</i>&mdash;To be acceptable, the clinical evidence must offer
objective data with such citation of authority as will enable the Council to
confirm the facts and establish the scientific value of the conclusions drawn.
Clinical data are worthless when the author is not cited. The facts on which
claims with regard to the value of a remedy are based must have been rendered
accessible for investigation and confirmation by disinterested observers, either
through publication or through the records of a hospital or other institution.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 7: Poisonous Substances</h4>

<p><i>Poisons.</i>&mdash;For the information of the pharmacist or dispenser, and to enable
him to safeguard the interests of the patient and the physician, all articles
containing such potent agents as the poisonous alkaloids and other organic
substances and the salts of some of the metals should have the exact amount
of these ingredients which is contained in the average adult dose stated on
the label.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 8: Objectionable Names</h4>

<p><i>“Coined” Names.</i>&mdash;Many of the abuses connected with proprietary medicines
arise from “coined” proprietary trade names. Such names will not be recognized
by the Council unless in particular instances the Council shall deem their
use to be in the interest of public welfare. In every such exception the burden
of proof, both for establishing and for continuing the exception, lies with those
who market the product.</p>

<p><i>Proprietary (“Trade”) Names When Permitted.</i>&mdash;In consideration of the
benefits which may come from the discovery of a therapeutic agent, the Council
concedes to the person or firm which, by right of discovery, controls such a
product the right to name it. The Council will offer no opposition to an arbitrary
name for such a new product, provided it is not misleading, thera­peutically
suggestive, or otherwise subversive of scientific pharmacy and therapeutics.
If the discovery that a previously known substance has therapeutic value is
deemed of sufficient importance, the Council may recognize a name for such a
substance if the name is applied by the person who makes the discovery; or,
with the consent of the discoverer or in the absence of any protest on his
part, the Council may recognize a name applied by the firm which first makes
such a product available to physicians. In the interest of rational drug therapy,
the Council recommends that trade names be coined so as to indicate the potent
element or constituent.</p>

<p><i>Scientific Names.</i>&mdash;When the proprietary or trade name for an article is
considered insufficiently descriptive of its chemical composition or pharmaceutical
character, the Council may require as a condition for the acceptance
of such articles that a descriptive scientific name satisfactory to the Council
appear on the labels, circulars and advertisements for such an article. For all
definite chemical substances it is required that the scientific name be given
prominence on the labels, in circulars and advertisements.</p>

<p><i>Proprietary Names for Unoriginal Articles.</i>&mdash;Proprietary names will not be
recognized for articles which are included in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia or
National Formulary or for unessential modifications of such articles. Neither
will proprietary names be recognized for substances or mixtures which are
described in medical or pharmaceutical publications. In the marketing of
<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>unoriginal articles, the legitimate interests of the producer are fully served
by identifying such products by appending the name or initials of the manufacturer
or agent, or by the use of a general brand mark. No objection will
be made by the Council to the use of such brand marks, provided that in no
case shall such mark be used as a designation for an individual article.</p>

<p>For any product which, by reason of the absence or lapse of patent rights
or for other reasons, is open to manufacture by more than one firm, the Council
reserves the right to select a common name and to provide standards of identity,
purity and strength, and then will accept such article only if it is marketed
under the title adopted as the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. name or the name under which
such article was introduced (to which may be appended the firm’s identifying
mark).</p>

<p><i>N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. to U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.</i>&mdash;When an article which has been accepted for New
and Non­official Remedies is admitted to the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia or National
Formulary, it will be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies one year
after such standard­ization if the name of such article is used in these standards
either as the main title for the product or as a synonym. If the name under
which the article is described in New and Non­official Remedies is not used in
these books of standards, the proprietary preparation will be retained provided
the official name is given prominence on the labels and in the circulars and
advertisements of such article. When the Council adopts a common name for
an article that has been admitted under another name, it will be continued
under the older name only on condition that the Council name be given
prominence on the label and in the circulars and advertisements for such article.</p>

<p><i>Pharmaceutical Preparations and Mixtures.</i>&mdash;These, with rare exceptions,
are not original in composition and there is seldom any reason why they
should be endowed with arbitrary names. On the contrary, it is important that
the prescriber should be reminded constantly of their potent ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Thera­peutically Suggestive Names.</i>&mdash;Articles bearing thera­peutically suggestive
names will not be accepted for New and Non­official Remedies, first,
because they are likely to lead physicians into prescribing names instead of
remedies, and second, because they tend to encourage unwarranted self-medication
by the laity. Even if the name is at first apparently meaningless
to the public, its meaning will soon be understood because patients soon learn
the technical names applied to their diseases and symptoms. The prohibition
against thera­peutically suggestive names is not applied to serums, vaccines
and antitoxins, because the accepted nomenclature of the specific organisms
used in their preparation makes this unavoidable and because self-medication
with them is improbable.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 9: Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, Etc.</h4>

<p><i>Protection.</i>&mdash;This information is important as a means of determining the
legal status of medicinal articles and as an aid to their ready recognition in
current publications.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Rule 10: Unscientific and Useless Articles</h4>

<p><i>Unscientific Compounds.</i>&mdash;The use of articles which are unessential modifications
of official or established nonproprietary articles is unscientific and
serves no useful purpose. The Council will not accept products which are
scientifically unsound and which, therefore, must be considered useless or
inimical to the best interest of the medical profession and the public. This
class includes compounds or mixtures containing an excessive number of
active ingredients; those compounds or mixtures the components of which are
of no probable assistance to one another, and those articles which are of no
therapeutic value.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Unessential Modifications of Official Substances.</i>&mdash;The subterfuge of obtaining
proprietary rights over an official or established nonproprietary product, by
introducing unessential modifications, also tends to confusion and abuses, and
such articles will not be admitted by the Council. Essential and important
modifications, however, will receive recognition. (The Council interprets the
term “established nonproprietary product” as applying to a preparation of any
formula which has been published through any recognized or reasonably
accessible channel of publication, prior to its appropriation or modification by
a manufacturer.) Duplicates of biologic products accepted under the name of
the manufacturers will not be accepted under the names of the distributors.</p>

<h3>THE COUNCIL ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY,
PRESENT AND FUTURE&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h3>

<p class="author">W. A. Puckner, Phar.D.</p>

<p class="tac">Secretary, Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</p>


<p>The World War marked an epoch in the existence of the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry, as it did in all human endeavors. The information
and experience which had been accumulated by the Council during its thirteen
years’ existence was drawn on by our government, directly or indirectly, and
it also received consideration in England, France<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
Belgium, Holland<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> Italy<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
Sweden and elsewhere. In the world wide readjustment that has begun, the
efforts of the Council, past and present, will influence the plans of those who
engage in the manufacture or sale of medicines, and, undoubtedly, will be
the incentive to the establishment of similar bodies in other countries.</p>

<p>As secretary of the Council almost from the time of its organization in
1905<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> and knowing the work of its members and its collaborators, I am firmly
convinced that this body has deserved the endorsement and support given it
by the American medical profession. I welcome this opportunity to present
an outline of the Council’s past activities and to speak of some of the problems
of the future, because I feel assured that a knowledge of its endeavor to
improve drug therapy will increase the profession’s confidence in the Council
and add to the number of its supporters.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span></p>

<h5>THE COUNCIL’S ACTIVITIES</h5>

<p>Organized primarily for the purpose of putting a stop to false declarations
with regard to the composition of proprietary medicines, the Council’s activities
have broadened until its work may be characterized as “a propaganda for the
rational use of drugs.” The following are some of its activities:</p>

<p>1. <i>New and Non­official Remedies.</i>&mdash;This is an annual volume, issued by the
Council. It describes both proprietary and nonofficial, nonproprietary drugs
which are deemed worthy of consideration by the medical profession. To be
admitted to this book, a preparation must comply with certain definite rules
which stipulate, in effect, that its composition be declared, that no untrue or
grossly exaggerated claims be made for it, and that it shall give promise of
having therapeutic value.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few which are still under consideration, the Council
has considered all proprietaries whose owners or accredited agents have
requested that an examination of the products be made, and it has admitted to
the book those which were found eligible. In addition, the Council has examined
all of the more important or widely exploited proprietaries, even when no
examination was requested, and it has admitted those of this group which
were found eligible. Further, the Council has admitted to the book certain
nonofficial, nonproprietary articles which seemed to give promise of therapeutic
usefulness, and it has established standards for the control of their identity
and purity, and listed those brands which complied with these standards.</p>

<p>As most proprietary medicines are of a more or less experimental nature,
they are accepted for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies only for a
limited time&mdash;usually a period of three years. At the expiration of the period
of acceptance, each preparation is reexamined and retained only if the claims
made for it and the present day knowledge of its value permit this action.</p>

<p>Since manufacturers give information only in regard to their own products,
New and Non­official Remedies groups together articles of a similar character,
and includes in each case a general discussion of the group for the purpose of
comparison, not only with each other, but also with the established or pharmacopeial
drugs which members of the group are intended to supplant.</p>

<p>In brief, New and Non­official Remedies is a book in which are described
preparations that have been accepted by the Council. The description includes
facts that the physician should have. It is a book that should be in the hands
of every physician who prescribes medicines, and who wishes to know the facts
regarding the newest remedies. It is the only book in which he can find
information relative to proprietary medicines that are worthy of his patronage.
It will protect the physician who makes use of it against the wiles of the
promoters of products not worthy of his patronage. It would certainly be of
use to the physician when the detail man calls on him, for if he were being
importuned to prescribe or use samples of something which he had not heretofore
used and which he was unable to find in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., he might ask the
detail man why. In the nature of things few physicians are sufficiently expert
in chemistry and allied sciences to be able unerringly to discriminate between
the true and the false as regards many preparations that he is asked to
prescribe.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.</i>&mdash;A medicament
may be inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies for various reasons; it
may be worthless or irrational, its composition may be secret or indefinite, or
it may be exploited under exaggerated or unwarranted claims or in a way
otherwise detrimental to the public health and scientific medicine. Of these
various reasons which make an article unacceptable, the manufacturer obviously
<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>may remove all except the first, viz., worthlessness or irrationality. Consequently,
a preparation which has been presented for admission is not definitely
rejected until after its proprietor has been informed of the objections to his
product and has failed to bring the preparation in conformity with the Council’s
rules. When a preparation is found definitely inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, that is, when the proprietor cannot or will not make it
acceptable, the Council prepares a report for publication. These reports are
sent for publication to <span class="smcap">The Journal of the American Medical Association</span>,
and later published in the annual “Reports of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry.” The more important of these are also published in the book,
“The Propaganda for Reform in Proprietary Medicines.”</p>

<p>3. <i>Useful Drugs.</i>&mdash;Since the domination of proprietary medicines, which was
retarding medical advance and threatening therapeutic chaos, had been made
possible only by the insufficient and inefficient instruction given in medical
schools in subjects having to do with drugs, the Council appointed a Committee
on Medical Teaching to secure the cooperation of teachers in materia
medica, pharmacology and related branches. This committee has endeavored
to effect an improvement in these courses of instruction. One of the results
of this work was the selection of a list of drugs to serve as a basis of materia
medica instruction and thus insure that medical students shall be better
informed with regard to the therapeutic worth of a few well established drugs,
rather than, as in the past, leaving school with a smattering of knowledge about
many drugs. The outcome of these efforts is the publication of “Useful Drugs,”
a concise but thorough and up-to-date discussion of the actions, uses and dosage
of the more important drugs. The list of drugs presented in this book is now
the basis of instruction in many schools; and many state examining boards
are confining their materia medica questions to the drugs in the list.</p>

<p>4. <i>Epitome of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. and N.&nbsp;F.</i>&mdash;To encourage the use of official drugs
and to make available an estimate of their therapeutic value, a committee of
the Council prepared an abstract of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia and the National
Formulary. This booklet, the “Epitome of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia and
National Formulary,” presents those portions of these books which are of
interest to physicians, and in addition, gives a concise statement of the
therapeutic usefulness of the drugs and preparations described in them.</p>

<p>5. <i>Patent Law Reform.</i>&mdash;Some of the worst abuses connected with the
exploitation of proprietary medicines have been made possible by our patent
and trademark laws and the method of their interpretation and enforcement.
The Council, therefore, appointed a committee to study these laws and the
various propositions advanced for their improvement. This committee has
published, from time to time, reports on various phases of our patent and
trademark laws and recently summarized these reports in an <span class="nowrap">address<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> sent
to the commissioner of patents and the interested congressional committees.
It is hoped that by means of these reports physicians will be enabled to give
intelligent support to a revision of the patent and trademark laws when legislation
is proposed.</p>

<p>6. <i>Therapeutic Research.</i>&mdash;Through its Committee on Therapeutic Research,
and with the aid of funds provided by the Board of Trustees of the American
Medical Association, the Council has encouraged the investigations of questions
which might lead to a better understanding of the action of drugs. These
investigations are brought together in the annual reports of the Committee on
Therapeutic Research, and are an important addition to our knowledge of
drug action.</p>

<p>In the past, the Council has in particular encouraged the investigation of
the action and therapeutic value of widely used drugs regarding which our
<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>knowledge is still unsatisfactory. These investigations have included a study
of the action of strychnin in cardiac disease, a comparison of the action of
absorption and excretion of iodid preparations, a study of the pharmacology
of the opium alkaloids, etc. Appreciating that the available knowledge of
proprietary drugs is one sided in that it comes from investigations made by
interested pharmaceutical concerns or from investigations made at the instigation
of these firms, the Council is planning a comprehensive study of many
of the synthetic drugs that have gained some vogue during recent years.</p>


<h5>THE FUTURE</h5>

<p>Medical research, and efficient instruction in therapeutics and related subjects,
spell a diminishing influence of commercial medicine over rational therapeutics.
The fact that the present shortage of German synthetics has not
handicapped seriously the practice of medicine should be a lesson to American
physicians for many years to come.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be remembered that the publicity given to the
reports of the Council and to other contributions toward rational therapeutics
by <span class="smcap">The Journal of the American Medical Association</span>, the journals of the
state organizations, and a few personally owned publications, is as nothing
when compared with the persistent and wide publicity given to the propaganda
of the proprietary houses. While a report setting forth the objections to a
proprietary is published but once, the firm’s laudatory pronouncement goes
forth again and again until the Council’s report is completely overwhelmed
and forgotten. Manufacturers of proprietaries not only keep in close
touch with the practicing physician by means of house organs, special “literature,”
or by traveling representatives, but many of the firms, through the
meritorious lines of pills, tablets, tinctures, etc., which they put out, also obtain
and hold the good will and confidence of a large proportion of the medical
profession.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some of these firms may gain the confidence of the medical
profession through these high grade pharmaceuticals, and certain of their
proprietaries may be of distinct therapeutic value but may fail to be
acceptable for New and Non­official Remedies, because they do not conform
to the reasonable rules of the Council. These firms do not find it profitable
to force the sale of their regular nonproprietary pharmaceuticals by unwarranted
claims or objectionable methods, yet they may consider it good business
to market certain proprietary products by means of claims which are extravagant
and without warrant, and which will lead to indiscriminate use by the
profession and the public. In a word, where there is one dollar spent on behalf
of rational medicine, thousands are spent for the purpose of increasing the sale
of preparations which directly or indirectly are a detriment to the public
health, to medicine, and to the pocketbook.</p>

<p>That the day of the secret nostrum of the pseudo-chemical company is not
yet past is well illustrated by the recent introduction of an asserted arsphenamin
preparation called “Syphilodol.” The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory proved
one form of this asserted French discovery to be essentially a pill of mercurous
iodid. Another form of Syphilodol (for intravenous administration) had all
the characteristics of water, and appeared devoid of any potent ingredient.
Though the advertising sent out by the promoters in regard to its composition
was suspiciously evasive, the <i>Illinois Medical Journal</i> published an advertisement
of “Syphilodol,” which, possibly by a coincidence, appeared above an
appeal to “Our Readers” to use wares advertised in that journal.</p>

<p>While such rank deceptions as “Syphilodol” are not common, there are more
subtle deceptions that are even more dangerous. Types of widely exploited
remedies of today comprise so-called ethical specialties composed of well known
and established drugs (with “jokers” hidden away somewhere) or preparations
<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>which have a plausibly fascinating pseudo-scientific background of radiant
energy, colloidal chemistry, nonspecific protein reaction, or something of the
sort. The latter class of preparations in particular appeal to physicians who
are striving hard to keep pace with modern science. Exposure of their fallacies
requires most careful consideration on the part of the Council.</p>

<p>Progress toward a rational and scientific drug therapy must continue, and,
therefore, it is important that the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry should
continue to make the investigation of proprietary medicines its chief work.
Investigation of a proprietary medicine, however, and a report of such investigation
are of value in direct ratio only to the number of physicians who read
the report, endorse it and act in accordance with its conclusions. In order
that you may determine to what extent those preparations which are admitted
to New and Non­official Remedies deserve your interest and confidence, it will
be worth while briefly to outline the rules which govern the Council in the
admission of articles to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>


<h5>RULES GOVERNING THE ACCEPTANCE OF ARTICLES FOR N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h5>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Rules 1 and 2, and in a measure 5, 7, and 9, deal with the
composition of articles. Rule 1 requires that the quantitative composition of
an article be furnished the Council for publication. Rule 2 requires that the
manufacturer furnish methods whereby the composition of products that are
definite chemicals or the potent constituents of mixtures may be determined.
The Council does not require that the process of manufacture of an article be
declared unless this becomes necessary in order to judge its composition.
Rule 5 requires that statements with regard to the origin and source of an
article shall be truthful. Rule 7 requires that for the guidance of the dispenser,
the amounts of poisonous ingredients of a preparation be placed on the label.
Rule 9 requires that if patent rights are claimed for a product, the Council
be informed on this point.</p>

<p>That it is not only the right but also the duty of the physician to know
the composition of what he prescribes for his patients is so generally admitted
that few have attempted to market preparations of avowedly secret composition.
When the Council first began its work, it was common to see chemical formulas
or statements of composition published which a chemist or a pharmacist was
able to pronounce at a glance as impossible<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> It was not unusual to find that
the promoter published “a formula” for his preparation, rather than “the
formula.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> Today, however, a more prudent, if not more honest, course is
pursued. This gives a “formula” which is correct so far as it goes, but which
fails to divulge the actual composition of a preparation. When it is considered
that many physicians are not any too conversant with the chemistry and
pharmacy of drugs, it is not surprising that some administered the proprietary
“Venarsen,” regarding the composition of which they had only the vague
statement that it was “<span class="ell">..</span>. a comparatively nontoxic organic arsenic compound,
0.6&nbsp;gm. representing 247&nbsp;mg. (3<span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grains) of metallic arsenic in
chemical combination&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” in the belief that a preparation similar to that
first introduced as salvarsan was being used. That “Venarsen” contained its
arsenic as sodium cacodylate&mdash;a notoriously inactive state of combination&mdash;does
not justify the intravenous administration of a drug of unknown
composition.</p>

<p>While for the present it probably is not feasible to require, on the part
of those who manufacture medicinal preparations, such professional training
as is required of those who prescribe and those who dispense them, it certainly
is not too much to require, as does Rule 2, that a manufacturer shall
<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>be able to demonstrate that his preparation has the composition claimed for
it. Nor is it sufficient for him to know that the ingredients claimed as constituents
were used in the manufacture. The fallacy of his method of reasoning
was furnished by the physician who reported that he had personally added the
required amount of mercuric iodid for a batch of “Mercol” which, nevertheless,
was devoid of mercury<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> Acceptance of this rule by manufacturers will permit
physicians to have a more accurate knowledge of the composition of preparations
such as “Taka-Diastase<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> and “Iodeol”<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">10</a></span></p>

<p>A requirement similar to that of Rule 5 is contained in the Federal Food
and Drugs Act and so no objection has been made to this rule which requires
a truthful statement of the origin and source of articles. An illustration for
the need of the rule was furnished by the one time popular “Vin Mariani<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
which, though very French in its makeup, was found to be largely of the “made
in the United States” variety of tipple.</p>

<p>The issuance of a patent for a medicinal product does not prove that such
a product presents a discovery or that its owner is entitled to a temporary
monopoly, yet it is only fair to physicians and to other manufacturers that
notice of such patent claims be given. Hence, the Council publishes in New
and Non­official Remedies the information bearing on this point.</p>

<p><i>Lay Advertising.</i>&mdash;Rules 3 and 4 provide against the recognition of articles
that are advertised to the public directly or indirectly, exempting from this
requirement preparations which the Council believes are safe to be so
advertised.</p>

<p>It has been held with some justice that certain shotgun proprietaries are
purchased by the public with as much circumspection as they are ordered by
those physicians who are addicted to the prescribing of them; but even the
exploiters of these mixtures have not denied that the use of medicines by
the public on its own initiative is surrounded with many objections. Hence
the practice of self medication should not be encouraged by prescribing or
using those preparations advertised for public use.</p>

<p>The only objection to the rule has come from a firm which markets a
brand of liquid petrolatum, the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. The Council
has considered the question of exempting simple laxatives from the restrictions
of Rules 3 and 4 as it has exempted antiseptics and nonmedicinal foods. The
conclusion was, however, that the excessive use of a simple laxative like a
liquid petrolatum, when prompted by newspaper exploitation, is likely to be
detrimental to health by overuse as well as by misuse.</p>

<p>The indirect advertisement to the public, which Rule 4 provides against,
has been the means of inducing the extensive lay use of “Antikamnia,” “Bromidia”
and “Fellows’ Syrup.” Naturally Rule 4 has been bitterly opposed by most
proprietary firms. Arguing that many physicians dispense their own drugs,
pharmaceutical firms have insisted that every medicinal preparation should
bear on its label, not only the dose of the preparation, but also a statement
of the diseases in which the article is indicated. Whether manufacturers
anticipated the profession’s resentment toward the claim that physicians
determine the treatment and perhaps the diagnosis by means of the statements
on labels, or because the Shirley amendment to the Food and Drugs Act makes
the proprietor responsible for therapeutic claims on the label of a medicine,
it is a fact that fewer preparations than formerly need to be refused on account
<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>of infringement on this rule. In fact, some thoroughly objectionable proprietaries
make a show of being “ethical” by omitting all therapeutic discussion from the
labels of their preparations.</p>

<p><i>Therapeutic Claims.</i>&mdash;Rule 6 makes ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies any articles regarding which the manufacturer or his agents make
unwarranted, exaggerated or misleading statements as to the therapeutic value.
Recognizing the long established custom of therapeutic exaggeration, it has
been most difficult to determine the degree of conservatism which might with
fairness be required of a manufacturer. In view of the common acceptance of
individual impressions as dependable evidence, it is often almost embarrassing
to declare as incompetent the statement of some well meaning and all-too-kind-hearted
doctor. However, as the pitfalls of haphazard clinical trials
become better known and the physician’s mistrust of glowing accounts of
marvelous cures more outspoken, the manufacturers’ claims will be more
moderate.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature.</i>&mdash;Were it possible to enact and enforce a law which would
oblige manufacturers to sell their medicinal products under properly descriptive
names and which would make it illegal for a physician to prescribe it unless
he understood the meaning of such properly descriptive titles, then the Council
might safely disband. In that case, physicians would discontinue the use of
most proprietary preparations in favor of established drugs, and successful
newcomers might each year be counted on the fingers of one hand. Such a
rational nomenclature is not to be thought of, at least in our generation. Rule
8 requires that the name of an article shall not be misleading, that it shall
not be thera­peutically suggestive, and that established drugs shall not be disguised
by fanciful titles. It recognizes the right of discoverers of new drugs
to name their discoveries, and interposes no objection to arbitrary names for
such products so long as such names are not misleading or do not suggest
the therapeutic uses of the products. As the rule provides against the recognition
of coined names for established nonproprietary drugs, so it requires that
mixtures of drugs shall bear names descriptive of their composition. It would
be a long step forward if physicians would recognize more fully the objections
to the many proprietaries which have, as their only point of originality, a non-descriptive
name for an old drug or a mixture of well known drugs. It is an
encouraging sign that the Federal Trade Commission, when issuing licenses
for the manufacture of synthetic drugs introduced under German patents,
stipulated that all manufacturers authorized to make a given drug shall use
the same name for it.</p>

<p><i>Irrational Articles.</i>&mdash;Rule 10 provides against the recognition of an article
which, because of its composition, is useless or inimical to the best interests
of the public and medical profession. This rule excludes medicaments which
(1) are unessential modifications of established articles, or (2) are of no
therapeutic value or (3) are irrational. With regard to the recognition of
mixtures or compounds containing two or more active ingredients, the Council
requires that the manufacturer establish the rationality of its combination.
The rule has prevented the recognition of many unnecessary so-called ethical
specialties. Though a mass of testimonials was often to be had for them,
these contained no evidence that the mixture was superior to its potent
ingredient, or that its therapeutic effect had been determined. That there is
a healthy tendency to use single drugs for their definite action and to discard
combinations (be they shotgun proprietaries or “mixed” vaccines) is perhaps
best illustrated by the fact that at the last revision of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
a considerable number of complex antiquities were omitted from that book.</p>

<p>Feeling confident that this meets with the endorsement of the profession,
the Council is examining more critically the evidence for the value of pharmaceutical
mixtures.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 10, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>“ACCEPTED BY THE COUNCIL ON PHARMACY
AND CHEMISTRY”</h3>


<p>Under the caption given above, the <i>Journal of the Missouri State Medical
Association</i>, in its July issue, speaks editorially as follows:</p>

<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association
is a department of our national organization that has not received the
plaudits and encomiums of a wildly joyous medical profession nor the grateful
praises of the enthusiastic manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. The Council
seems indeed to be the unloved child of the entire family of subsidiary bodies
of the association. Perhaps the reason for this may be found in the character
of its duties, for the Council must expose fraud, sometimes in high places, and
protect the physician from being duped by avaricious persons and by persons
who are themselves sometimes the victims of their own credulity. It thus
happens that the sale of some proprietary article previously held in high esteem
by the practitioner proves valueless, perhaps even fraudulent. The practitioner,
however, may have credited much of his success in treating certain conditions
to that preparation and the maker has had success in accumulating dollars
from its sale and both parties emit a loud and vicious roar against the Council,
because they both lose money. Nobody wants to be “protected” against making
money&mdash;make it honestly, if possible, but make it&mdash;but this black sheep among
the Councils of the American Medical Association insists on their making
their money honestly!</p>

<p>Despite many obstacles thrown into its path, the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry has serenely pursued its allotted tasks, corrected its mistakes,
improved its methods, and today stands as the only medium to which the honest
physician may turn for information&mdash;not misinformation&mdash;regarding proprietary
articles. During the war the Council and the chemical laboratory were in close
cooperation with the Surgeon-General’s Office, testing and investigating every
article offered to the government for the treatment of sick soldiers. The variety
and the number of fakish and fraudulent stuff offered to the Surgeon-General
was a pitiable exhibit of the mental gymnastics of some people. Just now
the Council and the laboratory have a new and important field before them,
i.&nbsp;e., to protect the physicians against worthless and useless serums, vaccines
and synthetics. It will be the Council’s unpleasant duty to expose the fraudulent
and useless among these articles and stamp truth on those found worthy.</p>

<p>We seem to have wandered from the topic in our caption, but not so in
reality, because the burden of our thought is to lend our influence to the spread
of the motto of the Advertising Clubs of the World, namely, “Truth in Advertising.”
It is our purpose to stimulate a larger degree of enthusiasm for the
work of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and the Chemical Laboratory,
a more generous flow of inquiries concerning articles unfamiliar to the physician,
and particularly to urge that the words “Accepted by the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association” be printed
on the label and on all advertising circulars of proprietary articles that have
been admitted to New and Non­official Remedies. Then, when pamphlets and
circulars are received by physicians they will read the statements of manufacturers
with sympathetic understanding and with full confidence in the
verity of the declarations. The importance of creating just that sort of
receptivity in the mind of the prospective buyer is so well known to the astute
publicity expert that it is needless for us to dwell on its advantages. Every
proprietary article advertised in our journal, in <span class="smcap">The Journal of the American
Medical Association</span>, and in the other state association journals, as well as in
several well-edited privately owned journals, does in effect say to the reader
that the articles so advertised are accepted by the Council because only proprietary
articles so accepted are accepted by us. The fact is further acknowledged
<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>when these firms are permitted to exhibit their goods at our annual
sessions for again the rule is enforced that only proprietary articles which
have been approved by the Council may be placed on display.</p>

<p>Why not complete the circle of ideas&mdash;it would not be a “vicious circle”&mdash;by
printing on labels, in advertisements and circulars, the words: “Accepted
by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry”?&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
Aug. 2, 1919.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>HELPING THE COUNCIL</h3>


<p>If they were built that way, the members of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry of the American Medical Association might become discouraged at
the apparent indifference of many members of the medical profession to their
efforts. There are many physicians who, while figuratively patting the Council
on the back, actually do nothing to aid its efforts. On the other hand, there
are men in the profession who give the Council active support instead of merely
passive appreciation. The letter that follows was written by such a man to
a pharmaceutical concern:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am receiving circular advertising from you concerning &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;
solution, and I am writing to suggest that until these products have been
approved by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical
Association, you are wasting your postage on the practice. Aside from
the fact that these products do not appeal to me personally, I feel that I am
not in a position to judge the value of such products and I depend entirely
on the large clinical opportunities of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
of the American Medical Association in addition to their laboratory facilities,
in such matters as these. I may, therefore, with all due respect, suggest
that <span class="ell">..</span>. it will pay you to eliminate my name from your mailing list.</p></div>

<p>The members of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry are working week
in and week out without remuneration. Few appreciate how much these scientific
men are doing for rational therapeutics; fewer still realize how much has
been accomplished through their efforts, or how much more could be accomplished
if every physician who at least believes in the work of the Council
would give it his full support.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov.
6, 1920.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>DELAYS IN PASSING ON PRODUCTS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Council frequently receives inquiries&mdash;some of them accompanied by
expressions of impatience&mdash;concerning articles, reports on which appear to be
delayed. It therefore seems advisable to make a statement of some of the
factors which enter into this problem.</p>

<p>The Council fully realizes the importance of giving prompt information to
the profession with regard to proprietary medicines under consideration. It
therefore acts as soon as sufficient information is available to justify a definite
judgment, and publishes its conclusions as soon as possible. When adequate
information is available at the outset, there is no delay in the publication of
the Council’s conclusions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, but very naturally, there are many cases in which the information
available at the time the product is submitted is not sufficient to
justify the Council in coming to definite conclusions for or against the preparation.
In some cases the manufacturer possesses the required information, but
to obtain it from him takes time; in other cases the manufacturer does not
<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>possess the information&mdash;perhaps he did not realize the inadequacy of his evidence
until the subject was brought to his attention by the Council.</p>

<p>Such cases might be dealt with in either one of two ways: The Council
might at once reject the article because the claims for it are not supported by
adequate evidence; or, the Council might suspend judgment and give the
manufacturer an opportunity to supply the information.</p>

<p>The first method&mdash;immediate rejection&mdash;would obviously be felt by manufacturers
as a hardship. To afford the fullest possible opportunity for the
presentation of the case, the Council follows the second method; that is, it
suspends judgment and withholds publication of a report until reasonable
time has been afforded for furnishing the required information, provided the
manufacturer or agent appears to be making honest and diligent efforts to
supply it. The collection and compilation of such information is sometimes
a lengthy process, especially when the products are of foreign manufacture.</p>

<p>Although it would be easier for the Council to render an immediate decision
than to assist manufacturers to supply the data necessary for the formation
of an authoritative judgment, the Council cannot yield to importunities for
hasty action. It must rely on the medical profession to bear in mind that
the character of a product under consideration by the Council has not yet
been determined. The Council holds that, during this stage, a product is
suitable, at most, for experimental use.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry, 1915, p.&nbsp;119.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>COOPERATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL HOUSES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>In reply to the suggestion made last year by President Bevan that there
should be closer cooperation between the large pharmaceutical houses and the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, the Council submitted to the Board of
Trustees of the American Medical Association the statement which appears
below:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Cooperation of the Pharmaceutical Houses</span>: At the opening meeting of the House
of Delegates last year, President Arthur Dean Bevan suggested the desirability of greater
cooperation between the large pharmaceutical houses and the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.
The need of such cooperation has been recognized by the Council from the first. In
no one direction has the Council made greater effort than in its endeavor to secure the fullest
cooperation of the various pharmaceutical houses. The difficulty has been, and always must
be, the fundamental antagonism between objectives that are largely commercial on the one
hand and purely scientific on the other. Nevertheless, the Council has always believed&mdash;and
has acted on the belief&mdash;that there is a possible middle ground wherein the interests of therapeutics
would not be injured but would go hand in hand with a commercial development
based on enlightened self-interest.</p>

<p>“The profits to be made by a pharmaceutical house from the sale of a staple drug&mdash;a pharmacopeial,
National Formulary, or nonproprietary preparation&mdash;which enters into free competition
with other drugs of the same kind, are moderate; the profits to be made from the sale
of a proprietary medicine on which the manufacturer holds a monopoly are usually large&mdash;sometimes
enormous. There are, broadly, two kinds of proprietary preparations advertised
to physicians: One represents laborious research ending in the production of a new medicinal
chemical; this product can be patented and the manufacturer can obtain a seventeen-year
monopoly on its manufacture and sale. The other represents no research but comprises simple
mixtures&mdash;frequently of the “shotgun” variety&mdash;of well known pharmaceuticals, or biologic
products sold under trade names. As these do not represent anything new or original the
manufacturer is unable to obtain a patent, but by means of the trade name he can and does
obtain a perpetual monopoly. This, from a business standpoint, is more valuable than the
limited monopoly granted by a patent. It is not surprising that proprietary remedies of the
latter type flourish so long as physicians unthinkingly accept and prescribe them solely on
the manufacturer’s valuation.</p>

<p>“The Council has practically the undivided support of manufacturers of medicinal chemicals;
that is, of proprietaries of the first mentioned type. But pharmaceutical firms which
have found it profitable to promote proprietaries of the second type&mdash;“specialties,” unscientific
or ordinary mixtures of pharmaceuticals or biologic products sold under trade names&mdash;have
not supported the Council.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
<p>“When the Council was organized, it was hoped and believed that all the large pharmaceutical
houses would find it possible and desirable, if not actually more profitable, to shape
their business methods so as to make their proprietary and other articles conform to those
conservative standards on which the Council bases its rules, and thus render such articles
acceptable for New and Non­official Remedies. It soon developed, however, that the methods
of the pseudochemical companies, whose sales propaganda in the interest of unscientific nostrums
with its attending damage to scientific medicine had led to the establishment of the
Council, had found their lodgment in most of the pharmaceutical houses. It was a genuine
disappointment to the Council to find that some of the large and old-established firms were
not only unwilling to cooperate with the Council, but in many instances exhibited a definite
antagonism to the Council’s work.</p>

<p>“The object&mdash;and duty&mdash;of the officers of pharmaceutical houses is primarily to pay dividends
to their stockholders. Through skilful advertising or the persuasiveness of “detail
men,” they are able to induce physicians to prescribe their controlled products, on which there
are large profits, even though such products have not only not been accepted by the Council,
but in many instances, have been disapproved. Is it any wonder that concerns which put
out such products are indifferent or openly antagonistic to the work of the Council? The
matter is largely one of business policy. When the medical profession as a unit will support
the Council in its work, then such firms will find it good business policy to accede to Dr.
Bevan’s suggestion&mdash;but not before.”</p></div>

<p>Evidently the problem resolves itself into this: The Council, constituted
of scientific men, working without remuneration in the interest of scientific
medicine and the medical profession, expects&mdash;and rightfully&mdash;the cooperation
and support of the members of that profession. What is needed, therefore, is
the active, sympathetic cooperation of physicians; the cooperation of pharmaceutical
houses will follow as a matter of course. (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>74</b>:1235 [May 1]
1920.)</p>

<p>The following is the recommendation of the Reference Committee to which
the Report of the Board of Trustees was referred: “A perusal of the Trustees’
Report, ‘Cooperation of the Pharmaceutical Houses’, is well worth the time
of every member of the profession, and your committee would emphasize the
statement of the Trustees: ‘The Council, constituted of scientific men, working
without remuneration in the interest of scientific medicine and the medical
profession expects&mdash;and rightfully&mdash;the cooperation and support of the members
of that profession. What is needed, therefore, is the active sympathetic
cooperation of physicians; the cooperation of pharmaceutical houses will follow
as a matter of course.’</p>

<p>“Your committee would go still further and move that a vote of thanks of
the House be extended to those scientific men who have devoted so much
valuable time to the welfare of the Association.”</p>

<h3>BUDWELL’S EMULSION OF COD-LIVER OIL,<br />NOS. 1 AND 2</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Budwell Pharmacal Company, Lynchburg, Virginia, which markets these
preparations, claims that “No. 1” contains cod liver oil, “Iodide of Arsenic,”
“Iodide of Calcium,” and “Iodide of Manganese.” “No. 2” is said to contain
in addition to the ingredients of No. 1, creosote carbonate and guaiacol.</p>

<p>It is known that arsenous iodid is decomposed by contact with water. It
is recognized that creosote carbonate is unstable and prone to liberate creosote.
Iodide of manganese not being official, the supply on the market is not controlled
in any way: Tests of purity are not prescribed by the Pharmacopeia,
the National Formulary, New and Non­official Remedies or other books of
standards. Therefore doubt must be expressed as to the accuracy of the formulas
as given. The Council cannot accept such statements of composition
without further evidence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>
<p>“No. 1” is commended for use in</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Chronic Rheumatism, Glandular Swellings, later forms of Syphilis, convalescence from
Scarlet Fever, La Grippe and Malaria, Chronic Malarial Infection, Marasmus, Joint or other
suppuration of standing, diseases of skin, chorea, anaemia, neurasthenia, obstinate neuralgia,
scrofulous affections in general, and diarrhea or dysentery (subacute or chronic) in childhood.”</p></div>

<p>“No. 2” is said to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Prepared especially for the treatment of Chronic Throat, Nasal, Bronchial and Pulmonary
Diseases.”</p></div>

<p>In the advertising circular statements regarding the various ingredients
of Budwell’s Emulsion are quoted from obsolete text books. These statements,
for the most part, do not represent modern opinions on the subject. For
instance, the circular praises the action of guaiacol as eliminated directly by
the lungs, thus exerting a beneficial local effect and causing bacilli to diminish
in numbers or to disappear. All of this is directly contradicted in authoritative
modern publications on pharmacology, which hold that the excretion of guaiacol
by the lungs is infinitesimal and its action on bacilli is nil. The Council held
the preparations in conflict with its rules as follows:</p>

<p>1. Many of the therapeutic claims are exaggerations.</p>

<p>2. The method of exploitation amounts to an indirect invitation to the public
to use these preparations as “consumption cures.”</p>

<p>3. The preparations are unscientific, they constitute a reprehensible invitation
to uncritical prescribing and their use is inimical to the best interests
of the profession and the public. It is difficult to imagine in what conditions
such a combination would be indicated. These preparations are a remnant of
the days of polypharmacy. Their use is not in keeping with present medical
thought and practice.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 20, 1915.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>RHEUMALGINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Rheumalgine (Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis) is put up both in tablet form
and as a liquid. Each tablet, or teaspoonful of the liquid, is said to contain:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">“Strontium salicylate from Natural Oil</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">5&nbsp;gr.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">&#8196;Hexamethylenamin</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">2&nbsp;gr.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">&#8196;Colchicine</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03"><span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.”</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The advertising matter contains several statements regarding the individual
ingredients to which objection must be made.</p>

<p>It is claimed (quoting from Hare) that strontium salicylate</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. is not so disagreeable to the taste as the corresponding sodium salts, and more
important still, it is far less apt to disorder the stomach.”</p></div>

<p>“Taste” is a difficult subject to dispute; but in the experience of the referee,
patients object more to the strontium than to the sodium salt. No evidence is
submitted to prove that the strontium salt is less apt to disorder the stomach.
In observations made under the direction of the referee, the nauseant and
emetic doses are about the same as, or even less than, those of sodium salicylate.</p>

<p>Under hexa­methylen­amin, the recommendations are not confined to its recognized
use as a urinary antiseptic; it is also said to be “unexcelled” as a
“germicide,” and to prevent the formation of urate and phosphate deposits.
These statements are contrary to facts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rheumalgine <span class="ell">..</span>. may be used in all cases where the salicylates are indicated. It is
superior to preparations containing sodium salicylate, in that it does not cause nausea or disturb
the digestion.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span></p>
<p>Both the preceding statements are misleading. The necessity of giving <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub></span>
grain of colchicin for each 5 grains of salicylate would certainly interfere with
the use of adequate doses of the latter. The colchicin would produce digestive
disturbance quite apart from the salicylate.</p>

<p>The mixture is described as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. ANTIRHEUMATIC, ANTIPYRETIC, URINARY ANTISEPTIC, AND URIC
ACID ELIMINANT. Useful in Acute Articular and Chronic Rheumatism, Muscular Pains,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Migraine of the Rheumatic, Gout, and in Nervous Irritability of the
Gouty or Lithemic.”</p></div>

<p>The facts are: Salicylates are useful in some of these conditions, colchicin
occasionally in a few, hexa­methylen­amin in none. The combination is conducive
to uncritical prescribing. For instance, salicylates are effective in acute
articular rheumatism; hexa­methylen­amin and colchicin are useless; salicylates
are of very little use in chronic rheumatism, sciatica and nervous irritability,
while hexa­methylen­amin and colchicin are useless in these conditions; colchicin
is sometimes effective in gout, salicylates perhaps also; hexa­methylen­amin
is not.</p>

<p>Attention should also be called to the high dosage of colchicin, namely,
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub></span> of a grain of the alkaloid, every three or four hours, the dose then
to be “slightly reduced,” but continued for several days; or in chronic cases,
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub></span> grain per day, continued indefinitely. This dosage appears high, if
a really active preparation is used.</p>

<p>Finally, the name “Rheumalgine” encourages thoughtless and unscientific
prescribing. If a mixture is used at all, the prescriber should be constantly
reminded of its composition.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended that Rheumalgine be held in conflict with
Rules 6 (unwarranted therapeutic claims), 8 (nondescriptive name) and 10
(unscientific composition).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 26, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>GRAY’S GLYCERINE TONIC</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Gray’s Glycerine Tonic Comp. (Purdue Frederick Company, New York)
is a mixture said to be made according to a prescription of the late Dr. John
P. Gray, superintendent of the state hospital, Utica, New York. As to the composition,
the following statement is furnished by the company:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This preparation is a combination of Glycerine, Sherry Wine, Gentian, Taraxacum and
Phosphoric Acid with carminatives.”</p></div>

<p>The label declares the presence of 11 per cent. alcohol, and the dose is
given at from two teaspoonfuls to a tablespoonful. A study of the ingredients
will show that, aside from the alcohol, the mixture contains but one really
active drug, gentian. Essentially, then, “Gray’s Glycerine Tonic” is a mixture
which, in addition to the narcotic effect of the alcohol, depends on a bitter,
gentian, for whatever therapeutic action it may possess.</p>

<p>The bitters, of which gentian is a type, were once credited with many therapeutic
virtues which time has shown they do not possess. Pharmacologic
research has demonstrated that their utility consists in stimulating the appetite
through their action on the taste buds. On this account they were believed
also to increase the secretion of the gastric juice by a psychic impression.
More recently, however, even this has been questioned&mdash;by Carlson, for instance.</p>

<p>These facts are fully understood, presumably, by all physicians. Yet,
according to the advertising circular, this “tonic,” which, for all practical purposes,
is merely a simple bitter, is good for thirty-two diseases ranging from
amenorrhea to whooping cough!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span></p>
<p>The conditions in which Gray’s Glycerine Tonic is asserted to be especially
efficient are described on the label of the bottle and the outside wrapper, in
popular terms, more or less typical of “patent medicine” exploitation, such
as “catarrhal conditions,” and “stomach derangements.” Similar statements
are contained in the leaflet accompanying the trade package. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is, therefore, an effective, reliable tonic in nervous exhaustion, general debility,
impoverished conditions of the blood and nervous system, Bright’s disease, diseases of the
liver, disorders of the urinary organs, etc.”</p>

<p>“It is an unexcelled restorative in that very common class of cases in which there is no
positive organic disease, but the patient complains that he ‘does not feel well’ or ‘is out of
sorts.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>Here are some of the claims made in other advertising matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All stages of bronchitis <span class="ell">..</span>. are rapidly improved by the use of Gray’s Glycerine
Tonic Comp. This remedy has a direct tonic influence upon the circulation of the respiratory
mucous membrane; it relieves congestion and restores tone to weakened blood vessels.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. improves the appetite, gives valuable aid to the digestive and absorptive processes,
and reinforces cellular nutrition in ways that insure a notable gain in vitality and strength.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/025.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="" />
<div>This appeared in a journal owned and controlled by the second largest state medical association
of the country.</div>
</div>

<p>Even granting that gentian may improve the appetite, how absurd it is to
claim that this mixture “relieves congestion,” “restores tone to weakened blood
vessels,” “gives aid to the absorptive processes,” “reinforces cellular nutrition,”
or increases vitality!</p>

<p>Neither the composition of Gray’s Glycerine Tonic nor the clinical evidence
warrants the belief that it has any therapeutic value other than that due to
the psychic effect of the bitter drug gentian. Physicians who have prescribed
it have done so because of the advertising. This nostrum has been kept so
constantly before the eyes of medical men that they think of Gray’s Glycerine
Tonic when they cannot remember the official drugs that may be indicated in
the case. The moral is that liberal advertising will sell anything.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Gray’s Glycerine Tonic Comp. be declared not
eligible for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies on account of conflict
with Rules 1, 6, 8 and 10.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>&mdash;An old practice in hospitals&mdash;happily now practically
obsolete&mdash;was to have certain stock mixtures prepared in bulk. Among these
<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>there was usually a so-called tonic mixture, used in a more or less haphazard
manner when nothing in particular seemed indicated. Such a stock mixture
was used in the State Hospital for the Insane at Utica, N.&nbsp;Y., during the
many years that Dr. John P. Gray was superintendent (from the early fifties
to the early eighties), although it is very doubtful whether he originated the
mixture. After the death of Dr. Gray&mdash;so the story runs&mdash;one of his sons,
with a partner, formed the firm of Purdue Frederick Company, and began the
exploitation of the elder Dr. Gray’s name, in connection, presumably, with this
stock preparation. As indicated in the Council’s report, Gray’s Glycerine Tonic
Comp.&mdash;and what an absurd name!&mdash;is simply a mixture of ordinary drugs,
requiring no skill whatever in compounding. If there is a physician living
who cannot write a prescription offhand as good as this formula, that physician
should either go back to a medical school or change his vocation. There is,
and can be, no excuse for prescribing such a ready-made mixture, for every
cross-roads drugstore has the ingredients and any pharmacist worthy of the
name could compound it. Among the scores of nostrums that disgrace the
medical profession of this country, none is more typical of all that is inimical
to scientific medicine, to the medical profession and above all to the public&mdash;for,
after all is said, it is the public that ultimately is humbugged.]&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>TONGALINE AND PONCA COMPOUND</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council, having considered “Tongaline,” “Tongaline Tablets,” “Tongaline
and Lithia Tablets,” “Tongaline and Quinine Tablets” and “Ponca Compound
Tablets,” found these preparations ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies and authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h5>TONGALINE</h5>

<p>Tongaline (Mellier Drug Co., St. Louis) is a fancy name given to what is
essentially a sodium salicylate mixture. The air of mystery created by the
name permits the manufacturers to make claims for the product which would
be ludicrous if the medical profession was fully conversant with the very
ordinary character of the preparation.</p>

<p>Tongaline receives its name from tonga, an inert, long-discarded mixture
of various barks and herbs said to be gathered and prepared by Fiji Islanders.
Its constituents evidently tend to vary with the collector. The history of the
introduction of this indefinite combination of simples is thus given in <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, May 10, 1913.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A supply of the crude drug was carried to England by a man who had lived for a short
time in the Fiji Islands and it was placed in the hands of a retail house in London. This
occurred about 1879. In 1880, two English physicians of repute published laudatory articles
on the therapeutic value of tonga in neuralgia and rheumatism. This created a demand for
the drug which extended to the United States.”</p></div>

<p>Time showed that tonga was inert thera­peutically, and authorities on pharmacology
now no longer notice it. As the Council previously reported<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> the
indefinite character of the mixture should, alone, be sufficient to exclude it
from practical therapeutics. During the temporary popularity of tonga, the
proprietary mixture Tongaline was put on the market for physicians’ use by
the Mellier Drug Company, St. Louis. In this, tonga was named as the active
ingredient. The commercial interests thus involved have faithfully nourished
and kept alive the “tonga” myth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>
<p>In a recent advertising booklet, “The Therapeutic Properties of the Ingredients
of Tongaline,” the virtues of tonga, blue cohosh, colchicum, jaborandi
and salicylic acid are discussed. The label of a recently purchased bottle reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tongaline contains Tonga, Cimicifuga Racemosa, Salicylate of Sodium (the salicylic acid
being made from pure natural oil) Colchicum and Pilocarpin.”</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that Tongaline is “made from the pure, natural oil.” In
fact, the statement is repeated in red ink, in large letters running across the
face of the label, thus emphasizing the alleged importance of this assertion.
In this connection it is only necessary to recall that it has been proved clinically,
chemically and physiologically that there is absolutely no difference between
the salicylic acid made from the natural oil and the synthetic.</p>

<p>The formula was thus commented on in the article previously quoted from
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tongaline <span class="ell">..</span>. is essentially a preparation of sodium salicylate<span class="ell">,..</span>. The Mellier
Drug Company realized the impossibility of creating any marked demand for a nostrum unless
it had some real drugs in it&mdash;hence the presence of the salicylates. What the actual composition
of Tongaline is, no one but the manufacturers know. At one time the following was
given as the formula:</p></div>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Fluid Tonga</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;&#8200;30&nbsp;grains</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Extract of Cimicifuga Racemosa</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;&#8200;20&nbsp;grains</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Sodium Salicylate</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;&#8200;10&nbsp;grains</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Pilocarpin Salicylate</span></div></td><td class="tar"><span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span>&nbsp;grain<span class="hide">s</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Colchin Salicylate</span></div></td><td class="tar"><span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub></span>&nbsp;grain<span class="hide">s</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These amounts refer to the quantity of drugs in each fluidram of the preparation.
Whether the nostrum still has this composition we do not know, but assuming that it has, it
is quite evident that sodium salicylate is the essential and active ingredient.”</p></div>

<p>The therapeutic indications given on the label of the bottle are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Grippe, Gout, Nervous Headache, Sciatica, Lumbago, Malaria,
Tonsillitis, Heavy Colds, Excess of Uric Acid, and wherever the use of the Salicylates is
indicated.”</p></div>

<p>In a recent booklet this semisecret salicylate mixture is recommended, not
only in conditions in which salicylates are indicated, but also combined with
aconite for rheumatic fever, with benzoate of soda in the treatment of “grippe,”
with potassium bromid in nervous headaches, with gelsemium, glycerin and
whisky for “heavy colds,” with ammonium chlorid, stramonium and cimicifuga
in “rheumatic dysmenorrhea,” and even with mercury biniodid as a treatment
of syphilitic eruptions!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When administered with good judgment, Tongaline exerts a stimulating effect upon every
organ of elimination; cleansing the complex sewerage system and putting it into working
order. When this is done, the sluggish blood current begins to flow more freely; the lymphatic
and glandular systems to give up and carry off the toxic products, so long retained&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>


<h5>TONGALINE TABLETS</h5>

<p>Then because of a “desire to put Tongaline in a more compact and convenient
form,” the same concern puts on the market Tongaline Tablets.
Whether Tongaline Tablets are of the same composition, the doctor who prescribes
them is not advised. In this form we have Tongaline and Lithia
Tablets, and Tongaline and Quinin Tablets. Presumably those who are
attracted by the word “lithia” are sufficiently uncritical to be content with
the statement that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The addition of Lithia to Tongaline presents a most useful combination which does not
rely upon its action on the kidneys alone as is the case with Lithia salts or Lithia waters as
administered&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>And the foregoing quotation, be it remembered, is for the information of
the medical profession! Tongaline and Lithia Tablets, we are informed, are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. particularly indicated for certain diseases which are caused by deposits of urates
in the joints and kidneys, and can be used with much benefit for many people who indulge
in generous or intemperate habits of living.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span></p>
<p>Tongaline and Quinine Tablets are also exploited without statement of
composition. The promoters are probably justified in feeling that physicians
who prescribe quinin in combination with “Tongaline” care little about the
dosage.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discuss the silly claims made for Tongaline and its
combinations, although it is worth while to point out that the prescribing of
such nostrums by physicians is an imposition, if not a fraud, on the public.</p>


<h5>PONCA COMPOUND</h5>

<p>Ponca Compound, also made by the Mellier Drug Company, St. Louis, is a
“female weakness remedy” in tablet form. The name suggests that “ponca” is
a medicinal substance, and, in fact, at one time, “Ext. Ponca” was named as an
ingredient. The nature of “Ext. Ponca” was apparently never explained. It
is now replaced in the “formula” by “senecin,” and the only information concerning
the composition at present given is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ponca Compound Tablets Contain Extract of Mitchella Repens, Senecin, Helonin, Caulophyllin
and Viburnin.”</p></div>

<p>This “formula” is practically meaningless, not only because the amount
of each ingredient is not stated, but also because “senecin,” “helonin,” “caulophyllin”
and “viburnin” are in themselves variable mixtures of unknown
composition<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">13</a></span></p>

<p>Presumably, “senecin,” “helonin,” “caulophyllin” and “viburnin” are extractives
of some kind prepared, respectively, from senecio aureus (life root),
helonias dioica (false unicorn), calophyllum thalictroides (blue cohosh) and
viburnum prunifolium or opulus (black haw or cramp bark). These are, one
and all, practically inert drugs. There is no reason to believe that any or all
of them can have any beneficial influence in the many and varied conditions
for which Ponca Compound is advertised.</p>

<p>The following are excerpts from the advertising matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ponca Compound is a remedy of a very beneficial character for Functional, Uterine and
Ovarian troubles, which will respond to internal treatment, especially when digital examination
or surgical interference is undesirable.”</p>

<p>“Ponca Compound is also valuable during gestation and after parturition.”</p>

<p>“Uterine Alterative for Leucorrhoea, Dysmenorrhoea, Amenorrhoea, Metritis, Endometritis,
Menorrhagia, Metrorrhagia, Irregular Menstruation, Subinvolution, Painful
Pregnancy.”</p></div>

<p>It is recommended that Tongaline and Ponca Compound and all their
preparations be held in conflict with Rule 1, in view of their semisecret and
indefinite composition; with Rule 6, for the grossly exaggerated therapeutic
claims made for them; with Rule 8, because of their misleading names, and with
Rule 10, in view of their unscientific character as irrational combinations. It
is also recommended that this report be published.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 17, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>ALFATONE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has found Alfatone ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies
and has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span></p>

<p>Alfalfa is good cattle feed but only nostrum exploiters have suggested its
use as a medicine for human beings. While it may seem a waste of time to
discuss the medicinal value of alfalfa its recent exploitation by the Norwich
Pharmacal Company, Norwich, N.&nbsp;Y., as “a reconstructive tonic and nutrient”
in the form of a mixture called “Alfatone,” calls for comment. According to
the label on the preparation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Each fluidounce represents:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="fs100" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Alcohol</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">&#8199;15</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Medicago sativa (Alfalfa)</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">120</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grains</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Taraxacum</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">&#8199;2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grains</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Gentian</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">&#8199;&#8199;1</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grain</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Berberine Hydrochloride</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">&#8199;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub></span></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grain</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><span class="item">Glycerin and Aromatics.”</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“Dose.&mdash;One to three fluidrams (4 to 12&nbsp;c.c.) 4 times daily.”</p></div>

<p>Each maximum dose, therefore, should represent 45 grains of alfalfa, 1
grain of taraxacum (dandelion), <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> grain of gentian, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span> grain of berberin
hydrochlorid, and 27 minims of alcohol. Since the bitter drugs are present in
such small amounts that the preparation is almost devoid of bitterness, and
as the medicinal value of alfalfa is practically nil, it is evident that whatever
action Alfatone may have is due to the stimulant effects of the alcohol.</p>

<p>Some of the claims made for Alfatone are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A reconstructive nutritive tonic indicated in general debility, neurasthenia, convalescence,
etc.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. a Galactagogue of merit as well.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. improves the appetite, aids the processes of digestion and assimilation, facilitates
elimination and effects gradual but decided gains in strength, vitality and weight.”</p></div>

<p>It is suggested that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. in case of idiosyncrasy the addition of Tr. Nux Vomica 5 to 10 minims to the
dose, unless contraindicated, will secure excellent results.”</p></div>

<p>The Norwich Pharmacal Company naively remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The dearth of medical literature on Alfalfa has lead us to present below a few of the
findings of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the Department of Agriculture <span class="ell">..</span>. as well
as those from several state experiment stations&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Here are the “findings”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Digestible nutrients in 100 pounds of Alfalfa<span class="ell">,..</span>. Protein, 11.0 pounds;
Carbohydrates, 39.6 pounds; Ether Extract, 1.2 pounds.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The high value of Alfalfa is due to the amount of protein that it contains; to
the large percentage of protein that is digestible and the palatability of Alfalfa.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Table showing pounds of elements removed from the soil by one ton of crop.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="fs100" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"></td><td class="tac">Alfalfa</td><td class="tac pl17">Wheat</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Potash</span></div></td><td class="tar pr03">49.79</td><td class="tal pl2">12.52</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Phosphoric Acid</span></div></td><td class="tar pr03"> 8.27</td><td class="tal pl2"> 9.08</td></tr>

</table></div>


<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The abundance of muscle and bone producing material in Alfalfa makes this
crop especially good.”</p></div>

<p>Thus estimates of the value of a farm crop and cattle fodder are made to
do service as testimonials to its therapeutic merit for human beings! Has the
“patent medicine” promoter ever dared to insult the intelligence of his patrons
by a cruder absurdity? Yet it is not to the nontechnical and unscientific public,
but to a profession presumably scientifically trained in pharmacology and
therapeutics that this concern presumes to offer its fodder tincture on the basis
of testimony to the agricultural value of the fodder plant.</p>

<p>Alfatone is a worthless alcoholic cordial. The audacity of the attempt to
promote its sale by a discourse on the merits of a well-known fodder plant is
<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>the sole reason for devoting any attention to it. It is recommended that Alfatone
be held ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies, and that this report be
published.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>&mdash;What a comment on American medicine that a concern
can even contemplate the possibility of making a commercial success of the
sale of such a silly nostrum as Alfatone! And yet, when one remembers that
a proprietary in which oats constitutes one ingredient (“Pas-Avena”) for years
has been advertised to physicians and presumably prescribed by them, it is not
altogether inexplicable that business men should get the impression that the
medical profession is “easy” enough to “fall for” anything in the line of
proprietary mixtures. Perhaps we may look forward to being offered proprietaries
based on other cheap and well-known fodder plants. Tincture of Timothy
Hay, Blue Grass Tonic, Cornhusk Wine! Why not? The enterprising companies
that may put them out can easily publish tables to show the digestible
nutrients in each and indubitable testimony can be furnished to prove the
excellence of any of them as stock feed. If a pitchforkful of timothy hay makes
a good fattening ration for a growing steer why should not a teaspoonful of
tincture of timothy hay make a “reconstructive tonic and nutrient” dose for
a man? If an arm load of thistles (carduus) makes a luscious food for <i>equus
asinus</i> why should not a pinch of thistle in alcohol and water be a good “tonic”?
Great are the possibilities! They are limited only by the gullibility of the
medical profession and the public. Certain it is that some proprietary manufacturers
are firmly convinced that no combination can be too preposterous
to be worth trying on the medical profession.]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>ARTICLES REFUSED RECOGNITION</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Below appear abstracts of the Council’s actions on articles refused recognition
which were not deemed of sufficient importance to require lengthy reports.</p>


<h4>Uricsol</h4>

<p>Uricsol is marketed by the Uricsol Chemical Company, formerly of Los
Angeles, now of Boston. Regarding its composition only vague statements are
made. In an advertising pamphlet it is promised that the formula will be
sent to physicians on request. Such a request from a physician elicited the
following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“URICSOL is a non-irritating, alkaline solution, containing Lithium Citrate, Acid Citric
and Potassium Nitrate, together with a saline laxative in the form of Glycero Sodium Phosphate,
with Vegetable Tonics added.”</p></div>

<p>The Association Laboratory has made an examination of Uricsol to determine
its composition and reports as follows:</p>

<h5>LABORATORY REPORT</h5>

<p>A trade package purchased in March, 1915, from a wholesale drug house
was labeled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Uricsol Rheumatic Remedy, Uric Acid Solvent, Kidney and Liver Stimulant, Manufactured
by the Uricsol Chemical Co., Los Angeles, Cal.”</p></div>

<p>This package was wrapped in a circular entitled “The Great California
Remedy&mdash;Uricsol.” The preparation is a viscid, slightly turbid light brown
liquid, with a faintly aromatic odor and a salty, bitter taste. The diluted
solution is acid in reaction toward litmus and phenol­phthalein and alkaline
toward methyl orange.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>
<p>Qualitative tests showed a presence of phosphate, citrate, nitrate, sodium,
glycerin, and a small amount of lithium in aqueous solution. Besides these
a small amount of some organic, nonalkaloidal substance was found, which
from its bitter taste suggested gentian. From the qualitative tests it appeared
that the phosphate was the predominating ingredient and accordingly a phosphate
determination was made. The results, calculated to sodium phosphate,
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., indicated the presence of 64.20&nbsp;gm. per 100&nbsp;c.c., held in solution by
citric acid and sodium nitrate.</p>

<p>Uricsol evidently is a solution containing a large amount of sodium phosphate
with small amounts of lithium, nitrate, citric acid and glycerin, with
probably some vegetable extract.</p>

<p>In general Uricsol is similar to the once widely exploited proprietary
“Melachol,” which has been frequently imitated. A preparation essentially
identical is in the United States Pharmacopeia, under the title “Compound
Solution of Sodium Phosphate.”</p>

<p>The Uricsol Company calls its preparation</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the latest word in the treatment of Rheumatism and that allied group of ailments
which is caused by an excess of Uric Acid.”</p></div>

<p>Hay fever, bronchial asthma and neuritis are conditions in which it is
recommended. The claim is made that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Uricsol quickly controls Vasomotor Rhinitis and eliminates such conditions from the
system.” “In fact, it will correct <span class="lowercase smcap">FAULTY METABOLISM</span>.”</p></div>

<p>To a few practitioners of an older generation the pharmacologic basis of
a remedy for rheumatism was sufficiently defined by saying that it increased
the solubility of uric acid or affected it in some way. This theory is obsolete;
there is not, and never was, any reliable evidence on which to base the theory
that rheumatism is in any way caused by uric acid. The exploitation of Uricsol
as a “uric acid solvent” is merely another illustration of the way in which
nostrum manufacturers play on disproved theories. Of course the claim that
sodium phosphate has any particular power to control vasomotor rhinitis, hay
fever, asthma, and to correct faulty metabolism is foolish.</p>

<p>To summarize: Uricsol is a mixture of well-known drugs, marketed with
false claims as to therapeutic action, with misleading and meaningless statements
as to composition and under a name which invites uncritical prescribing.
Uricsol is held ineligible to inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies.</p>


<h4>Jubol</h4>

<p>The following ridiculous statements are addressed, not to the laity, but to
the medical profession:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>DO YOU SUFFER FROM Constipation&mdash;&#8203;Hemorrhoids&mdash;&#8203;Enteritis&mdash;&#8203;Mucous discharge&mdash;&#8203;Pituita&mdash;&#8203;Acidity
of the stomach&mdash;&#8203;Vertigo&mdash;&#8203;Sick Headache&mdash;Disturbed Sleep&mdash;&#8203;Insomnia&mdash;&#8203;Sallow
Complexion&mdash;&#8203;Coated Tongue&mdash;&#8203;Offensive breath&mdash;&#8203;Fatigue and depression&mdash;&#8203;Boils&mdash;&#8203;Pimples?</p>

<p>“ONE of these symptoms alone shows that there is defective or insufficient function of
the intestines, even if the stools are regular.</p>

<p>“Excrements remain too long in the intestine and set up fermentation. The harmful poisons
and Ptomains which they produce are re-absorbed by the blood and poison the whole
system.</p>

<p>“The Intestines must be cleared and re-educated with JUBOL.</p>

<p>“Jubolise your Intestines.”</p></div>

<p>Jubol tablets are sold in the United States by Geo. J. Wallau, Inc., New
York, and are said to be prepared by J.&nbsp;L. Chatelain, Paris, France. The
following incomplete and nonquantitative “formula” is furnished:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. compounded chiefly [!] of Agar-Agar, Biliary Extracts and pure Extracts from
all the intestinal Glands.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span></p>
<p>It is asserted that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The tablets are coated with a protective covering in order that they may act on the
intestine only.”</p></div>

<p>The tablets contained in a regular-size trade package, obtained direct from
the agent, readily separated into two halves and disintegrated within a few
minutes when agitated with water. It is thus evident that, under ordinary
conditions, the intestinal ferments in Jubol (if they are present, as claimed)
would be destroyed during their passage through the stomach. In direct tests,
however, practically no tryptic activity was demonstrated.</p>

<p>The composition of Jubol is not declared; grossly unwarranted and incorrect
claims are made for its therapeutic actions; the name does not indicate the
alleged ingredients and so much of the composition as is declared indicates an
unscientific mixture. The Council decided that Jubol should be held ineligible
for New and Non­official Remedies, and that this report should be published.</p>


<h4>Urodonal</h4>

<p>Urodonal is said to be “produced in the laboratory of J.&nbsp;L. Chatelain,”
Paris, France. It is marketed in this country by Geo. J. Wallau, Inc., New
York.</p>

<p>The preparation is claimed to be a chemical compound, and the advertising
matter furnishes a “formula,” which consists of the formulas of lysidin, sidonal
and hexa­methylen­amin, connected by plus signs:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/formula.jpg" width="470" height="48" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That the substance is a chemical compound is highly improbable, and no
evidence has been submitted to substantiate the claim. On the contrary, in
the following statement the phrase “based on” is a virtual admission that the
preparation is merely a mixture:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Urodonal <span class="ell">..</span>. is a granular effervescent preparation based on methyl­gly­ox­alidine
[Lysidine], quinate of di­ethylene-diamine [Sidonal] and hexa­methylene-tetramine [Formin,
urotropine].”</p></div>

<p>Mystery is added by the mention of undefined “special products” in the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact of combining these two salts [lysidin and sidonal] in Urodonal, in strictly
determined proportions and in the presence of special products, gives this preparation very
considerable power in dissolving uric acid.”</p></div>

<p>These contradictory statements of composition conflict with Rule 1.</p>

<p>Urodonal is marketed in typical “patent medicine” style: the name “Urodonal”
is blown in the bottle and the label contains a list of “Indications,”
including rheumatism, gout and gravel (Rule 4). That this form of marketing
has introduced it to the public is suggested by the following in an advertising
circular:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Urodonal is now popular&mdash;even classic&mdash;throughout the world, where thousands
of doctors and millions of patients agree in asserting that ‘Urodonal is to rheumatism what
quinine is to fever.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>There are also other indications that the mixture is to be exploited to the
laity. For instance, the U.&nbsp;S. distributor sends out a portrait of Sarah Bernhardt
bearing the legend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am positive that URODONAL preserves youth’s freshness with clearness and strength
to brain and heart. I have taken it for two years with the greatest benefit. Sarah Bernhardt.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></p>
<p>A circular advises this mixture</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For all who suffer from Arthritis, Rheumatism, Arterio-Sclerosis, Renal and Bilious
Lithiasis, Headache, Gout, Gravel, Lumbago, Sciatic Pains, Neuralgia and all uric acid
troubles.”</p>

<p>“In fact, Urodonal is five times more active than piperazine, and thirty-seven times more
active than lithia. We are, therefore, entitled to say that no other eliminator of uric acid
can be compared with it.”</p>

<p>“Being <i>37 times more active than lithia</i>, it clears the heart valves of any sandy substances
which may clog them, and checks the atheromatous degeneration of the blood vessels.”</p></div>

<p>These extracts indicate sufficiently the extravagant tone of the advertising
(Rule 6): None of the ingredients are notably active in dissolving uric acid
when administered by mouth. None produce any marked increase of uric
acid elimination. No intelligent physician would use a uric acid solvent for
“bilious lithiasis”; and their usefulness in the other conditions is open to
doubt, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>Although the preparation is a simple mixture, the name does not indicate
the components, but inclines to therapeutic suggestion (Rule 8).</p>

<p>Nothing is to be gained by combining several drugs which are useless,
severally, for the purpose intended, as in the present case (Rule 10).</p>

<p>Urodonal is marketed under inconsistent statements of composition and
with exaggerated therapeutic claims; the name is nondescriptive and the mixture
is unscientific. The Council decided that the preparation should be
declared ineligible for conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6, 8 and 10 and that this report
should be published.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 14, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>FORMAMINT</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Formamint is a proprietary medicine manufactured by the A. Wulfing Company
(New York, London and Berlin), which is affiliated with the Bauer
Chemical Company.</p>

<p>It has been widely advertised in Europe for several years, and is now on
the American market<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> it is advertised in this country both in newspapers
and medical journals.</p>

<p>Following is a brief review of the more important alleged investigations
that have been reported from time to time in various European journals.</p>

<p>In “The Therapeutical Value of Foramint in Septic Affections of the Oro-Pharynx,”
De <span class="nowrap">Santi<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> quotes Rosenberg<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> who reports the successful use of
Formamint in cases of strepto­coccus infections, tonsillitis and acute symptoms of
chronic sore throat. According to Seifert<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> Formamint is a chemical combination
of formaldehyd and milk sugar. When the tablets are dissolved in the
saliva, 0.01 per cent. of formaldehyd in its “status nascendi” is liberated and
exercises a strong disinfectant action. Seifert states that the preparation is
markedly palatable, since it contains a little citric acid to render the taste
cool and refreshing. In some experiments with streptococci, pneumococci,
typhoid and diphtheria bacilli, Seifert found that a solution of one tablet in
10&nbsp;c.c. of water destroyed these germs in from five to ten minutes. A solution
of the same strength was also added to culture tubes of broth, agar, and gelatin,
with the result that no growth occurred in them, while distinct and characteristic
<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>development of the bacteria took place in control tubes. He does not
state, however, how much Formamint solution was added to the mediums.</p>

<p>Daus<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">18</a> reports successful treatment of tonsillitis, mumps and middle ear
diseases. In these cases no other gargles or mouth washes were used. He
states that no indication of irritant or other injurious action made its appearance
even after large doses. In the same article, F. Levy reports experiments
as follows: Agar plates were prepared with a culture of strepto­coccus from
a severe case of quinsy. One half of the plate was rubbed with saliva containing
Formamint in solution. (The strength of the solution used is not
given.) In twenty-four hours streaks of growth had appeared on one portion
of the plates while the part on which the Formamint saliva had been rubbed
remained sterile. Daus also found that agar and broth cultures of strepto­coccus
shaken with Formamint saliva remained sterile.</p>

<p>Rheinboldt,<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">19</a> investigating the effects of Formamint and of ordinary formaldehyd
on animals, concludes that formaldehyd is toxic in action while Formamint
is not.</p>

</div>

<p>Rosenberg<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">20</a> corroborates this statement. He also found that agar plates
of <i>Bacillus prodigiosus</i> were killed by Formamint solutions in about four hours.
He fails, however, to give the strength of his Formamint solutions.</p>

<p>Wingrave<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">21</a> suggests the use of Formamint for infants! He recommends that
a tablet be crushed and wrapped in “butter cloth.” The ends of the cloth are
to be tied with thread, the Formamint is to be moistened, and the packet is to
be held in the mouth of the baby several times each day.</p>

<p>Young<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">22</a> published the results of some experiments by himself and Delépine
on the human throat. They dissolved a tablet in the mouth and made swab
cultures with the following results:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="fs100" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">Immediately after taking the tablet</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;&#8199;0&nbsp;colonies</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">10 minutes after taking the tablet</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;35&nbsp;colonies</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">30 minutes after taking the tablet</span></div></td><td class="tar">150&nbsp;colonies</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>They found no staphylococci at any time. Other results of swabbing various
parts of the throat before and after the use of Formamint, reported by these
investigators, show enormous reductions in the count, claimed to be due to
the action of Formamint. The count was made on agar at 37&nbsp;C., but they fail
to state the time elapsing between taking the Formamint and making the swab.
<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>Young also reports favorable clinical results in cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria,
sore throat, and the like. It must be noted, however, that they state
that the mouth and fauces must first be thoroughly cleansed by swabbing and
douching before Formamint is used.</p>

<h5>THE “CHEMICAL COMPOUND” CLAIM</h5>

<p>The claims made in the advertising literature of Formamint are very
extravagant. Many are highly improbable. These statements will be discussed
later.</p>

<p>The statement is made that Formamint is a new chemical compound:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Formamint is Penta­methan­allactose, 5&nbsp;CHOH + C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. It is an original combination
of Formaldehyde with Lactose, a definite chemical compound. The Formaldehyde molecule is
locked up in it until solution in the saliva takes place, when the Formaldehyde is liberated in its
<i>nascent</i> state and is therefore active without being irritant.”</p></div>

<p>Furthermore the makers contend that this new chemical compound is
entirely harmless. For example, Daus<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> in an article on “The Disinfectant
Action of Formic Aldehyde on Mucous Membranes,” declares:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No indication of irritant or other injurious action made its appearance even after large
doses. The urine remained free from albumin and sugar.”</p></div>

<p>Such statements as these are found in the advertising literature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Formamint tablets are absolutely harmless and innocuous, even to little children.”</p>

<p>“When dissolved in the saliva, Formamint Tablets liberate slowly Nascent Formaldehyde
in a most active yet non-irritant form.”</p></div>

<p>They maintain that Formamint is not only absolutely harmless, but actually
beneficial to the tissues. It may be used “to tone up and strengthen the tissues,
prevent hoarseness, and allay irritation in singers, public speakers,” etc.</p>

<p>The claims urged as to its germicidal power are indeed glittering. This
“new chemical compound” is claimed to liberate formaldehyd in some new
and peculiar condition which, while it has a soothing and tonic effect on the
cells of the human tissues, can at the same time quickly kill any form of
bacterial life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dissolving readily, it releases its germicidal, antiseptic qualities, which impregnate the
saliva and are carried naturally and easily around the mouth and in the deepest crevices of
the throat&mdash;destroying the germs where they are causing the mischief. Formamint prevents
and destroys infectious germ life in a soothing grateful way.”</p>

<p>“In the saliva it frees a germicide, fatal to germs but harmless to the most delicate membranes.
And flowing into every tiny corner of the gums, tonsils and throat, into places where
no gargle ever reaches, it most effectively <i>disinfects</i> the throat.”</p></div>

<p>The claims as to the preventive and curative effects of the preparation
cover a large portion of the category of human ailments and distresses. The
following quotations indicate some of its supposed properties:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it is therefore self-evident that Formamint should be looked upon as a necessary
part of the treatment of all forms of tonsillitis.”</p>

<p>“The value of Formamint is equally great in diphtheric tonsillitis, or as a prophylactic&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“The extraordinary success which I had with Formamint in a school epidemic of scarlet
fever during May and June, 1907, was the determining factor which induced me to abandon
the use of inhalations, gargles, local applications in the treatment of diseases of the throat,
and to use Formamint exclusively for the future.”</p>

<p>“There are naturally many similar conditions in which Formamint may be used as a
prophylactic, notably scarlet fever, mumps, strepto­coccal and staphylo­coccal sore throats, ‘milk
outbreaks’ of sore throat, drain throats, hospital throats, and the like.”</p>

<p>“Formamint Tablets are indicated in Angina, Tonsillitis, Pharyngitis, Stomatitis, Gingivitis,
Glossitis, ulceration, spongy or bleeding gums, Pyorrhea Alveolaris, ‘Smoker’s Sore
Throat,’ Abscess or Boils, etc.”</p>

<p>“As a <i>Prophylactic</i> against Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Influenza, Measles, Epidemic poliomyelitis,
and other pathogenic micro-organisms. To neutralize putrefaction products in and
about the teeth, correct fermentative processes, deodorize and purify the breath, etc.”</p>

<p>“To <i>tone up</i>, and <i>strengthen</i> the tissues, prevent <i>hoarseness</i> and <i>allay irritation</i> in singers,
public speakers, neutralize the effects of dust-infection or <i>disinfect the saliva or sputum</i> in
Influenza, Tuberculosis, etc.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span></p>
<p>One man declares that along with specific constitutional treatment he “had
the best results from the use of Formamint tablets” in a case of syphilitic
ulceration of the tongue.</p>

<p>In short, Formamint is recommended for the treatment or prevention of
almost everything, from a bad breath to such grave conditions as scarlet fever,
diphtheria and tuberculosis, conditions in which a delay in proper treatment&mdash;for
instance, in diphtheria, a failure to administer antitoxin&mdash;may result in
the death of the patient.</p>

<p>A series of investigations was therefore undertaken in order to discover
whether the extravagant claims regarding the germicidal power of Formamint
could be verified.</p>


<h4>Experimental Data</h4>

<p>Two fifty-cent bottles of Wulfing’s Formamint were purchased in the open
market and were kept well stoppered to prevent deterioration.</p>

<p>Qualitative tests showed the presence of formaldehyd and the amount was
determined quantitatively by the hydrogen peroxid method as given by Sutton<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>
The results were respectively, 1.99 per cent. and 2.03 per cent. of formaldehyd.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/036.jpg" width="430" height="185" alt="" />
<div>Two Formamint advertisements reproduced in miniature typical of those appearing in a
certain type of medical journals.</div>
</div>

<p>Some determinations were made of the germicidal power of Formamint in
vitro, that is, under controlled laboratory conditions. A twenty-four-hour
plain agar culture of <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i> was washed off in 10&nbsp;c.c. of sterile
0.85 per cent. sodium chlorid solution. A 1:100,000 dilution of this was made
in each of three flasks containing 100&nbsp;c.c. of sterile saliva. Flask 1 contained
1 per cent. of Formamint, Flask 2, 5 per cent.; Flask 3, containing no Formamint,
was kept as a control. At intervals samples were removed and dilutions
made and plated in duplicate on standard agar. The plates were incubated
twenty-four hours at 37&nbsp;C., and plates containing less than 200 colonies were
counted. The results are given in Table 1. After seven days there was no
appreciable difference in the plates.</p>

<p>* The last two observations were made at the same time as on the 1 per cent. solutions.</p>

<p>Another test was made by adding a 1 per cent. Formamint solution to plain
agar plates inoculated with <i>B. coli</i>. A twenty-four-hour plain agar culture of
<i>B. coli</i> was washed off in 10&nbsp;c.c. of sterile 0.85 per cent. sodium chlorid solution.
A 1:1,000,000 dilution was made of this and 1&nbsp;c.c. added to each plate. Varying
amounts of 1 per cent. solution of Formamint were added to each plate.
They were incubated seventy-two hours at 37&nbsp;C. After seven days’ incubation
the count was the same. The results are given in Table 2.</p>

<p>Another experiment was made thus: One loopful of a twenty-four-hour
plain agar culture of <i>Strepto­coccus lacticus</i> was mixed with a tube of North
medium. One loopful from the inoculated tube was mixed with a second tube
of North medium. Both tubes were poured into Petri dishes and allowed to
cool. One half of each plate was well smeared with a 10 per cent. solution of
<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>Formamint in saliva. After twenty-four hours’ incubation at 37&nbsp;C., only a few
colonies appeared on the side to which the Formamint had been applied, while
the other half was thickly covered with colonies.</p>

<p>This work so far corroborates that reported in the literature quoted by the
manufacturers. But the fact that a compound is a germicide when brought
into intimate contact with bacteria in a solution or medium in a test tube or
flask does not prove that it will be effective when used in the human throat.</p>


<h5>THE ALLEGED GERMICIDAL ACTION</h5>

<p>An attempt was made to discover whether or not the claims advanced by the
manufacturers as to the perfect germicidal action of Formamint in all the
nooks and crannies of the mouth and throat could be confirmed.</p>

<p>The first step in attacking this problem was to make comparative counts
of the number of bacteria in the throat before and after the use of Formamint.
The methods employed were as follows: The throat was gargled with 50&nbsp;c.c.
of sterile 0.85 per cent. sodium chlorid solution. In each case the same length
of time, as far as possible, was used in the process. The liquid was collected
in a sterile flask. The gargling in a series of experiments was begun not less
than two hours after a meal. After some preliminary work the following dilutions
of the 50&nbsp;c.c. of salt solution were found sufficient: 1:1,000, 1:10,000
and 1:100,000. Plates were made in duplicate from each dilution and
incubated seventy-two hours at 37&nbsp;C. The counts were made on plates
containing less than 200 colonies. Except where otherwise noted standard
agar was used. The mediums were always prepared in the same way.</p>

<p>All the work was carried out under conditions as nearly natural as possible.
The Formamint was taken according to the directions accompanying the trade
package. Every opportunity was given the Formamint to penetrate all the
crypts and recesses about the mouth and throat. The tablet was allowed to
dissolve as slowly as possible, the time usually being five to six minutes, and
saliva was thoroughly forced around the mouth before being swallowed.
Plating was always done immediately after gargling so that no growth could
occur in the salt solution. The results are given in Table 3. The numbers
are average counts from several plates and calculated to show the number of
bacteria washed out by the 50&nbsp;c.c. of salt solution.</p>

<p>Finally a determination was made of the number of streptococci in the throat
before and after the use of Formamint. The throat was gargled in the manner
previously described. The strepto­coccus count was made by the dilution method
as given by Heinemann<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> Culture tubes were used instead of fermentation
tubes. One per cent. dextrose broth was the medium employed. One cubic
centimeter was added to each of a series of ten tubes for each dilution and
the following dilutions were used: 1:10,000, 1:100,000 and 1:1,000,000.</p>

<p>The results given in Table 4 are the average count from a number of dilutions

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The contention that Formamint contains formaldehyd was confirmed by
analysis.</p>

<p>The manufacturers also maintain that Formamint is a new, definite chemical
compound, consisting of five molecules of formaldehyd and one molecule of
lactose, and that when dissolved in the saliva the formaldehyd is liberated in
some new and peculiar form, which they call nascent formaldehyd. This new
kind of formaldehyd is, according to the advertising literature, especially
powerful in its germicidal properties and at the same time has absolutely no
irritating or harmful effects.</p>


<h5>NOT A CHEMICAL COMPOUND</h5>

<p>Thoms,<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">25</a> retained as an expert by the German government, decided, after a
series of chemical investigations, that Formamint was not a definite chemical
compound, but that it was probably a solid solution of formaldehyd in lactose.
He proved that when the process of manufacture was carried out in exactly
the way called for by the Formamint patents, compounds containing a greater
or less per cent. of formaldehyd could be made while the other properties
remained similar to those of Formamint. The composition of the final product
depended on the proportion of the components used in the process. Therefore
Formamint did not form a safe means of uniform dosage.</p>

<p>As a result of Thoms’ work the German courts held that Formamint was
not a new chemical compound. Consequently the Formamint patent (Number
189036) was annulled in Berlin, Nov. 29, 1913.</p>

<p>Again the contention that formaldehyd in the nascent or active condition
is less poisonous and irritating than in its ordinary form is contrary to what
would be expected from the behavior of such compounds. If it were liberated,
as claimed, in the “nascent” condition, it would be, for that very reason, not
only more active but also more harmful.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Formamint did have an irritant effect on the worker
who carried out these investigations. When one tablet was taken each hour
for twelve consecutive hours, marked irritation of the intestinal tract resulted.
There was almost sufficient nausea to cause vomiting and uneasiness in the
alimentary canal following the experiment. When the twenty-four tablets
were taken the results were similar but more pronounced. This is decidedly
in contradiction to the assertions of the manufacturers.</p>

<p>Otto Seifert,<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">26</a> moreover, cites the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By Effects: Only a few patients complain of an unpleasant sharp taste, burning of the
tongue (Seifert, Sklarek). Among the general symptoms observed are urticaria-like exanthems
(Glaser, Roters), which are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia and
vertigo, burning and irritability especially in the larynx (Meissner); phenomena of poisoning
(Geissler); gastric disturbances (Engelmann); renal irritation (Steinhard); unsuited for
diabetics (Voit).”</p></div>

<p>The contention that Formamint, when mixed directly with mediums and left
in contact with bacteria, will kill the organisms was corroborated. Thus the
statements and pictures in the booklet, “The Gospel of Prevention,” which is
enclosed with each bottle of Formamint, showing the inhibition of growth of
air bacteria on plates containing Formamint are no doubt true and authentic.</p>

<p>Finally, the claim that Formamint is an almost perfect throat disinfectant
was by no means confirmed, as a glance at the tables will show. One hour
after it is taken, even when a tablet was used each half hour for twelve hours,
the number of bacteria in the throat was practically the same as when Formamint
was not used. Even ten minutes after taking a tablet the number of
bacteria in the throat was never greatly reduced, as is maintained by the
manufacturers.</p>


<h5>HAS NO SELECTIVE ACTION</h5>

<p>Formamint exerts no selective action in killing off the very delicate
organisms which are more apt to be pathogenic. When the comparative
counts were made on blood agar which would favor the growth of the delicate
parasitic organisms, no reduction whatever was shown by the use of
Formamint.</p>

<p>The number of streptococci was found to be the same, within limits of
experimental error, ten minutes after taking a tablet as it was before the
tablet was taken.</p>

<p>Therefore it seems that Formamint fails, as any such germicide would be
expected to fail, to kill bacteria in the crypts and recesses of the throat, for
when dissolved in the mouth it cannot reach and remain in contact with the
organisms long enough to kill them before it is swallowed.</p>


<h5>SUMMARY</h5>

<p>Summed up, the investigation shows:</p>

<p>1. That the claims made for Formamint are extravagant and misleading.</p>

<p>2. That the recommendations for the use of these tablets may be, in some
cases, fraught with danger and are a menace, not only to the health of the
individual, but also to the safety of the community.</p>

<p>3. That the claim that Formamint is a definite chemical compound is false.</p>

<p>4. That the use of Formamint may produce marked irritation of the intestinal
tract.</p>

<p>5. That Formamint is not a throat disinfectant, as the manufacturers maintain,
but its action on the bacteria of the throat is an almost negligible one
and dependence on Formamint for the prevention of infection and for curing
disease is not only unwise but dangerous.</p>

<p>6. That Formamint conflicts with the rules of the Council. False statements
are made with regard to its composition (Rule 1); grossly unwarranted
<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>claims are made for its therapeutic properties (Rule 6), and therefore its
exploitation to the public (Rules 3 and 4) is a public danger.</p>

<p>It is recommended that this report be published, to call attention not only
to the falsity of the claims made for, and the danger in the use of, Formamint,
but also to emphasize the utter inefficiency of all such methods of “disinfecting”
the throat.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 28, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>HYDRAGOGIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Hydragogin (C. Bischoff &amp; Co., New York, selling agents) is advertised as
“a most powerful diuretic and cardiac tonic.” The composition given is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fifteen parts of the remedy contain 0.5 parts oxysaponin, 1.5 parts tincture of digitalis,
2.5 parts tincture of strophanthus, scillipicrin and scillitoxin, the active principles of scilla
maritima, and alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>It is not clear from this statement whether 15 parts of Hydragogin contain
2.5 parts of tincture of strophanthus, plus unspecified amounts of scillipicrin and
scillitoxin, or 2.5 parts of a mixture, in unspecified proportions, of tincture of
strophanthus, scillipicrin and scillitoxin. The activity of strophanthus, after it
enters the blood stream, is about fifty times that of digitalis; hence, if the
former proportion is the true one, in giving an amount of Hydragogin which
ensures the full therapeutic effect of the digitalis, one would administer an
almost certainly fatal amount of strophanthus. Whatever the proportion of
strophanthus may be, however, the administration of a mixture of digitalis and
strophanthus in fixed proportions is indefensible. At times it is advisable to
follow one of these drugs with the other in the treatment of cardiac disease.
The simultaneous administration of the two continuously in fixed proportions,
however, is injudicious, because of the great difference between their rates of
absorption and in their activity after they enter the blood stream. The action
of digitalis, moreover, persists much longer than does that of strophanthus.</p>

<p>An advertising circular contains the following claim:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The well-known diuretic properties of digitalis, strophanthus and squills are greatly
enhanced by the addition of the oxysaponin.”</p></div>

<p>This is not true. Saponins are not synergistic with digitalis thera­peutically;
on the contrary, they exert a purely deleterious action on the heart when they
enter the circulation.</p>

<p>The symptoms of cardiac disease are often difficult to distinguish from the
toxic actions of the digitalis bodies. Since these bodies must often be given to
the point of beginning toxic action in order to induce the full therapeutic
effects, it is obvious that the administration of a mixture of digitalis, strophanthus,
saponin and active principles of squill is especially liable to induce
serious toxic effects which cannot be distinguished from the symptoms of the
disease.</p>

<p>Hydragogin is a shotgun mixture of semisecret composition; it is marketed
under a thera­peutically suggestive name, and advertised by means of unwarranted
therapeutic claims. It is therefore in conflict with Rules 1, 6, 8 and 10.
The Council held Hydragogin ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>FILUDINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Filudine is said to be prepared by J.&nbsp;L. Chatelain, Paris, and is sold in
this country by Geo. J. Wallau, Inc., New York. It is offered as a remedy
<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>for “biliary insufficiency,” “hepatic insufficiency,” “intestinal dyspepsia,” “all
affections of the liver (diabetes, cirrhosis, cancer, etc.),” “malaria,” “obesity”
and “tuberculosis.”</p>

<p>No quantitative information is furnished as to the composition of the
preparation and there are noteworthy discrepancies in the various statements
regarding the ingredients. In one number of “Treatment,” a self-styled
“Review” of medical literature (actually devoted to advertising the preparations
sold by Wallau), we are told that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This product [Filudine] is a more concentrated and potent extract of the liver, with
which is combined an extract of the spleen. The liver and the spleen are so intimately interdependent,
that the addition of a splenary extract to the liver extract is a signal improvement
from which a synergistic action results. Thiarféine is also added, as it helps somewhat
to combat the anaemia from which all diabetics suffer more or less.”</p></div>

<p>Thiarféine is said to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thiomethylarsinate of Caffein, a new salt discovered by M. Chatelain.”</p></div>

<p>Another circular, which gives an imposing formula for “thiarféine” or
“thio­methyl­arsinate of caffein,” states that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sulphurated methylarsinate is an arsenical preparation devoid of all toxicity on account
of the intimate joining of its composing parts.”</p></div>

<p>And that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Filudine can never be contraindicated.”</p></div>

<p>A statement of composition in a later number of “Treatment,” however, says
that biliary extracts are components, in addition to the liver and spleen extracts.
Moreover, thiarféine, the “new salt discovered by M. Chatelain,” is no longer
“thio­methyl­arsinate,” but “thio­cinnamate of caffein”; and a new formula is
furnished for it.</p>

<p>We are told that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Methyl-arsinate cannot be used in cases where fever is present<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>“M. Chatelain at first studied the action of thio­methyl­arsinate; clinical and physiological
experimentation led him, however, to adopt thio­cinnamate of caffein, of greater activity and
with no contraindications.”</p></div>

<p>Nevertheless the same absence of contraindications was urged in favor of
Filudine when it was said to contain the now discarded thio­methyl­arsinate of
caffein.</p>

<p>The following are some of the unwarranted and even absurd claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Filudine restores the liver’s functions. It is to the liver what digitalis is to the heart;
it overcomes the insufficiency and stimulates the debilitated organ.”</p>

<p>In malaria “it is the only true specific when associated with quinine.”</p>

<p>“Filudine is <span class="ell">..</span>. the ideal medication for tuberculosis, conforming as it does with the
most recent researches in the therapeusis of this affection.”</p>

<p>“We will not go as far as to say that Opotherapy <i>completely restores</i> unhealthy livers, for
although the lesions of the hepatic parenchyma may be obliterated by regeneration, the lesions
of the connective tissues are permanent, and may be observed at the postmortem examination.
The new cells, however, do not present the same unhealthy conditions as those of the former
diseased gland which they have replaced, and the liver can therefore function normally, so
that the patient lives on; and he is satisfied with that.”</p>

<p>“Therefore, while regenerating the liver with Filudine, we cleanse it and combat its congested
state with Urodonal. We cause it to produce urea from the excess of uric acid which
it contains.”</p>

<p>“By the judicious and harmonious combination of the beneficial effects of Filudine and
Urodonal, physicians not only possess the means of treating by rational methods Cirrhosis of
the Liver in its various forms (which is one of the most terrible diseases which can afflict
anyone) but what is still better, <i>they can cure it</i>.”</p>

<p>“The liver of a person suffering from obesity being incapable of fulfilling its functions in
regard to the fatty tissues, the rational and up-to-date method of treatment is therefore to
restore to the system, in the form of Filudine, the liver extracts which are lacking.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span></p>
<p>Filudine is a mixture of semisecret composition. The therapeutic claims
are manifestly unwarranted. The name is not indicative of the composition,
whatever that may be, and no rational excuse is offered for the combination
of liver and spleen extracts (with or without bile extracts) with “thio­methyl­arsinate”
or “thiocinnamate” of caffein.</p>

<p>The Council therefore held Filudine ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 18, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>LACTOPEPTINE AND ELIXIR LACTOPEPTINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Mixtures of pepsin and pancreatin are thera­peutically irrational; the two
substances are not indicated in the same conditions, nor can they act together.
Under physiologic conditions, such mixtures are chemically impossible: in a
liquid medium the ingredients destroy each other.</p>

<p>Lactopeptin is manufactured by the New York Pharmacal Association,
Yonkers, N.&nbsp;Y. It is sold under the claim that it contains, pepsin, diastase,
pancreatin, lactic acid and hydrochloric acid. This product was among the
first proprietary preparations examined by the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry. The report of the investigation was published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
March 16, 1907, p.&nbsp;959. The preparation was found to be practically inert&mdash;“essentially
a weak saccharated pepsin,” devoid of tryptic activity.</p>

<p>Six years later it was still widely advertised with the same irrational
claims. A referee (A) therefore examined Lactopeptine (powdered) for the
Council in 1913, and confirmed the previous findings. The referee’s report was
published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 2, 1913, p.&nbsp;358.</p>

<p>Nearly four months after this publication, the manufacturer protested
against the report, maintaining, contrary to the findings of the Council, that
Lactopeptine possesses pancreatic activity and contains “loosely combined”
hydrochloric acid. Referee A therefore repeated his examination, and a second
referee (B), independently, examined specimens of Lactopeptine (powder)
purchased on the open market for the purpose shortly before.</p>

<p>A few specimens examined by these two referees showed a slight tryptic
activity; most of them showed none. The amount of hydrochloric acid present
was insignificant.</p>

<p>The reports of the two referees were referred to the manufacturers, who
again protested vehemently against these findings, this time on the ground that
the specimens were old. The manufacturers also cited the work of three chemists
to disprove the findings of the referees, and demanded that the Council
reexamine Lactopeptine, making use of fresh specimens. The Council refused
for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. So long as the packages of Lactopeptine are not dated, the activity of
specimens known to be fresh is of no practical importance. The activity of the
actual market supply is the only question of interest to the profession. The
only fair test is that made on specimens representative of the product sold to
the ultimate consumer.</p>

<p>2. The evidence presented by the manufacturers did not warrant a reexamination,
since the work of two of the chemists cited substantially corroborates
the results obtained by the Council’s referees from the fresher specimens. The
figures for tryptic activity obtained by the third chemist cited by the manufacturers
could not be accepted by the Council, since it was at variance with all
other known results of investigations of Lactopeptine.</p>

<p>3. As stated at the outset, whatever the tryptic activity of the mixture, it is
thera­peutically useless. A demonstration of tryptic activity in a mixture containing
both pepsin and pancreatin is of merely theoretical interest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span></p>
<p>Such activity, of course, cannot be expected, even on theoretical grounds, in
liquid mixtures like Elixir Lactopeptine.</p>

<p>The Council therefore again declared Lactopeptine (powder and tablets) and
Elixir Lactopeptine ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies and authorized
publication of the following statement.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary</p>


<p class="tac"><i>THE COUNCIL’S REPORT</i></p>

<p>Lactopeptine powder (New York Pharmacal Association, Yonkers, N.&nbsp;Y.)
was examined by the Council in 1907. At that time it was claimed to contain</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the five active agents of digestion&mdash;pepsin, diastase (veg. ptyalin), pancreatin,
lactic acid and hydrochloric acid&mdash;combined in the proper proportion to insure the best results.”</p></div>

<p>The examination showed that the preparation was essentially “a weak
saccharated pepsin,” containing but small amounts of pepsin, no hydrochloric
acid, or mere traces only, and no diastase or pancreatin (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, March
16, 1907).</p>

<p>In 1913, the product was reexamined, because the claims, as to both composition
and therapeutic value, were still being made. Samples were tested
both of the American product, and of a British product from John Morgan
Richards &amp; Sons, London. The original findings were confirmed and the
results were published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 2, 1913, p.&nbsp;358. Nearly four months
later (November 24) the New York Pharmacal Association wrote to the Council,
objecting to the findings and maintaining that Lactopeptine possesses
pancreatic activity and contains (“in loose chemical combination”) hydrochloric
acid. In accordance with the custom of the Council, the work was sent back
for review to the referee (A), whose conclusions were then tested by a second
referee (B), a physiologic chemist, not a member of the Council, selected
because of his special knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>In December, 1913, Referee A made a large number of new tests to determine
proteolytic and amylolytic power. His results show that the ferment activity
of the preparation is so low as to merit no recognition in practical use. The
tests also show that the amount of lactic acid or “loosely combined HCl” (or
both) present is too small to have any appreciable physiologic activity and
therefore to be of any therapeutic value.</p>

<p>Nine samples of Lactopeptine purchased in the open market in December,
1913, and January, 1914, were examined by Referee B early in 1914. His studies
show absence of amylase in all samples; presence of pepsin, giving weak
reactions even when compared with those of old pepsin preparations; complete
absence of trypsin in seven out of nine samples, tryptic reaction being obtained
in two samples, in one of which the reaction, “slight at best and of no practical
import,” was obtained only after treatment for twelve hours or more.</p>

<p>The presence of tryptic activity in two out of the nine samples may be due
to the fresher condition of these specimens, as indicated by the serial numbers.
The evidence shows that it is a commercial impossibility to market mixtures
of pepsin, pancreatin and lactic acid so that they can display any material
tryptic activity.</p>

<p>It should be reaffirmed that mixtures combining peptic and pancreatic
activities are not feasible, because pepsin cannot act except in the presence of
acid, and pancreatin is destroyed by acid and by peptic activity. Furthermore,
in conditions in which pancreatin is called for, pepsin is not, and vice versa;
therefore the administration of mixtures of pepsin and pancreatin would be
unjustified, even if both constituents could be expected to exert activity.</p>

<p>The foregoing observations apply to Lactopeptine in powder and tablet
form.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span></p>
<p>While mixtures of pepsin and pancreatin are unscientific and unjustified,
theoretically the two substances may coexist in a solid preparation, and the
activity of such a preparation is consequently a proper subject of investigation.
Theoretically as well as practically, however, pepsin and pancreatin cannot
exist together in solution. The claims made for Elixir Lactopeptine and all
other liquid preparations sold as mixtures of pepsin and pancreatin are therefore
impossible. The Council has previously taken action (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
Feb. 2, 1907, p.&nbsp;434) refusing to approve for inclusion with New and Non­official
Remedies such preparations, calling the attention of the medical profession
and of manufacturers to their worthlessness, and requesting the American
Pharmaceutical Association to instruct its committee on the National Formulary
to omit from the next edition of that work a liquid preparation of pepsin and
pancreatin recognized under the title of “elixir digestivum compositum.”</p>

<p>It is recommended that the Council reaffirm this previous action, and that
Lactopeptine and Elixir Lactopeptine be declared ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies because of conflict with Rule 10 (“No article will be admitted
which, because of its unscientific composition, is useless or inimical to the
best interests of the public or of the medical profession”).</p>


<h4>Manufacturers’ Protest and Council’s Answer</h4>

<p>The foregoing was submitted, together with the findings of the two referees,
to the manufacturers. They protested again, alleging that:</p>


<h5>AGE OF SPECIMENS</h5>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;The specimens of Lactopeptine examined by the second referee were
old. The dates of manufacture corresponding to the several batch numbers
are supplied by the manufacturers as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">1638 (Tablets)</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">October, 1911</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The manufacturers assert that they do not understand how specimens of
these ages could have been purchased on the open market in 1913 and 1914,
inasmuch as their agents are and long have been instructed to take up from
the druggist all lots of Lactopeptine which, as indicated by the batch numbers,
have attained “any appreciable age.” The age of the specimens, the manufacturers
declare, deprives the table in the second referee’s report of “all
significance or interest.”</p>

<p>As previously stated, however, the specimens of Lactopeptine examined
were purchased on the open market in various localities in unbroken packages,
in December, 1913, and January, 1914. They thus represent stock used in filling
physicians’ prescriptions or sold to the public. Neither the referees nor any
one connected with the Council had any means of knowing the age of the
specimens until the dates of manufacture were furnished by the New York
Pharmacal Association. The first tests of the second referee were made in
February, 1914, on Specimens 2374 and 2383, which were then, it would appear,
about one year old and four months old, respectively. The Council has repeatedly
urged that pharmaceutical substances which are subject to deterioration
should be dated by the manufacturer, and a similar suggestion has been made
by the Bureau of Chemistry of the U.&nbsp;S. Department of Agriculture concerning
mixtures containing enzymes. Notwithstanding the instructions which the
New York Pharmacal Association claims to have given its agents, the market
<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>supply of Lactopeptine in December, 1913, and January, 1914, was not composed
of new stock, and until the manufacturers adopt the practice of dating
packages, there can be no assurance that it will be fresh. In this connection,
it is of interest to note that the Bureau of Chemistry of the U.&nbsp;S. Department
of Agriculture has issued a warning that it will judge such products by the
degree of their activity when they reach the consumer, i.&nbsp;e., as they are found
on the market.</p>


<h5>REPORTS OF OTHER CHEMISTS</h5>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;The New York Pharmacal Association cites the work of several
chemists, who have examined Lactopeptine and report the presence of tryptic
activity. Dr. S.&nbsp;R. Benedict in December, 1913, reported to the Council “distinct”
tryptic activity (digestion in twelve hours by Lactopeptine of 4.2 times
its weight of fibrin containing 50 per cent. moisture) in specimens examined
by him. These specimens were numbered 2382, and were therefore probably
manufactured in October, 1913; compare the dates furnished by the manufacturer
for the specimens used by the second referee. No tests against other
preparations possessing tryptic activity are reported, and Dr. Benedict expressly
disclaims any opinion as to the therapeutic value of the preparation<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> Dr. P.&nbsp;B.
Hawk, whose report was submitted by the manufacturers, found in Lactopeptine
by Fermi’s method one-fifth tryptic activity of that of Merck’s pancreatin,
and by Grützner’s method an activity of 18 per cent. of the pancreatin.
A test for the production of tryptophan was reported positive. The New York
Pharmacal Association also submitted a report from Dr. A.&nbsp;W. Balch, who
found pepsin, rennin, trypsin, steapsin, amylopsin and lactic acid present in
Lactopeptine; also an amount of combined hydrochloric acid in 1&nbsp;gm. the
equivalent of 1.05&nbsp;c.c. tenth normal solution or 0.00383&nbsp;gm. hydrochloric acid.
(He reports digestion in twenty-four hours by Lactopeptine of 25 times its own
weight of fibrin. “An active extract of pancreas reacted exactly like the Lactopeptine
solution.”) The serial numbers of the specimens tested by Hawk
and Balch are not given, but no doubt they were fresh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span></p>

<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>The New York Pharmacal Association demanded that the referee reexamine
Lactopeptine, making use of fresh specimens. The Council held that this was
unnecessary, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. The previous finding of the Council, that specimens of Lactopeptine found
on the open market are essentially weak saccharated pepsins, is not to be
refuted by examination of fresh specimens. Even if it be assumed that all old
specimens of Lactopeptine have been withdrawn from the market since the last
purchase of specimens for the use of the Council’s referee, there can be no
assurance that the stock will be constantly kept fresh. Unless the manufacturers
date their product, physicians cannot know that their prescriptions are
filled with fresh material. Nor is it reasonable to ask that the Council examine
the market supply of any given proprietary at a time selected by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>2. Without entering into all questions of detail in the analyses, the Council
is willing to accept the reports of Drs. Benedict and Hawk as representative
of fresh Lactopeptine powder. It is therefore unnecessary for the Council to
make further experiments along this line. The results of these two chemists
in no wise contradict the conclusions of the Council’s referees, being comparable
with those obtained by the referee on the fresher specimens used by
them. The experiments of Drs. Hawk and Benedict show a degree of tryptic
activity which, though chemically not negligible, is quite without significance
practically, even if it could be assumed that the trypsin in the fresh Lactopeptine
escaped destruction in the stomach. The figures for tryptic activity
given by Dr. Benedict do not differ materially from those of the first referee.
Those of Professor Hawk show a tryptic activity of from 18 to 20 per cent.
of that of commercial pancreatin&mdash;and commercial pancreatins ordinarily are
of low tryptic activity, if not inert (see Long and Muhleman: <i>Arch. Int. Med.</i>,
February, 1914, p.&nbsp;314.) The reports of these chemists present no reason for
changing the conclusion that “it is a commercial impossibility to market mixtures
of pepsin, pancreatin and lactic acid so that they can display any material
tryptic activity.”</p>

<p>The results which Dr. Balch obtained in a test for tryptic activity show a
marked discrepancy with those obtained by Drs. Hawk and Benedict, not to
mention the Council’s referees, and also with the fact that only about 11 per
cent. of “pancreatin” is claimed in the published formula of Lactopeptine. The
Council is unable to accept Dr. Balch’s result for trypsin or rennin as reliable.
His other results are without significance and call for no special comment.</p>

<p>3. Even if tryptic activity were conceded to Lactopeptine, the preparation,
like all preparations containing pepsin and pancreatin, would still be, as previously
stated, thera­peutically irrational.</p>

<p>The Council approved the report.</p>


<h4>Report of Referee A</h4>

<p>In view of the manufacturer’s reiteration of the claims for Lactopeptine
powder, I have carried out further experiments to determine its proteolytic
and amylolytic power.</p>

<p>For the proteolytic test I used fresh, well washed fibrin and examined
samples of Lactopeptine powder numbered as follows:</p>

<p>No. 1. A part of the English product examined and reported on last spring.</p>

<p>No. 2. A fresh bottle obtained at a Chicago retail drug store in December,
1913.</p>

<p>No. 3. A fresh bottle obtained at a Chicago retail store in December, 1913.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span></p>
<p>Portions of 1&nbsp;gm. each of these samples were mixed with 5&nbsp;gm. fibrin, 100&nbsp;mg.
of sodium carbonate and 50&nbsp;c.c. of water in flasks. A little toluene was
added to each flask, which was then closed with a tuft of cotton and the mixtures
were incubated at 40 degrees through twenty-four hours. At the end
of that time there was no marked change in the quantity of the fibrin remaining
in each flask, the larger part by far being undigested.</p>

<p>As a control I used the sample of an active commercial trypsin, of which
I added 500&nbsp;mg. to the same quantity of water, fibrin and sodium carbonate.
This was digested in the same bath at the same time. The digestion was
practically completed in less than ten minutes, only minute flakes of the fibrin
remaining.</p>

<p>It is evident that the digestive power of the Lactopeptine must be extremely
low, and only a small fraction of that exhibited by a commercially good trypsin.</p>

<p>In an experiment with the English sample carried out through nineteen
hours as above, using 2&nbsp;gm. of fibrin and 100&nbsp;mg. of ferment, it was found by
nitrogen tests on the filtrate that about 12.2 per cent. of the protein had been
brought into solution, an amount which is practically without importance in
a digestion of such duration.</p>

<p>To test the starch digestive power I have made a large number of experiments.
In a series just completed I mixed 1&nbsp;gm. portions of Samples 1 and 2
with water to make 100&nbsp;c.c. volumes. Before making up to the final volumes
0.5&nbsp;c.c. of normal sodium hydroxid was added to neutralize the slight acidity
of the ferment as shown by phenolphthalein.</p>

<p>Of these mixtures 4, 6, 8 and 10&nbsp;c.c. portions were mixed with 50&nbsp;c.c. of 1
per cent. starch paste and incubated at 40 degrees to find the colorless end-point
in the starch digestion, by the iodin test.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty-two hours the iodin reaction was as strong as at the
beginning, indicating no appreciable starch digestion.</p>

<p>To the flasks in which no digestion had taken place under these conditions,
5&nbsp;mg. of a pancreas ferment was added. This gave an almost immediate conversion
to the colorless end-point. This ferment was a sample of Holadin
which had been in the laboratory about a year. The 5&nbsp;mg. completed the
reaction to the colorless end-point in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>In a similar test I used 2&nbsp;gm. of Lactopeptine No. 3, made up to 100&nbsp;c.c.
with 1.2&nbsp;c.c. of normal alkali. Ten and 15&nbsp;c.c. portions were incubated with
50&nbsp;c.c. of 1 per cent. starch paste through twenty hours at 40 degrees with no
apparent result. The Holadin then added, 5&nbsp;mg. being used, completed the
conversion in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>This shows that the medium was a proper one for the test and that the
Lactopeptine must be extremely weak. No sugar tests were made because
the Lactopeptine contains milk sugar to the extent of about 60 per cent.</p>

<p>Similar results for both protein and starch digestives have been obtained
in a large number of experiments. These here quoted show that the ferment
activity of the preparation is so low as to merit no recognition practically.
The digestion of a few milligrams of fibrin or starch after many hours of
contact, while being perhaps scientifically possible, is of no value when we
come to a consideration of the use of such bodies as digestive ferments in
medicine.</p>

<p>The amount of lactic acid or “loosely combined HCl” present in Lactopeptine
is very small, since the total acid which may be titrated by sodium
hydroxid and phenol­phthalein is measured by 0.5&nbsp;c.c. of the normal hydroxid
for 1&nbsp;gm. of the Lactopeptine powder, in the mean. In different samples
examined the range was found to be from 0.41&nbsp;c.c. to 0.6&nbsp;c.c. Tests with
methyl orange, methyl red and other indicators showed that the free acidity
is but trifling; if the whole of this acid, as measured by phenol­phthalein, were
calculated to HCl, the amount would be too small to have any appreciable
<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>physiologic activity, in view of the daily dose recommended, 10 to 20 grains
of the powder.</p>

<h3>IODUM-MILLER AND IOD-IZD-OIL (MILLER’S)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>

<p>The Council adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>A referee has submitted to the Council the following report of the Chemical
Laboratory of the American Medical Association on Iodum-Miller and Iod-Izd-Oil
(Miller’s) (Iodum-Miller Co., Kansas City, Mo.):</p>

<p>The unsatisfactory statements made in regard to the composition of Iodum-Miller
and the far-reaching therapeutic recommendations for it induced the
laboratory to make a chemical examination of the preparation. It claimed
more or less directly that the preparation is entirely new and possesses novel
characteristics.</p>

<p>It is asserted that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Iodum-Miller is made from Soot Iodine, which is our own product. This Soot Iodine is
SOLUBLE IN WATER before being combined with its base C.P. Glycerine.”</p></div>

<p>No information regarding “soot iodine” is offered and an inquiry sent to
the proprietors by a physician brought only the noncommittal reply that “soot
iodine”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“is made from Resublime [resublimed?] Iodine by a chemical process which renders it
soluble in water before being combined with its base.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span></p>
<p>Iodum-Miller is said to contain</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Active Free Iodine 2.2 grams per 100&nbsp;c.c., 10. grains per fluid ounce, 1.7% by weight.”</p>

<p>“In addition to the active free iodine <span class="ell">..</span>. IODUM-MILLER carries a still greater per
cent of Iodine in its basic combination<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>According to the label, the preparation is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An Iodine for External and Internal use <span class="ell">..</span>. 45 drops equals 1 dr. by weight.
Each drop equals the per cent. of iodine in 1&nbsp;gr. potas. iodide.”</p></div>

<p>Iodum-Miller is a heavy, dark liquid having an odor characteristic of ether
(ethyl oxid). Qualitative tests revealed the presence of glycerin, free iodin,
iodid and potassium. The specific gravity at 25 degrees was 1.284. Direct
titration with sodium thiosulphate solution indicated the presence of 1.68 per
cent. of free iodin. A determination of the total iodin content by the Hunter
method indicated 3.06 per cent. Subtraction of the amount of free iodin found
from the total amount of iodin present, gives 1.38 per cent. combined iodin.
Assuming this to be present as potassium iodid, as appears probable from the
qualitative examination and from the quantitative determination of potassium,
1.80 per cent. potassium iodid is indicated. From this examination it is concluded
that Iodum-Miller is, essentially, a solution of iodin and potassium
iodid in glycerin, containing 1.68 per cent. free iodin and 1.80 per cent. potassium
iodid. The examination contradicts the assumption that Iodum-Miller is
either novel in principle or new. Moreover, accepting the firm’s statement that
45 drops weigh 1 dram (60 grains) the examination shows that one drop equals
not “the per cent. of iodine in 1&nbsp;gr. potas. iodide” but instead, the per cent. of
iodin in only <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span> grain potassium iodid. As the statement that “Each drop
equals the per cent. of iodine in 1&nbsp;gr. potas. iodide” appears on the label of the
trade package, Iodum-Miller would seem to be misbranded under the federal
Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p>The recommended internal dosage of Iodum-Miller (from <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> to 20 drops)
is equivalent to from <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub></span> to 1 grain of potassium iodid. Its external efficacy
in comparison with that of other iodin preparations may be estimated by
comparing the respective free iodin contents, since the germicidal power of
combined iodid is negligible. While Iodum-Miller contains 2.15&nbsp;gm. free
iodin in 100&nbsp;c.c., tincture of iodin contains 7&nbsp;gm. per 100&nbsp;c.c. and compound
solution of iodin (Lugol’s solution) contains 5&nbsp;gm. free iodin in 100&nbsp;gm.</p>

<p>Among the advertising literature is a circular which purports to be a “Certificate
from Kansas City Testing Laboratory, by Roy Cross, Secretary.” The
“certificate” attempts to prove that Iodum-Miller is vastly superior to the official
tincture of iodin as a germicide, asserting that “In the process of dissolving
[tincture of iodin] in water, a very large amount of the iodin is lost by precipitation<span class="ell">...</span>.”
This is not true of the tincture of iodin which is now official,
though it is true of the tincture official in former editions of the Pharmacopeia.
The report ignores completely the widely used aqueous solution of iodin.</p>

<p>Iod-Izd-Oil (Miller’s) is said to be an “Iodine Combination” made “from
the same Soluble Soot Iodine as is IODUM-MILLER.” It is said to “liberate
Free Soluble Iodine” when applied to the skin, mucous surfaces, etc. It is
further defined as “Soluble Iodine combined with water-white Hydrocarbon
Oil” and is said to liberate “Soluble Iodine 2 per cent.” While these statements
suggest that Iod-Izd-Oil (Miller’s) contains the iodin-potassium iodid
combination contained in Iodum-Miller, analysis indicated the oil to be a
simple solution of iodin in liquid petrolatum. Quantitative determinations
indicated, not 2 per cent. of iodin, as claimed, but only 0.42 per cent. and all
of this was present as free iodin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>

<h5>REFEREE’S REPORT</h5>

<p>The following therapeutic claims appear on the label of a bottle of Iodum-Miller:</p>

<p class="tac fs85">“EXTERNAL INDICATIONS</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy, Cough, Sore Throat, Pyorrhea, Tonsilitis, Rheumatism,
Spinal Irritation, Boils, Felons or any Pain. Periostitis, Carbuncles, Fistula in Ano,
Goiter, Blood Poison, Diseases of Uterus and appendages (apply full strength on cotton
wrapped applicator), Gonorrhea, acute or chronic in both sexes, Orchitis, Bubo, Prostatitis,
Swellings, Enlarged Glands, Etc.”</p></div>

<p class="tac fs85">“INTERNAL INDICATIONS</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Pleurisy, Typhoid Fever, Syphilis, Catarrh of Mucous surface
of Alimentary Canal, Autotoxemia, Vomiting of Pregnancy, Rheumatism, Chronic Glandular
and Organic Affections.”</p></div>

<p>The “certificate” from the Kansas City Testing Laboratory, mentioned above,
states that Iodum-Miller was found to have a germicidal value nineteen
times greater than carbolic acid&mdash;a somewhat remarkable finding in view of
the fact that iodin dissolved by means of potassium iodid in alcohol or water,
when tried on the typhoid bacillus has recently been found to possess only
four times the germicidal value of carbolic acid in a solution of the same
strength (Maben and White: <i>Chem. and Drug.</i>, Jan. 30, 1915, p.&nbsp;144). The
“certificate” further states that the test “shows available iodine as found in
IODUM-MILLER to have the greatest bactericidal power of any substance
that we have ever tested that can be used medicinally.” There is no reason
to believe that the desire to please its patrons has led the “testing laboratory”
astray from the literal truth. The laboratory’s experience may be limited and
the statement therefore entirely correct as far as it goes. No mention, however,
is made of any tests comparing the germ-destroying power of Iodum-Miller
with that of tincture of iodin, which contains 7 per cent. free iodin,
unless the casual statement that “Iodum-Miller sterilized [the skin] more
quickly” than tincture of iodin, be taken to imply such tests. It is not clear,
however, by what means the laboratory was able to determine that there were
no bacteria left alive in the skin after application of tincture of iodin and
Iodum-Miller; no details are given of the methods used in arriving at this
conclusion.</p>

<p>A circular says that Iodum-Miller</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. gives the Greatest Bactericidal and Therapeutic Action, whether used Internally,
Externally, Hypodermically or Intravenously.”</p></div>

<p>In the light of the preceding report of the Chemical Laboratory of the
Association, these claims require little comment. The laboratory has shown
that the free iodin content (and consequently the germicidal efficiency) of
Iodum-Miller is less than half that of Lugol’s solution, and less than a third
of that of the official tincture of iodin. As for the advice to use Iodum-Miller
internally in diseases ranging from pneumonia to syphilis and from typhoid
to tuberculosis, in order to be convinced of its dangerous character, it is necessary
only to recall that this treatment is equivalent to the administration of
small doses of iodid&mdash;from <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub></span> to 1 grain of potassium iodid. The mystery
being removed from the composition of Iodum-Miller, the absurd extravagance
of the claims made for it becomes manifest. The criticisms of the Council
on the recommendations for Burnham’s Soluble Iodine (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
May 15, 1915, p.&nbsp;1673) apply in almost every particular to Iodum-Miller.</p>

<p>Unwarranted therapeutic claims are made for Iodum-Miller; incorrect
statements are made with regard to its composition and that of Iod-Izd-Oil
(Miller’s); and the application of a trade name to both of these products is
unjustifiable, since neither is original. It is therefore recommended that
Iodum-Miller and Iod-Izd-Oil (Miller’s) be held ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies&mdash;(<i>Abstracted in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 2, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>ELIXIR IODO-BROMIDE OF CALCIUM COMP. “WITHOUT
MERCURY” AND “WITH MERCURY”</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Tilden Company, New Lebanon, N.&nbsp;Y., and St. Louis, Mo., sells “Elixir
Iodo-Bromide of Calcium Comp. without Mercury” and “Elixir Iodo-Bromide
of Calcium Comp. with Mercury.” The latter is said to contain, in addition to
the ingredients of the former, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span> grain mercuric chlorid in each fluidram.
According to the label the formula of the elixir “without mercury” is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Formula</i>&mdash;Salts of Iodine, Bromine, Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium with
Stillingia, Sarsaparilla, Rumex, Dulcamara, Lappa, Taraxacum, Menispermum.”</p></div>

<p>A recent circular declares that the elixir contains:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. a number of the most powerful alteratives of the pharmacopeia such as chemically
pure iodin, magnesium, potassium with sarsaparilla, stillingia, prickly ash, burdock,
taraxacum, etc. <span class="ell">..</span>. Each fluidounce contains seventy-two grains of the combined salts.”</p></div>

<p>The same circular also alleges that each dram of the preparation contains:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the equivalent of one and one-half grains of the combined iodids, potassium and
calcium&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>It will be observed that, (1) the two statements quoted from the circular
make no reference to bromids; (2) the statement that each dram contains “the
equivalent” of 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains of the combined iodids, potassium and calcium,
accounts for but 12 of the 72 grains of “the combined salts” per fluidounce
declared in the preceding quotation; (3) the circular mentions the presence of
a drug&mdash;prickly ash&mdash;not declared on the label and, finally (4) none of the
“formulas” gives the quantities of all of the several constituents.</p>

<p>It is evident from these “formulas” that the Tilden Company continues its
policy of concealment and mystification as exemplified in the cases of Hydrocyanate
of Iron, Tilden (discussed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, June 19, 1909, p.&nbsp;2008),
Febrisol (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, June 29, 1912, p.&nbsp;2043) and Respirazone (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
June 14, 1913, p.&nbsp;1899).</p>

<p>In the circular just quoted (“The Conquest of Syphilis”), all hope for the
syphilitic is declared to rest in mercury and iodin, and it is implied that only
through Elixir Iodo-Bromide of Calcium Comp. is it possible to obtain the
greatest good from these drugs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Were the cleansing influences of these two drugs [mercury and iodin] unavailable to
the luetic patient, he, truly, would be as pitiable an object as the leper <span class="ell">..</span>.</p>

<p>“Modern Pharmacy has devised no better means of utilizing these anti-syphilitics than
Elixir Iodo-Bromide of Calcium Comp. (Tilden) with or without mercury<span class="ell">...</span>. The Elixir,
in proper dosage, acts in specific fashion and is adapted for use in all stages of the disease.</p>

<p>“In the early months <span class="ell">..</span>. Elixir Iodo-Bromide of Calcium Comp. (Tilden) with mercury
is a trustworthy weapon and the physician need have no fear but that it will subjugate
the disease <span class="ell">..</span>.</p>

<p>“When <span class="ell">..</span>. the virulent stage is passed <span class="ell">..</span>. Elixir Iodo-Bromide of Calcium
Comp. (Tilden) without mercury may be given the patient with every assurance that medicine’s
most aggressive measures are being resorted to <span class="ell">..</span>. From time to time, up to the
very end of the time honored three years’ period of treatment, it is well to put the patient
back on the bichloride, using for this purpose the form of the Elixir administered in the first
stages of the disease <span class="ell">..</span>.</p>

<p>“This regime <span class="ell">..</span>. will indubitably antidote the virus of syphilis and eradicate from
the organism its every vestige.”</p></div>

<p>While it seems incredible that any physician would jeopardize the health&mdash;even
the life&mdash;of a patient by accepting this boastful magniloquence as sound
therapeutic advice, still the fact that certain medical journals lend their advertising
pages to advertisements for Tilden’s Elixir with the caption “The Conquest
of Syphilis” makes it incumbent on the Council to record its condemnation
of the employment of this unscientific, semisecret mixture.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Elixir Iodo-Bromide of Calcium Comp. “without
mercury” and “with mercury” be held in conflict with Rule 1 (secrecy of composition),
Rule 6 (unwarranted therapeutic claims) and Rule 10 (unscientific
composition).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 6, 1915.</i>)</p>

<h3>LECITHIN PREPARATIONS OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report was sent to the manufacturers of the various lecithin
preparations mentioned therein. As the replies of the manufacturers were
obviously written from the commercial point of view and did not affect the
Council’s conclusion that lecithin, when indicated, would be given more advantageously
in the form of yolk of egg than in the less pure manufactured product,
the Council directed that the report be published, together with extracts from
the replies of the manufacturers.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Commercial lecithin preparations are at best very impure substances; all
are more or less altered from the original composition. Even with great care,
the methods of extraction and drying always produce considerable decomposition;
and in some cases the phosphorus and nitrogen contents bear but little
relation to the theoretical values. (Long, J.&nbsp;H.: <i>Jour. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, xxx,
881. McLean, Hugh: <i>Chem. Abstracts</i>, May 20, 1915). There is not the slightest
reliable evidence that commercial lecithin has any advantage over the
lecithin contained in natural foods; the weight of probability is on the other
side.</p>

<p>The doses recommended, moreover, are absurdly small; and the amount
thus administered is without practical value. Why administer a few milligrams
of a more or less decomposed lecithin when it is possible to give a far larger
weight of a purer substance in the form of yolk of egg?</p>

<p>In view of these considerations the Council voted that the following proprietary
products be omitted from the next edition of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.:</p>

<p class="ml5em">
Glycerole of Lecithin<br />
Lecibrin<br />
Lecithin Solution<br />
Lecithol<br />
Neuro-Lecithin-Abbott<br />
</p>

<p>and that the general article on “Lecithin Preparations” be transferred to the
annual Council Reports as a matter of record.</p>

<p>The report was submitted to the manufacturers. Their replies were evidently
based on commercial consideration, and called for no modification in
the report.</p>

<p>The referee recommended that the preceding report be published together
with the following extracts from the replies of the manufacturers:</p>

<p>From Armour and Company:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are selling a good deal of Lecithol and it seems to be giving satisfactory results in
some quarters<span class="ell">...</span>. We shall continue to advertise Lecithol along the lines we have
employed heretofore.”</p></div>

<p>From the Abbott Laboratories:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We can assure you of our confidence in the therapeutic value of Neuro-Lecithin. This
has been attested by the reports of favorable results sent us by many physicians, as well as by
the periodical literature of the last few years which contains a considerable number of very
encouraging references to lecithin therapy.”</p></div>

<p>From Fairchild Bros. &amp; Foster:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We would like simply to say that the physician and the Council must be aware of the
circumstances and the purposes which actuated us in placing lecithin at disposal, viz., the
studies&mdash;research&mdash;of lecithin and the properties attributed to it and which led to inquiry
for and consideration of it. The <i>quantities</i> proposed for medicinal use were not suggested by
us; the suggestion of lecithin in small quantities as a therapeutic agent was obviously directed
<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>by those who proposed it<span class="ell">...</span>. The question whether lecithin, per se, has therapeutic
properties in contrast to lecithin as naturally contained in food substances, is something we
do not undertake to decide. The Council, on purely theoretical grounds, decides in the negative
notwithstanding clinical experience&mdash;internal and hypodermic&mdash;and thus would deny
lecithin the status of a new and nonofficial remedy, worthy of at least tentative progressive
clinical consideration. We can only say that we offered bona fide lecithin and that we did
not make the investigation of lecithin a pretext for the sale of all sorts of lecithin ‘jumbles’
with lecithin in small proportions, taking their name and making their bid on lecithin.”</p></div>

<p>Below appears the general article which has been omitted from N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.:</p>


<h4>Lecithin Preparations</h4>

<p>Lecithins are fat-like bodies belonging to the group of phosphatides. They
all consist of glyceryl esters containing two fatty acid radicals and the phosphoric
acid radical in which one of the residual hydrogens is replaced by the
choline group. The fatty acid may be palmitic, oleic or stearic and various
combinations are known to exist; for example, distearyl lecithin, stearyl palmityl
lecithin and so on. The commercial lecithins usually include the closely related
kephalins.</p>

<p>On saponification the lecithins split more or less readily into choline, the
fatty acids and glycerophosphoric acid, and by fusion with alkali nitrate and
carbonate they yield alkali phosphate. They occur, free or in combination as
lecithoproteins, most abundantly in certain animal tissues, but there are also
vegetable lecithins. The lecithins of commerce are obtained usually from yolks
of eggs or from calves’ or sheep’s brains.</p>

<p>Numerous processes have been devised for the preparation of lecithin from
egg-yolk or animal tissue. From egg-yolk it may be obtained by making an
alcoholic extract and precipitating by cadmium chloride. The precipitate is
washed with alcohol and ether, mixed with 80 per cent. alcohol and warmed
with the proper amount of ammonium carbonate to remove the cadmium. After
filtering hot and concentrating the filtrate the lecithin is thrown down by cooling
to a low temperature&mdash;10&nbsp;C. or below. The precipitate is taken up in
chloroform and reprecipitated by acetone.</p>

<p>From tissues it is obtained by extracting with warm alcohol and ether, concentrating
the extract, precipitating with acetone and repeating the operations.</p>

<p>Pure lecithin is white, but the commercial preparations are yellowish-brown
wax-like solids, which are not soluble in water but form milky emulsions
which exhibit the myeline figures under the microscope. The solubility in cold
alcohol or ether is slight, but heat aids it. Lecithins are not soluble in acetone.
They are hygroscopic and the water mixtures undergo decomposition on standing.
They darken on exposure to air and light.</p>

<p>The alcoholic solution is precipitated by platinum or cadmium chloride.
It is decomposed by alkalies with the formation of choline and tri­methyl­amine.
The ash contains phosphoric acid. The different lecithins contain from 3.84
to 4.12 per cent. of phosphorus and 1.73 to 1.86 per cent. of nitrogen. The ratio
of nitrogen to phosphorus should be at 1 to 2.21.</p>

<p>Lecithin is incompatible with alkalies; it should be kept in well-stoppered
bottles and should be protected from the light.</p>

<p>The content of lecithin (plus kephalin) in tissues is about as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><td class="tac" colspan="2">Per Cent.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><i>Actions and Uses.</i>&mdash;The lecithin preparations have been recommended in
many pathologic conditions, especially in malnutrition and sexual debility.
<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>Moderate doses are said to bring about a marked retention of nitrogen and
phosphorus, but satisfactory proof of this is lacking. It is extremely unlikely
that the small doses which have been recommended in pill or tablet form or
in emulsions can have any perceptible action, in view of the fact that many of
our natural foods contain much greater weights of available lecithins than the
medicinal doses provide. There is no good basis for the statement that the
free lecithin has a greater food value or is more readily assimilated than is
the substance as found in eggs or tissue. The reverse proposition is much
more likely to be true, especially when it is considered that the commercial
preparations are usually somewhat altered or decomposed in the process of
separation.</p>

<p><i>Dosage.</i>&mdash;Given by the mouth in the form of pills, tablets or glycero-alcoholic
emulsions. The amount of actual lecithin ingested in this way is usually small
because of the doubtful purity of the original preparation. Several doses, as
commonly administered, would be required to furnish the amount of lecithin
present in a small egg.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,
1915, p.&nbsp;122.</i>)</p>

<h3>PROPRIETARY NAMES FOR LIQUID PETROLATUM</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>

<p>The Council has accepted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<p>A former report of the Council (Liquid Petrolatum or “Russian Mineral
Oil,” Report Council Pharm. and Chem., <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, May 30, 1914, p.&nbsp;1740)
called attention to the large number of concerns that were placing on the market
liquid petrolatum as a proprietary under coined names. Since then the number
of such products has increased. The Council has been requested by several concerns
to consider their products put out under proprietary brand names.</p>

<p>The rules of the Council affirm that “the application of ‘trade names’ to
official or established nonproprietary substances tends to confusion and fosters
many abuses.” In accordance with this general ruling, the Council has
invariably refused to countenance proprietary names applied to liquid petrolatum.
The Council holds that proprietary or coined names for this substance
are detrimental to medical progress, since they are sure to foster the impression
that the particular product is different from liquid petrolatum. Manufacturers
have been advised that there is no objection to distinguishing their
products by the addition of their firm name or the initial representing the firm
name; for instance, “Liquid Petrolatum, A.&nbsp;B. and Co.” or “Liquid Petrolatum,
Smith.” The Council also believes that such designations as “Star Liquid
Petrolatum” or “Liquid Petrolatum, Anchor Brand,” may be regarded as
unobjectionable, provided that the words “Liquid Petrolatum” are always used
in connection with the brand designation and given equal prominence.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>SENG</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>

<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<p>Seng (Sultan Drug Co., St. Louis) is called by the manufacturers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. a palatable preparation of Panax (Ginseng) in an aromatic vehicle.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span></p>
<p>Regarding ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolia</i>) the United States Dispensatory,
nineteenth edition, page 1603, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The extraordinary medicinal virtues formerly ascribed to ginseng had no other existence
than in the imagination of the Chinese. It is little more than a demulcent, and in this country
is not employed as a medicine.”</p></div>

<p>No discussion of ginseng is to be found in the more recently published books
on pharmacology, materia medica and therapeutics, evidently because their
authors agree with this estimate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, physicians are told through the medium of advertisements
appearing in medical journals that Seng is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An efficient remedy in all affections in which the gastro-intestinal glands need
stimulating.</p>

<p>“Exceptionally useful in atonic indigestion, malnutrition, convalescence from the acute
diseases, and all digestive disorders characterized by deranged or depressed functions.”
(<i>Woman’s Medical Journal</i>, July, 1914.)</p></div>

<p>According to the label, Seng is indicated in “indigestion,” “malassimilation,”
“malnutrition” and “wasting diseases.” It is also stated&mdash;though the preparation
is admitted to contain 18 per cent. of alcohol&mdash;that to give babies “ten to
fifteen drops in water or milk during feeding” is a proper procedure and that
“For Colic, Flatulency, etc., the dose for an adult or child may be repeated
every half hour until relieved.”</p>

<p>The following are some of the exaggerated therapeutic claims made for this
preparation of a worthless drug:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As a result of its administration the gastro-intestinal secretions are augmented, the
digestion of food is substantially increased, and fermentative processes are promptly overcome.”</p>

<p>“Seng will specifically encourage the secretion of the juices in the entire alimentary
tract&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The formula furnished for Seng is non-quantitative and therefore meaningless.
The preparation is exploited in a manner to encourage its ill-advised use
by the public, and exaggerated and unwarranted therapeutic claims are made
for it. The use of an inefficient or worthless drug like ginseng, moreover, is
detrimental to rational therapeutics. The Council therefore voted that Seng
be refused recognition for conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6 and 10.&mdash;(<i>From Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1915, p.&nbsp;129.</i>)</p>

<h3>FROSST’S BLAUD CAPSULES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Frosst’s Blaud Capsules and Frosst’s Blaud, Arsenic and Strychnine Capsules
were submitted to the Council by C.&nbsp;E. Frosst &amp; Co., Montreal, Canada.
This firm claims, on the authority of the report of a firm of analytical chemists,
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. of three leading Blaud preparations bought by us on the open market, the iron
in Frosst’s Blaud Capsules showed the highest percentage of <i>Ferrous</i> carbonate.”</p></div>

<p>The Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association found this
claim unjustified. The laboratory reported that there was no especial difference
in the ferrous iron content of the various Blaud pills found on the market,
and that among ten specimens examined, the total iron content was the lowest
in the Frosst specimen. In view of this the Council refused recognition to
Frosst’s Blaud Capsules and Frosst’s Blaud, Arsenic and Strychnine Capsules.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1915, p.&nbsp;164.</i>)</p>

<h3>TYREE’S ELIXIR OF BUCHU AND HYOSCYAMUS COMPOUND</h3>

</table></div>

<p>The manufacturer, J.&nbsp;S. Tyree, Washington, D.&nbsp;C., offers this formula to
the medical profession with the following claim:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Approximate composition made [sic] by quantitative and qualitative analysis of the
finished product.”</p></div>

<p>It is also claimed that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An even greater advantage of Tyree’s Buchu and Hyoscyamus Compound over other
drugs, lies in the fact that every constituent of the former is required to conform to a fixed
standard of active principle strength; hence the results derivable from it are absolutely
uniform.”</p></div>

<p>These pretentious claims of scientific accuracy look rather absurd to chemists.
Many of the substances present in buchu, hops, hyoscyamus, uva ursi and
pareira brava are also present in other drugs; hence it would never occur to
a pharmaceutical chemist to try to ascertain the composition of such a mixture
as Tyree’s Elixir by “quantitative and qualitative analysis of the finished
product,” much less to determine the “active principle strength” of each ingredient,
for no methods are known by which this can be done.</p>

<p>It is claimed that, because of the care exercised in making Tyree’s Elixir</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the results derivable from it are absolutely uniform.”</p></div>

<p>A moment’s reflection, however, must compel any physician to attribute this
statement, on the most charitable construction, to sheer ignorance. Of course,
even a definite chemical principle, such as quinin, does not exert uniform
clinical action, for clinical conditions vary, and accordingly the patient may
or may not be cured. It is simply preposterous to claim that the clinical
results obtained from such substances as hops, pareira brava, buchu and uva
ursi are absolutely uniform.</p>

<p>A peculiarly vicious claim is that the elixir renders the mucous surfaces
of the genito-urinary tract “hostile to the multiplication of the gonococci.”
Since infection with the gono­coccus produces the direst results, any claim
which means in plain English that the remedy assists in producing a cure or
in preventing infection with that organism cannot be condemned too strongly.
Uva ursi, to be sure, has some slight antiseptic action but it is devoid of any
curative action in gonorrhea and the minute amounts that are present in the
Tyree elixir are of no more protective value against gonorrheal infection than
a grain of hexa­methylen­amin would be.</p>

<p>It is further claimed that the elixir is a “specific” for “Inflammation of the
Bladder, Bright’s Disease, Renal Colic, Suppurative Nephritis, Acute Cystitis,
Urethritis, Catarrh of the Bladder [it would be interesting to know what
distinction the manufacturer draws between ‘Inflammation of the Bladder,’
‘Cystitis’ and ‘Catarrh of the Bladder’], Acidemia, Edema, Vesical Catarrh of
Old Age, Lithemia” and that ascites and anasarca “can be reduced greatly to
the satisfaction of the patient, and honor of the physician” by using a mixture
<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>of Tyree’s Elixir and infusion of digitalis. Such claims as these do not merit
serious discussion, for they carry their own refutation.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Tyree’s Elixir of Buchu and Hyoscyamus Compound
be held in conflict with Rules 5, 6 and 10 and that publication of this report
be authorized.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1915,

<h3>HYDROLEINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Hydroleine (Charles N. Crittenton Company, New York) is a cod liver oil
emulsion said to contain 45 per cent. of cod liver oil, a trace of salicylic acid
and 18<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains of “Pancreatin, Etc.,” per ounce. The advertising claims are
based largely on the theory that cod liver oil is “that particular fat which
dietetic experience and physiological chemistry have proved to be most digestible.”
As a matter of fact, while the superior digestibility of cod liver oil over
other oils has often been asserted, neither “dietetic experience” nor “physiological
chemistry” have “proved” this by definite observations. The Crittenton
Company claims that it is more readily split than other oils. This is probably
not true, easy emulsification of the raw oil being often confounded with easy
splitting. This latter claim, however, is offered in justification of the name
“Hydroleine,” which the Crittenton Company interprets as “hydrated oil.” A
circular wrapped around the bottle contains the assertion that “Cod Liver Oil
has long been held in high esteem by the medical profession for the treatment
of a large number of serious diseases.” This recommendation is likely to lead
the public to place undue reliance on Hydroleine in the grave conditions
mentioned.</p>

<p>The preparation is in conflict with the rules of the Council inasmuch as its
name does not indicate its composition, unwarranted therapeutic claims are
made for it, and the exploitation is likely to give the public unwarranted confidence
in its value. The Council therefore held Hydroleine ineligible for New
and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>CURATIVE VACCINE, BRUSCHETTINI</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Curative Vaccine, Bruschettini, manufactured by A. Bruschettini, Genoa,
Italy, is claimed to have the properties “of acting directly on the tubercular
bacillus, bringing directly into the field and determining a hyperproduction of
antibacillar and antitoxic substances.” The use of the preparation is said to
be indicated in “all forms of tuberculosis.”</p>

<p>A referee reported to the Council that he had examined the available information
and believed that the use of this product had no satisfactory experimental
basis. The method of preparation appears to be based more on theoretical
considerations than on experimental basis.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on Serums and Vaccines the
Council voted that Curative Vaccine, Bruschettini, be not accepted because (1)
the method used for the production of the vaccine was not satisfactorily stated;
(2) the theory on which its use is based has not been satisfactorily confirmed,
and (3) the value of the product is not upheld by satisfactory clinical evidence.</p>

<p>The Council’s findings, in accordance with its procedure, were sent to the
manufacturers for comment. His reply was considered by a new referee who
found that the matter presented did not warrant a revision of the Council’s
conclusions. Accordingly the Council directed publication of its findings.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1915, p.&nbsp;176.</i>)</p>

<h3>STEARNS’ WINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Frederick Stearns &amp; Co. market a preparation known as “Stearns’ Wine,”
“Stearns’ Wine of Cod Liver Ext. with Peptonate of Iron,” and as “Vinum
Ext. Morrhuae, Stearns.” The constituents are said to be “concentrated extract
of fresh cod livers,” “Peptonate of Iron” and a “fine quality of prime Sherry
Wine” containing 18 per cent. of alcohol.</p>

<p>This preparation was at one time marketed through the medical profession,
but is now advertised direct to the public in typical “patent medicine” style.
The label on a recently purchased bottle of Stearns’ Wine contains the following
statements:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“STEARNS WINE is an ideal tonic for elderly people, for weak, pale and delicate children
and convalescents.</p>

<p>“STEARNS WINE has for many years been successfully prescribed in the treatment of
general or nervous exhaustion, anemia, malnutrition, loss of appetite, loss of sleep, faulty circulation
and impoverished blood supply.”</p></div>

<p>The scope of the recommendations for the preparation is further indicated
in a booklet accompanying the bottle, which begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“STEARNS’ WINE, What It Is and Why It Is Good for You.”</p></div>

<p>The conclusion is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“STEARNS’ WINE is a safe medicine for the young, middle-aged and old. It is a safeguard
to the family health.”</p></div>

<p>It is not necessary to discuss either these all-embracing claims as to the
therapeutic efficacy of the mixture or the fallacies presented in favor of cod-liver
extract and peptonate of iron. The Council reaffirms the opinion that
whatever therapeutic value cod liver may have resides chiefly, if not entirely,
in its fatty constituents (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Oct. 9, 1909; Reports Council Pharm.
and Chem., 1909, p.&nbsp;115). A confirmation of this opinion has recently been
furnished by the investigations of Prof. J.&nbsp;P. Street (<span class="smcap">The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</span>,
Feb. 20, 1915, p.&nbsp;638) of several cod liver cordials, one of which (Vinol) like
Stearns’ Wine, is described as a wine of cod liver extract with peptonate of
iron.</p>

<p>Stearns’ Wine is essentially an alcoholic stimulant. It is not “a safe medicine
for the young, middle-aged and old.” The unwarranted therapeutic claims
and the recommendations for its indiscriminate use bring it into conflict with
Rules 4 and 6. The Council voted that Stearns’ Wine be held ineligible for
inclusion in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>PROTONUCLEIN AND PROTONUCLEIN BETA</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council had adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Protonuclein, with other products of Reed and Carnrick, was examined by
the Council in 1907 and found ineligible for admission to New and Non­official
Remedies. According to the patent specifications, it is prepared “from the
thyroid and thymus glands, brain (pineal glands and pituitary body), bone-marrow,
pancreas, spleen, liver, salivary glands, Brunner’s glands, Lieberkühn’s
follicles and peptic glands.” These various glandular bodies, it is said,
are dried at a temperature below 130&nbsp;F. (preferably between 100 and 110); the
fat is removed by ether, the dried glands disintegrated, the connective tissue
removed by sifting and the resulting powder coated with an ether solution of
<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>benzoin and mixed with milk sugar. The dose is three to ten tablets (9 to
30 grains) daily.</p>

<p>Protonuclein Beta is said to be produced by the addition to Protonuclein
of an equal amount of nucleoplasm and protoplasm of the spleen. The dose is
from two cubes (each 5 grains) three times a day to three cubes four times a
day (30 to 60 grains daily).</p>

<p>Special advantages over ordinary nuclein are attributed to Protonuclein, in
which, it is claimed, certain unaltered cells remain that are more easily assimilated
by the leukocytes than are ordinary proteins, thus leading to a multiplication
of cells. In the early advertising Protonuclein was claimed to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. an exact physiological product derived from the lymphoid structures of the body
without the use of chemical agents<span class="ell">...</span>. So delicate is Protonuclein that any chemical
agent is liable to disturb its cellular activity.”</p></div>

<p>After its examination of the product in 1907 (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Oct. 5, 1907, p.
1198), the Council concluded that any distinction between the action of Protonuclein
and that of ordinary nuclein was purely speculative and highly improbable.
“If the active ingredients are really so unstable that they are destroyed
by all chemical agents, as claimed, it seems impossible that the activity would
be preserved when Protonuclein is given by mouth and therefore subjected to
the very profound changes of digestion.”</p>

<p>At that time the importance of thyroid as an ingredient had not been emphasized.
The following year, however, Hunt and Seidell (<span class="smcap">The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</span>, Oct. 24, 1908)
reported the results of an investigation which showed that
Protonuclein was a diluted thyroid preparation, as skilfully disguised as in
the antifats Rengo and Marmola. Hunt later pointed out (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb.
1, 1913, p.&nbsp;384) that the amount of nuclein contained in a dose of Protonuclein
probably would not have the slightest effect, especially when given by mouth.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from the Protonuclein advertising matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For cancer, infectious fevers (measles, scarlet fever, typhoid and septicaemia) and as a
prophylactic.”</p>

<p>“Protonuclein: An ideal prophylactic for all infectious Diseases.”</p>

<p>“A true alterative and tissue builder.”</p>

<p>“The value of Protonuclein depends upon its ability to increase cell power and promote
tissue strength. It is therefore needed whenever the organism is below the normal standard,
more especially in Anaemia, Typhoid, Neoplasms and as a Prophylactic.”</p></div>

<p>All the foregoing claims and recommendations are supposed to be based on
certain alleged discoveries which the Council has previously characterized as
“a tissue of vague speculations <span class="ell">..</span>. in direct conflict with the known facts
of physiologic chemistry.” As for the third claim, Hunt and Seidell have commented
on the danger of recommending thyroid, the most powerful tissue-destroying
drug known, as a “tissue builder.”</p>

<p>Protonuclein Beta, it is said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. combines the reconstructive action of Protonuclein with the action of the vital
principle of the spleen, making it a distinct product for use in all tubercular troubles, including
phthisis, localized joint affections and scrofular conditions.”</p></div>

<p>This product, according to the manufacturers, is based on the work of a
certain Dr. Bayle of Cannes, France. Dr. Bayle said that he had treated
tuberculous patients with fresh ground up spleen of hogs (25–100 grams per
day), mixed with fruit preserve or bouillon; in cases in which this brought on
gastro-intestinal disorders, extract of the spleen pulp was administered hypodermically.
Bayle reported extraordinary improvements in the physical and
mental conditions of his patients even after a few days of this treatment; over
90 per cent. of his tuberculous patients, according to him, improved or were
cured. This applied to all types and stages of tuberculosis in man. “With
the spleen pulp treatment tuberculous glands disappear like syphilis lesions on
administration of mercury and iodids.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>
<p>This “spleen specific” of Bayle lacks scientific foundation; Bayle’s own
cases were not adequately controlled, and no notice has been taken of Bayle’s
report by experts on tuberculosis. Hence it practically lacks both confirmation
and contradiction.</p>

<p>The spleen is invaded by tubercle bacilli quite as frequently as are the
kidneys and the liver; it has no special toxic action on these bacilli. Nor is
there any reason to believe that the end products of gastric and intestinal
digestion of spleen pulp, after absorption into the blood, exert such toxic action.
It cannot be assumed that these end products indirectly aid the healing processes
through improved metabolism, for there is no evidence that they have any
specific nutritive or stimulating action after such absorption. Altogether, what
we know of the physiology and pathology of the spleen does not warrant us
in looking for a “specific” against tuberculosis in this organ.</p>

<p>If, however, the known facts did justify any hope that the spleen might furnish
such a specific, manufacturers would not be warranted in exploiting or
physicians in prescribing spleen products as a remedy for tuberculosis until
control experiments on animals had confirmed the therapeutic value of these
products. In a chronic disease like tuberculosis, no conclusions that are
scientifically valid can be drawn from clinical cases until many cases have
been observed for years under suitable conditions. Right here it may be said
that the clinical “evidence” offered in favor of Protonuclein Beta is worthless.
The observations which have been reported on this product are not such as to
permit any valid final conclusions to be drawn with regard to its value.</p>

<p>The rational method of proving the worth of an alleged new specific such
as this is by animal experimentation. So far as we know, neither Dr. Bayle
nor the Reed and Carnrick company has performed any such experiments with
“spleen pulp” or Protonuclein Beta; nor are we aware that any competent
investigator has done so. There is, to the best of our knowledge, no scientific
evidence on which to base the claims for Protonuclein Beta.</p>

<p>The Council reaffirms its former action with regard to Protonuclein. The
objections made to Protonuclein apply with equal force to Protonuclein Beta.
In view of the lack of evidence, the claims for Protonuclein Beta are unwarranted
and the product is ineligible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. on account of noncompliance
with Rules 1, 6 and 8.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 1, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>HYDROPSIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Hydropsin is marketed by the Ernst Bischoff Company, Inc., New York.
Its composition is thus described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hydropsin is the standardized dialysate of Digitalis purpurea, Betula alba, Scilla maritima,
Juniperis communis, and Herniaria glabra; or, stated otherwise, it is the juice of these
drugs, dialyzed and physiologically standardized.”</p>

<p>“Each fluid dram represents Digitalysatum 7 gtts., and 2 gtts. each of the dialysates of
Betula, Herniaria, Juniper and Scilla.”</p></div>

<p>The composition of Hydropsin must be considered essentially secret since
the amounts of the several constituent drugs in a given amount of “dialysate”
are not disclosed. The active principle of juniper is a volatile oil which is
practically insoluble in water; it is difficult to believe that the “juice” of
juniper submitted to dialysis could contain any material amount of the active
constituent. No information is given as to the method used whereby the several
dialysates are “physiologically standardized.” It therefore remains to be proved
<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>that the manufacturer of Hydropsin possesses any method whereby the dialysates
of juniper (Juniperis communis), birch (Betula alba, the common
European birch) and knot weed (Herniaria glabra) are so standardized. The
claim is made that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Herniaria has long been recognized as one of the most valuable drugs in the treatment
of dropsical affections due to cardiac impairment.”</p></div>

<p>On the contrary, Herniaria belongs to that large class of drugs which have
been tried, found wanting and abandoned. It is a very old remedy, and the
claims made for it are an inheritance from the early herbalists, with whom it
was very popular. According to King’s American Dispensatory, it was “principally
employed to cure <i>hernia</i> (hence its name) and to increase the flow of
urine. It was also said to increase the flow of bile<span class="ell">...</span>. Internally and
externally, it was praised in <i>snake-bites</i>, and the powdered plant was employed
to kill maggots on unhealthy <i>sores</i> of horses. It was reputed to ‘crush’ and
expel calculi from the kidneys and bladder<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>The Ernst Bischoff Company says that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Betula exerts both an antiseptic and stimulating influence on the urinary passages and is
particularly serviceable where a catarrhal condition of the bladder exists. When combined
with other diuretics, as in Hydropsin, the drug affords highly satisfactory results in the treatment
of ascites, cardiac dropsy and hydrothorax.”</p></div>

<p>Birch is another drug which has been discarded. Few textbooks on materia
medica even mention it. That it can materially affect the action of such powerful
drugs as squill and digitalis is exceedingly doubtful.</p>

<p>An unwarranted implication&mdash;that in this preparation the powerful drugs
digitalis and squill have been deprived of their dangerous qualities&mdash;is the
assertion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dialysis, removing all resins and colloidals, results in better tolerance on part of sensitive
patients, and in more rapid absorption and elimination; which, in turn, means early therapeutic
effects and little or no fear of toxic accumulation.”</p></div>

<p>That removal of colloids and resins materially affects the tolerance of these
drugs is improbable. To claim that because of their removal, there need be
“little or no fear of toxic accumulation” is utterly without warrant. The
claim that one preparation containing digitalis is less likely to produce cumulative
effect than any other digitalis preparation is contradicted by a mass
of evidence.</p>

<p>It is claimed that Hydropsin affects “favorably all forms of dropsy or Edema
that are at all amenable to medical treatment.” There can be no question but
that squill and digitalis, or, better, either singly, used in suitable cases, may
relieve dropsical effusions; but to claim that such a complex mixture as
Hydropsin can favorably affect all forms of dropsy that are amenable to medical
treatment is on its face unwarranted.</p>

<p>The claim is made that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By reason of its unusual potency and relative harmlessness, Hydropsin may be employed
to great advantage in all cases where it is desirable to increase the volume of urine without
injury to the renal structures.”</p></div>

<p>On the basis of the claimed composition, the action of Hydropsin must be
essentially that of digitalis or of digitalis and squill. Consequently, if it possesses
“unusual potency,” it cannot possess “relative harmlessness,” and vice
versa. Neither digitalis nor squill should be employed “in all cases” of
nephritis, even if it is “desirable to increase the volume of urine.”</p>

<p>The composition claimed for Hydropsin brands it as an irrational mixture

<h3>DIGITALYSATUM</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Digitalysatum is sold in the United States by Ernst Bischoff Company, Inc.,
New York. The firm claims that it is a dialysate prepared from the juice of
freshly gathered digitalis, containing all the active principles, and representing
the fresh plant weight for weight. It is said to be standardized physiologically
and to contain 12 per cent. alcohol. Sterisol-Digitalysatum, intended for injection,
appears to be the “dialysate” without alcohol, diluted with equal parts of
physiologic sodium chlorid solution. The Council some years ago found both
products ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies because of unwarranted
therapeutic claims. The preparations are still being advertised to physicians
under claims which imply superiority to all other digitalis preparations. For
instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Digitalysatum is the diuretic <i>par excellence</i> in cardiac insufficiency&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“Digitalysatum as a diuretic and cardiac stimulant is in a class by itself, being quick of
action, uniform in strength, and well tolerated.”</p>

<p>“Digitalysatum differs from other forms of digitalis in these respects<span class="ell">:..</span>. Digitalysatum
is free from fat, resins and colloids, and is therefore well-borne by sensitive patients&mdash;the
young and the feeble&mdash;and is quickly absorbed and eliminated<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The Council has elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">28</a> expressed the conviction that tincture of digitalis
produces the full therapeutic effects of digitalis; that, when properly made, the
tincture is as stable as any liquid preparation of digitalis now available, and
that attempts to enhance the reputation of proprietary products by exaggerating
the disadvantages of the official preparation are to be deplored. No adequate
evidence is offered of the claimed superiority of action of Digitalysatum.</p>

<p>By implication, the claim is made that Digitalysatum is superior to other
digitalis preparations in respect to toxicity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Free from fat, resins and colloidals, it is always well borne and is quickly absorbed and
eliminated. No case of toxic accumulation (faulty elimination) has ever been reported.”</p></div>

<p>That Digitalysatum is free from the dangers of toxic cumulation is highly
improbable; in fact, it is inconsistent with the statement that the preparation
contains all the constituents found in the fresh plant. Even if instances of
cumulative action have not been reported this does not prove that such cumulative
action does not occur. The tincture of digitalis has the systemic side-effects
of digitalis in no greater degree than the various proprietary preparations.
Attempts to create the impression that Digitalysatum possesses all the
virtues of digitalis without its chief disadvantage are to be condemned as
likely to lead to incautious use of the preparation.</p>

<p>These exaggerated claims are in the main made indirectly, but they are
none the less inimical to sound therapy. The Council therefore declared
Digitalysatum ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies and voted that this
report be published.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 8, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>SO-CALLED SECRETIN PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council authorized the following report for publication, and voted to
endorse the work of Professor Carlson discussed therein.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Council has not accepted for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies
any preparations said to contain secretin or prosecretin as their active ingredient.
A report giving the reasons for the rejection of one (the first of the
so-called secretin preparations marketed) was published early last year<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> an
article on secretin, based on work undertaken at the request of the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry, is now published<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">30</a></span></p>

<p>Lest the appearance of this detailed study of secretin, after the rejection of
so-called secretin preparations, should be interpreted (as manufacturers whose
products have been rejected have endeavored to interpret such action) as a
case of first condemning a preparation and then getting the facts, the Council’s
methods, and their application in this case, may be briefly stated. The Council
maintains that, when a manufacturer places a product on the market, the burden
of proof is on that manufacturer to show that the properties of his product
are in accordance with his claims for it. As stated in the introduction to
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., “it is <span class="ell">..</span>. manifestly impossible for the Council to investigate
the composition of every complex pharmaceutical mixture, or to check thoroughly
every therapeutic claim; it can give only an unbiased judgment on the
available evidence.” Acting on this principle, the Council examined the claims
made for Secretogen, an alleged secretin product manufactured by the G.&nbsp;W.
Carnrick Company. The conclusion was that these claims were in absolute
conflict with the available evidence as to the action of secretin.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to review this subject again. It will suffice to state that
the claims made for Secretogen rest on two fundamental propositions: (1)
that deficiency of secretin (or, rather, of prosecretin) in the intestinal mucosa
is a factor in gastro-intestinal diseases; (2) that secretin given by the mouth
is absorbed and produces increased secretion of the pancreatic and intestinal
juices and of the bile.</p>

<p>From an examination of the evidence available, including that submitted by
the manufacturers, the Council concluded: “1. No evidence has been presented
that the absence of secretin is a cause of gastro-intestinal disease. 2.
There is no evidence that secretin in any form is physiologically active when
administered by mouth.” That these conclusions were justified is shown again
by the review given by Carlson of the literature, much of which was also
reviewed in the Council’s previous report.</p>

<p>Since the claims of the Carnrick Company were not supported by any
satisfactory evidence, no further investigation on the Council’s part was necessary
to warrant rejection of the product. The Council did not undertake to
determine, for instance, whether or not Secretogen and similar products actually
contain secretin; the determination of this point was immaterial here, in view of
the conclusiveness of the evidence that secretin given by mouth has no physiologic
action.</p>

<p>Since firms other than the G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company are manufacturing
alleged secretin preparations, and since recommendations for the use of secretin
preparations in gastro-intestinal diseases have even crept into textbooks, it
seemed desirable to obtain further information on certain points. The Council
therefore requested Prof. A.&nbsp;J. Carlson of the University of Chicago to check
<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>the results of previous investigators with regard to the action of secretin
administered by mouth or directly into the intestine, and, in addition, to investigate
the secretin content of certain alleged secretin preparations.</p>

<p>Carlson and his co-workers, like all previous investigators, found that
secretin given by mouth, or introduced even in enormous doses directly into
the intestine, is entirely inactive. They also found that marked destruction of
secretin followed contact for one minute with human gastric juice and that
secretin is rapidly oxidized and rendered inert in contact with the air.</p>

<p>Further, they were unable to demonstrate the presence of secretin in samples
of Secretogen and another supposed secretin preparation (Duodenin) bought
on the open market. In the case of Secretogen there was one exception: one
bottle was found which contained a little secretin, but it was necessary to
administer (by intravenous injection, of course) the entire contents of the
bottle (100 tablets) to obtain “a small but unmistakable secretin reaction.”</p>

<p>In these studies the methods employed were those by which secretin was
discovered. It is only by the use of such methods that the presence or absence
of secretin can be determined. Apparently the manufacturers who place so-called
secretin preparations on the market do not make use of these methods,
by which alone even the composition of their products can be determined.</p>

<p>Carlson and his collaborators conclude:</p>

<p>“There is as yet no reliable evidence that lack of secretin is a primary or
important factor in any disease. Even should this be established, secretin
therapy, to be effective, must be intravenous. Secretin has not yet been prepared
in sufficiently pure state to render possible intravenous injection in man
without injurious effects. And even when this is attained, the very fleeting
action of secretin will in all probability render secretin therapy as futile in
all the diseases in which it is theoretically indicated as epinephrin therapy is
in Addison’s disease.”</p>

<p>In short, secretin is as ineffective taken by mouth as it would be rubbed
on the skin.</p>

<p>The referee recommends that the work of Professor Carlson be endorsed.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>HAS SECRETIN A THERAPEUTIC VALUE?&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_B_32" id="FNanchor_B_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_32" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><a name="FNanchor_C_33" id="FNanchor_C_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_33" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></h3>

<p>It is well established that acid chyme in the duodenum is the normal stimulus
to the secretion of pancreatic juice<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_31_34" id="FNanchor_31_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_34" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Interaction of the acid with the duodenal
mucosa liberates into the blood stream a substance which, circulating through
the pancreas, excites the latter to activity. This exciting substance has been
termed “secretin.” It can be prepared artificially by macerating duodeno­jejunal
mucosa in 0.4 per cent. hydrochloric acid, neutralizing the boiling mixture, and
filtering. A few cubic centimeters of the filtrate injected into a vein produce
invariably a powerful secretion of pancreatic juice<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_32_35" id="FNanchor_32_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> That a “chemical messenger”
is at the basis of the duodenal acid reflex has been proved by even
more crucial experiments&mdash;transfusion (Wertheimer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_33_36" id="FNanchor_33_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_36" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> Enriquez and <span class="nowrap">Hallion<a name="FNanchor_34_37" id="FNanchor_34_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_37" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>),
<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>cross circulation (Fleig<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_35_38" id="FNanchor_35_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_38" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> <span class="nowrap">Matuso<a name="FNanchor_36_39" id="FNanchor_36_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>), and perfusion of the isolated pancreas
(<span class="nowrap">Huston<a name="FNanchor_37_40" id="FNanchor_37_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_40" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>).</p>


<h5>PROPERTIES OF SECRETIN</h5>

<p><i>Prosecretin.</i>&mdash;Secretin is soluble in water, yet a watery extract of intestinal
scrapings is without action<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> even after being submitted to acid treatment<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_38_41" id="FNanchor_38_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_41" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
Starling therefore holds that secretin exists in the intestinal mucosa in an
inactive form, as “prosecretin.” The content of the intestine in prosecretin
decreases from the duodenum down, so that one is unable to demonstrate any
prosecretin in the last 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> feet of the ileum. Prosecretin is insoluble in water,
acetone, absolute alcohol or ether. Secretin, on the other hand, is readily
soluble in water, normal salt solution and diluted alcohol (70 per cent.), but
likewise insoluble in absolute alcohol and ether.</p>

<p><i>Preparation.</i>&mdash;All of the more dissociated acids liberate secretin from
intestinal mucosa on boiling. Their action is dependent on the degree of dissociation<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_39_42" id="FNanchor_39_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_42" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>
carbonic and boric acids being inactive<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_40_43" id="FNanchor_40_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_43" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> Secretin can also be
prepared with strong soaps (from 10 to 30 per cent. sodium oleate), alcohol
(70 per cent.<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_41_44" id="FNanchor_41_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_44" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> 0.6 per cent. sodium <span class="nowrap">chlorid<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>). The acid and soap in the duodenum
produce secretion; there is no necessary correspondence between the
action of a substance in the intestine and that obtained by injection after boiling
mucosa with it. The sodium chlorid, bile, maltose and glucose produce
some secretion by the latter method yet none by the former<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> On the other
hand, ether, chloral and oil of mustard excite secretion when in the intestine,
but no secretin can be prepared from boiled mucosa by their action. The irritation
of the lining cell has produced the necessary hydrolysis<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_38_41" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> In well-controlled
experiments, Wertheimer and <span class="nowrap">LePage<a name="FNanchor_42_45" id="FNanchor_42_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_45" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> found that after the introduction
of acid, secretion is secreted into the lumen of the intestine. <span class="nowrap">Matuso<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>
confirmed their results, and found this a satisfactory method for the preparation
of secretin. It is said that secretin can be obtained by merely boiling the
mucosa with water, but the results are inconstant<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_43_46" id="FNanchor_43_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_46" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p><i>Action.</i>&mdash;Secretin is an excitant not only of the pancreatic juice but also
of the liver and the intestinal mucosa. The flow of bile is markedly accelerated
(Henri and Portier<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_44_47" id="FNanchor_44_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_47" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> Enriquez and <span class="nowrap">Hallion<a name="FNanchor_45_48" id="FNanchor_45_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_48" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>), likewise that of succus
entericus (Delezenne and Frouin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_46_49" id="FNanchor_46_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_49" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> Bottazzi and <span class="nowrap">Gabrielli<a name="FNanchor_47_50" id="FNanchor_47_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_50" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>), and intestinal
peristalsis is stimulated (Enriquez and Hallion<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_48_51" id="FNanchor_48_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_51" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> <span class="nowrap">Falloise<a name="FNanchor_49_52" id="FNanchor_49_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_52" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>). Injections of
secretin produce a marked vasodilatation, but the secretory effect is independent
of the blood pressure changes. The pancreas is not readily fatigued by secretin.
Bayliss and <span class="nowrap">Starling<a name="FNanchor_50_53" id="FNanchor_50_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_53" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> have obtained undiminished flow after eight hours of
continuous injection. Our experience confirms this result. Also, equal doses
of secretin give corresponding results at various intervals. Moreover, anesthesia
does not affect the flow. Secretin is unrecoverable from the glands even
<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>after two hours of continuous injection<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_51_54" id="FNanchor_51_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_54" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> The juice obtained by secretin has
been subject to many studies<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_52_55" id="FNanchor_52_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_55" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> It is of high alkalinity (about seventh normal),
contains all the pancreatic ferments, and corresponds in all respects to the
juice obtained in digestion from permanent pancreatic fistulas<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_53_56" id="FNanchor_53_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_56" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p><i>Specificity.</i>&mdash;In a maceration of the duodeno­jejunal mucosa, such as we
have in secretin, the known substances are proteoses and peptones, acid amins,
bile salts, beta-imidazol­ethylamin, cholin, gelatin and inorganic salts. These
substances, individually and severally, together with their derivatives, are devoid
of secretory action. Chemically, secretin, is then a specific entity. But like
epinephrin, in its distribution, it is nonspecific. Active preparations have been
made from an extraordinary variety of animals among the different classes
of vertebrates (Camus<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_54_57" id="FNanchor_54_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_57" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> Bayliss and Starling<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_55_58" id="FNanchor_55_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_58" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> <span class="nowrap">Chapman<a name="FNanchor_56_59" id="FNanchor_56_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_59" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>). It is likewise
found in the new-born and in the fetus<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_57_60" id="FNanchor_57_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_60" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Its action, however, like its chemical
composition, is markedly specific. It stimulates the flow of pancreatic
juice, bile and succus entericus. Its effect on the gastric glands is negative, and
on the saliva likewise<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_58_61" id="FNanchor_58_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_61" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> On the other hand, no other extracts produce pancreatic
secretion. Dr. Koch, who, in collaboration with Dr. Keeton and Dr.
Luckhardt, has done the most recent work on <span class="nowrap">gastrin<a name="FNanchor_59_62" id="FNanchor_59_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_62" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> (a substance that most
nearly resembles secretin) and has isolated an extremely active preparation,
finds that gastrin injection has likewise no effect on the pancreas. Camus and
Gley<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_60_63" id="FNanchor_60_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_63" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> with crude preparations, had previously obtained a similar result.</p>

<p><i>Lability.</i>&mdash;Neutral secretin is but feebly attacked by a temperature of 100
C. If heated in an autoclave (so as to prevent oxidation), this temperature can
be continued for thirty minutes without any change in its activity. Increasing
the temperature increases the speed of destruction, so that at 140&nbsp;C. the
destructive action is marked<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_61_64" id="FNanchor_61_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_64" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> Autoclaving at 15 pounds for fifteen minutes, as
an ordinary sterilization of culture mediums, produces, we found, a distinct
though not serious decrease in activity. Secretin acidified to fifth-normal with
hydrochloric acid loses 60 per cent. of its activity on fifteen minutes boiling.
Secretin, alkalinized to fifth-normal with sodium hydroxid loses 95 per cent. of
its activity in five minutes’ boiling; decreases to a trace in thirty minutes, and
disappears entirely in sixty minutes. At room temperature, with fifth-normal
alkalinity, 80 per cent. of secretin is destroyed in eight hours<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_61_64" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> The destruction
probably means a secondary cleavage of the secretin molecule itself.</p>

<p>Secretin is oxidized readily. If left standing uncovered for a summer’s
day, the preparation will be inactive<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_51_54" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> Even if kept in the ice-chest (no other
precaution being taken), its activity is lost in a very few days. Sunlight
undoubtedly hastens the oxidative process. If care is taken as to sterility,
however, and the secretin is kept in the ice-chest, well stoppered and in a
dark flask, it will retain its activity for several weeks.</p>

<p>Dixon and <span class="nowrap">Hamill<a href="#Footnote_51_54" class="fnanchor"><ins title="Transcriber’s note: originally incorrectly referenced to Footnote 41">51</ins></a></span> claimed that secretin disappears quantitatively on
passage through a Berkefeld filter at 5&nbsp;mm. pressure. Lalou<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_62_65" id="FNanchor_62_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_65" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> using higher
<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>pressure, was unable to confirm the finding, but obtained a marked decrease
in activity. Our results are in accord with those of Lalou.</p>

<p><i>Analogy to Epinephrin.</i>&mdash;The analogy of secretin to epinephrin does not
generally receive enough emphasis. Both substances are nonspecific in distribution,
but specific chemically, and especially physiologically, epinephrin acting
on the myoneural junctions, secretin on intestinal digestion. They are both
relatively simple substances of low molecular weight, and subject to rapid
oxidation whereby their properties disappear. The action in both cases is very
transient. They are the two examples of what Starling calls the “acute
hormones,” in which it is essential that reaction take place immediately, and
shall disappear as soon as the exciting cause is removed<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_63_66" id="FNanchor_63_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_66" class="fnanchor">63</a></span></p>


<h5>CLINICAL USE OF SECRETIN</h5>

<p><i>Diabetes Mellitus.</i>&mdash;Moore, Edie and <span class="nowrap">Abram<a name="FNanchor_64_67" id="FNanchor_64_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_67" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> were the first to suggest a
therapeutic value for secretin, having obtained favorable results with secretin
administration in diabetes. They argued that the internal secretion of the
pancreas <i>may</i> be stimulated by secretin, and that some cases of diabetes <i>may</i>
be due to lack of this necessary excitant. Owing to the importance of the
question, their announcement was followed quickly by numerous investigations
by other observers. Previously, Spriggs, at the suggestion of Starling, had
tried intravenous injections of secretin free from depressor substance in a
diabetic patient, and had obtained negative results. Moore, Edie and Abram
gave their secretin by mouth over long periods. Of the five cases cited in their
first paper, two were negative. The third was that of a man, aged 25, who
received daily 30&nbsp;c.c. of secretin. After a latent period of three weeks, the
sugar suddenly fell, and after four months the urine was sugar-free. Six
months later a relapse occurred with the development of phthisis and death.
The other two patients were a boy, aged 7, and a girl, aged 9, whose urine in
from three to five weeks became sugar free during the secretin treatment in
spite of severe diabetes. One of these patients later relapsed<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_65_68" id="FNanchor_65_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_68" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> Bainbridge and
<span class="nowrap">Beddard<a name="FNanchor_66_69" id="FNanchor_66_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_69" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> gave secretin a thorough trial in three cases with negative results,
and are disposed to attribute the results of Moore to dieting. Dakin and
<span class="nowrap">Ransom<a name="FNanchor_67_70" id="FNanchor_67_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_70" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> cited one case, secretin being given for twelve weeks, with negative
results; Foster<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_65_68" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> nine cases, all negative; Charles<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_68_71" id="FNanchor_68_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_71" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> three cases, all negative.
Crofton<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_69_72" id="FNanchor_69_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_72" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> however, gave secretin a trial in one case with favorable results.
Moore, Edie and Abram, in a later paper<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_70_73" id="FNanchor_70_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_73" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> report a large number of cases tried
with the majority of results negative, though in some cases an improvement
in the digestion, and in certain cases an increase of weight was noted.</p>

<p>One method of testing the basis of Moore’s theory would be by examining
the prosecretin content of the intestine in diabetics. Bainbridge and Beddard
found, in the paper referred to<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_66_69" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> that from five of the six cases of diabetics
examined postmortem, little or no secretin could be prepared; but in a subsequent
report of seven cases<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_71_74" id="FNanchor_71_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_74" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> they found only one in which the secretin
obtained was scanty. The failure to obtain secretin in some cases they claim
is probably due to the rapid postmortem degeneration of diabetic tissue.
Evans<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_72_75" id="FNanchor_72_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_75" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> in Starling’s laboratory, found that in dogs made recently diabetic by
total pancreatectomy, but little secretin could be obtained. Hedon and
<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>Lisbonne<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_73_76" id="FNanchor_73_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_76" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> and Pemberton and <span class="nowrap">Sweet<a name="FNanchor_74_77" id="FNanchor_74_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_77" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> report, on the contrary, that the duodenum
of diabetic dogs is rich in prosecretin. Bainbridge and Beddard<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_71_74" class="fnanchor">71</a></span>
working on a diabetic cat, likewise found prosecretin to be present in normal
quantity.</p>

<p><i>Digestive Disturbances.</i>&mdash;Secretin for digestive disturbance was first used
in the “acid duodenal medication” of Enriquez<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_75_78" id="FNanchor_75_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_78" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> This consisted in the giving
of tartaric acid in thick keratin capsules, the acid not being liberated until the
duodenum was reached, where it provoked the formation of secretin. “The
secretin mechanism,” he says, “is probably capable of pathologic disturbance
as would result, for example, with diminished acidity of chyme, disturbance of
the normal motility of the stomach or pylorus, or diminished prosecretin in the
mucosa. Such a condition would produce disturbance of the pancreatic, biliary
and intestinal secretions, and interfere with intestinal movements, with a
clinical syndrome of intestinal dyspepsia as a result, among the chief and
most constant symptoms of which would be constipation.” “The acid duodenal
medication” was submitted to wide clinical use, and very favorable results in
certain obstinate cases of constipation were reported. In regard to “diminished
prosecretin in the mucosa,” <span class="nowrap">Wentworth<a name="FNanchor_76_79" id="FNanchor_76_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_79" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> has claimed that in infantile atrophy
such is the condition, but Sweet and <span class="nowrap">Pemberton<a name="FNanchor_77_80" id="FNanchor_77_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_80" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> have found that the difficulty
of preparing secretin from human duodenums is such as to render Wentworth’s
findings inconclusive.</p>

<p>Beveridge<a name="FNanchor_78_81" id="FNanchor_78_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_81" class="fnanchor">78</a> suggests the use of secretin in (<i>a</i>) pyloric stenosis, (<i>b</i>) pancreatic
insufficiency, (<i>c</i>) hepatic stimulation and cirrhosis of the liver (<i>d</i>) to
stimulate peristalsis in colonic stasis, (<i>e</i>) in gastro-enterostomy and short-circuiting
of the intestines. He claims to have used it in over a hundred cases
with “brilliant results,” and cites four typical histories. The G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick
Company, which manufactures “Secretogen,” an alleged secretin preparation,
cites a number of <span class="nowrap">authorities<a name="FNanchor_79_82" id="FNanchor_79_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_82" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> as also recommending secretin for digestive
disorders. Harrower, who is or was connected with the Carnrick Company,
in clinical <span class="nowrap">journals<a name="FNanchor_80_83" id="FNanchor_80_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_83" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> has ardently advocated the use of secretin for a large
number of maladies.</p>


<h5>PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS</h5>

<p>Throughout its clinical use, secretin has been given by mouth; <i>but its direct
introduction into the intestine of a dog under anesthesia in even enormous
quantities is without effect</i>. This fact, first observed by Bayliss and Starling<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>
was confirmed by Fleig<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_81_84" id="FNanchor_81_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_84" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> and Matuso<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> and our personal experiments have
convinced us of its truth. Matuso found that ordinary secretin and that
obtained from intestinal lumen gave equally negative results. Large quantities
of active secretin, moreover, acidified to 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric acid, and left
in the ileum for fifteen minutes, were still negative. Wertheimer and Duvillier<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_82_85" id="FNanchor_82_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_85" class="fnanchor">82</a></span>
in a previous paper on this subject, had likewise found that acid solutions of
secretin (which might be considered more normal for the intestine than when
neutral), when introduced into the ileum gave negative or inconstant results.
<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>They conclude that it is more likely that the pancreas does not respond to
such minimal stimuli, than that the secretin is not absorbed.</p>

<p><i>The destructive action of the digestive enzymes leads us to believe that it
is in inactive form that secretin is absorbed.</i> Like epinephrin, it cannot pass
through the digestive tract. Bayliss and Starling state that it is destroyed by
one hour’s tryptic digestion. <span class="nowrap">Lalou<a href="#Footnote_62_65" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> worked with the action on secretin of
pepsin, dog’s gastric juice, pancreatic juice, succus entericus and erepsin, and
found in each case a destructive effect, even almost after mixing; and after
five minutes over 75 per cent. of the activity had disappeared. <span class="nowrap">Matuso<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> introduced
30&nbsp;c.c. of active secretin into the intestine, removed it five minutes later,
and found that no activity remained.</p>

<p>Other methods of administration have been tried. Subcutaneous injections
are practically negative (Matuso<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_36_39" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> <span class="nowrap">Hallion<a name="FNanchor_83_86" id="FNanchor_83_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_86" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>) and intrapleural injections are
likewise negligible (Bayliss and <span class="nowrap">Starling<a href="#Footnote_55_58" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>).</p>

<p>Starling<a href="#Footnote_63_66" class="fnanchor">63</a> finds that continued intravenous injections of secretin in a healthy
dog produces after a time severe symptoms of collapse, which, he believes, are
due to change in the intestinal mucous membrane caused by the entry and
non-neutralization of the strongly alkaline pancreatic juice.</p>

<p>Intestinal digestion seems little affected in achylia gastrica (Stockton<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_84_87" id="FNanchor_84_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_87" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>
Ehrman and Lederer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_85_88" id="FNanchor_85_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_88" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> Bayliss and Starling<a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">32</a>). This may be due to other
secretin stimulants as fats, or to the action of the nervous mechanisms
(<span class="nowrap">Meltzer<a name="FNanchor_86_89" id="FNanchor_86_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_89" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>).</p>


<h5>THE DESTRUCTION OF SECRETIN BY HUMAN GASTRIC JUICE</h5>

<p>We have carried out in detail experiments on the digestive effect of human
gastric juice on secretin. Our results in every respect confirm the findings of
Lalou<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_62_65" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> who worked with commercial pepsin and dog’s gastric juice, but are
even more striking because of the much superior quality of pure human gastric
juice.</p>

<p><i>Methods.</i>&mdash;The human gastric juice was obtained from Mr. V., the gastric
fistula case of our laboratory. The chemical and digestive characters of his
juice are discussed in a recent paper<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_87_90" id="FNanchor_87_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_90" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> In the different experiments, different
samples of gastric juice were used. The secretin employed was always freshly
prepared. Digestion was carried out in the incubator at 38&nbsp;C. with the reaction
of 0.4 per cent. acid, and the end of the period was marked by either boiling
the mixture or (in the first two experiments) by turning the mixture alkaline.
The action of the preparation, we proved, was not influenced by the method
used. The dogs on which the preparations were tested were prepared for carotid
blood pressure, injection into the external jugular vein, and cannula in the
pancreatic duct, essentially the methods of Bayliss and <span class="nowrap">Starling<a href="#Footnote_32_35" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> being
employed. The preparations were injected at body temperature after being
neutralized and filtered. Except for the addition of normal salt solution instead
of gastric juice, the control injections of secretin were submitted to exactly the
same treatment as the other preparations.</p>

<p><i>Results.</i>&mdash;Our results are embodied in Table 1. We assured ourselves
before beginning the series that incubation of secretin with <i>boiled</i> gastric
juice produced no change. It is to be noted in the table that each experiment
is a unit complete in itself, beginning and ending with a control injection of
secretin. <i>Special attention is called to the marked destruction that follows
<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>contact of human gastric juice with secretin for merely one minute.</i> In Experiment
4, using 1&nbsp;c.c. of human gastric juice, the action fell to 14 drops from an
original secretion of 21; in Experiment 5, using 8&nbsp;c.c. of gastric juice, the
action fell to 6 drops from an original secretion of 20. Of interest also is the
rate at which we get <i>complete</i> destruction of secretin. This is practically 2
hours for 2&nbsp;c.c. with secretin giving originally 110 drops (Experiment 2, Fig.
1), or 30 minutes for 5&nbsp;c.c. with a secretin giving originally 53 drops (Experiment
6). These results are practically parallel, though they were obtained
with different samples of gastric juice and in different experiments.</p>

<p>We also tried the effect of keeping the digestive time <i>constant</i> and varying
the amount of gastric juice employed. Increasing the quantity of gastric
juice used increases the quantity of secretin destroyed (Table 2).</p>

<p class=" ml2em fs85">* The digestive time was kept constant at fifteen minutes. (The gastric juice used had
been <i>diluted</i> with stomach washings.)</p>

<p>The reader will observe in Table 1 that the results obtained from the
control injection of secretin at the beginning of the experiment is uniformly
greater than that obtained after several injections of digested secretin.</p>

<p>In view of the established fact that equal quantities of secretin can generally
be relied on to produce results<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_62_65" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> one might suggest that the injections of the split
products of secretin have inhibited to some degree the action of the pancreas.
We can submit the data in Table 3 in support of this view, showing among
other things that the action of secretin is not influenced by previous injections
of inert depressor substances, though it by the injection of the cleavage
products of secretin. (The various injections in the experiments were made
at about fifteen-minute intervals).</p>

<p>We have carefully analyzed the reaction in blood pressure that follows the
injection of the various preparations. We find no constant effect. Digested
secretin gives a fall in blood pressure that is at times less, at times equal, and
at other times greater (Fig.&nbsp;1) than that produced by the original preparation.</p>

<p>Besides the bearing that it has on <i>the therapeutic use of secretin</i>, this
destructive action of the digestive enzymes is also of prime physiologic interest.
Failure to realize it has led to misconceptions as to the intrinsic nature of
secretin.</p>

<p>The findings of Lalou, confirmed by us, explain the anomaly that has led
<span class="nowrap">Delezenne<a name="FNanchor_88_91" id="FNanchor_88_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_91" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> to put forward the antisecretin theory.</p>


<h5>SECRETIN HAS NO ACTION WHEN GIVEN BY MOUTH</h5>

<p>It is a constant claim that so many and complex are the factors concerned
in physiologic processes, that it is not unusual for clinical deductions to establish
themselves in the face of <i>a priori</i> laboratory dicta. We considered it
desirable, therefore, to test the action of secretin, orally administered, in the
most direct manner, and the one freest from possible criticism. With this in
view, we performed a series of experiments on normal unanesthetized dogs
having permanent pancreatic fistulas.</p>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;In the operations for permanent pancreatic fistulas we followed
closely the technic developed by Pawlow<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_89_92" id="FNanchor_89_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_92" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> and with excellent results. The
dogs maintain themselves in splendid condition if proper care is taken. This
consists in feeding them only with bread and milk, and giving sodium bicarbonate
daily. The dogs were given this treatment in the evening so that
experimental procedure might be carried on in the day with empty stomach
under constant conditions. Freshly prepared secretin in large quantities was
given by stomach tube to these dogs, and the response of the pancreas studied
and compared with the response obtained from control preparations. The
same preparation was generally not given on consecutive days.</p>

<p><i>Results.</i>&mdash;We have data from six dogs with a total of seventy-six experiments.
As shown in Table 4, the administration of secretin causes an increase
in the flow of pancreatic juice, <i>but</i> the administration of inert substances as
<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>extracts of colon, gastric mucosa or muscle causes a like increase. The activity
of the secretin may be reduced to a low value by exposure to sunlight, or
filtering through a Berkefeld filter, yet the response of the pancreas is not
correspondingly reduced. The secretion that occurs in the control cases, every
one will admit, is but secondary to the production of gastric juice with its
accompanying hydrochloric acid, that is, excited by virtue of the extractives
and water in the preparations. Such, we can prove, is the only action of
secretin. A mixture of gelatin, peptone and salt water, the chief incidental
constituents of a secretin preparation, gives as striking results as ever obtained
from secretin administration. Yet the objection may be made that the
response of the pancreas that is due to the incidental constituents of secretin
is maximal, and that the secretin consequently has no opportunity to display
its particular potency. But, as inspection of the accompanying tables illustrate,
the administration of hydrochloric acid shows that the response is by no
means maximal. Let us cite a striking experiment. For three hours before
the administration of hydrochloric acid, the secretion in cubic centimeters was
respectively 29.4, 11.75 and 35.4&nbsp;c.c.; for the three hours after, respectively 88.0,
49.0 and 40.5&nbsp;c.c.<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span></p>

<p>It is possible by large doses of sodium bicarbonate given shortly before
the administration of a preparation so to depress the stomach that it does not
respond with the usual production of hydrochloric acid. Under these conditions
the administration of secretin is uniformly negative, but the administration
of hydrochloric acid on the contrary still serves to increase the pancreatic
secretion (Table 6).</p>

<h5>COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS OF SECRETIN</h5>

<p><i>Secretogen and Elixir Secretogen.</i>&mdash;The Carnrick Company offers <span class="nowrap">Secretogen<a name="FNanchor_90_93" id="FNanchor_90_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_93" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>
for use in a large number of conditions. The following indications for
the use of the preparation purport to be based on clinical tests covering a period
of several years: dyspepsia, and the indigestions generally, fermentative
disorders, gastric catarrh, flatulence, nausea; pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal
indigestion; gastric secretory deficiencies, apepsia; constipation and hepatic
torpor; intestinal stasis; diarrhea; infantile diarrhea, “summer complaint,”
marasmus, inanition and malnutrition; gastric atony and dilatation; cholecystitis
and gallstones; nephritis, neurasthenia, cachexia and cancer; epilepsy and
high blood pressure. Testimonials are presented as to results in most of these
conditions.</p>

<p>A quantity of “Secretogen” and “Elixir Secretogen” was bought in the open
market, and the preparations were tested on suitably prepared dogs. The
tablets were ground, thoroughly macerated with the solvent used (water, normal
salt solution, alcohol, or 0.4 per cent. hydrochloric acid), and filtered. If
hydrochloric acid was used, the pulverized tablets were boiled with it, in the
manner that secretin is made from duodenal mucosa, and the preparations
neutralized previous to injection. The injections were made in from 15 to
20&nbsp;c.c. of the solvent. All the operations were carried on immediately before
the experiment, and as rapidly as possible, so as to avoid oxidation. The
Elixir Secretogen was injected directly, without dilution.</p>

<p class="tac fs85">* One to three tablets is (according to the label) the therapeutic dose of Secretogen; 4 to
12&nbsp;c.c. the dose of Elixir Secretogen.</p>

<p><i>Results.</i>&mdash;In only one case was a slight response obtained, the others
gave none. Small and large doses were equally inert (Table 7, Figs. 2, 3).
The preparations, though inert, always produced a depression in blood pressure,
sometimes even greater than that caused by active secretin. Among our many
tests, one bottle was found, however, to be a little different from the rest
(Experiment 4). Its entire content, 100 tablets, had been ground and boiled
<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>in 0.9 per cent. sodium chlorid. The extract on injection was found to have
a small but unmistakable secretin reaction, equivalent to about 2&nbsp;c.c. of the
control secretin used. But repeated experiments were unable to duplicate this
result. The “Secretogen” and “Elixir Secretogen” were all supposedly fresh
preparations, the retail drug store informing us that a fresh supply was
obtained from the wholesale house each week.</p>

<p>Secretogen, then, contains practically no secretin, and even if it did contain
secretin, it can have no effect on the pancreas when taken by mouth. The
indications for Secretogen, therefore, are based on false premises, and the
testimonials are worthless.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Duodenin.</i>&mdash;This is a preparation manufactured by Armour &amp; Company,
which purports to be “secretin plus enterokinase.” The claims for this product
are similar to those for Secretogen, but somewhat less sweeping. According
to the manufacturers, “Duodenin (Armour) is recommended in the treatment
of intestinal disorders where an increased flow of pancreatic, hepatic and
intestinal secretion is desired. It is of specific value in proteid digestion on
the theory that secretin and enterokinase stimulate the pancreas and activate
its secretion.”</p>

<p>In regard to both Secretogen and Duodenin, we assume that the manufacturers
have tried to put secretin in them, but have been unable because they
have failed, in all likelihood, to check their methods by physiologic standard­ization.
These firms do not give any details as to the procedure they employed
in their manufacture of secretin. Desiccated secretin of extreme potency has
been prepared by various physiologists<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_91_94" id="FNanchor_91_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_94" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> 1&nbsp;mg. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> grain) of which is active
when given intravenously. It is difficult to conceive that any of these methods
were used in the preparation of Secretogen or Duodenin.</p>


<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>1. Secretin is quickly destroyed by gastric juice and by trypsin.</p>

<p>2. Secretin is not absorbed in active form from the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>3. The presence of secretin or prosecretin cannot be demonstrated in the
commercial preparations “Secretogen,” “Elixir Secretogen” and “Duodenin”
even when the therapeutic dose of the preparations is given intravenously. In
the case of “Secretogen,” intravenous injection of 100 times the therapeutic
dose reveals occasionally an insignificant trace of secretin.</p>


<h5>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</h5>

<p>It is, of course, objectionable that preparations containing no secretin should
be advertised to the medical profession as containing this substance. The more
important blunder, however, consists in the attempt to offer such preparations
for oral administration, because even chemically pure secretin would be
equally ineffective when taken by mouth. There is as yet no reliable evidence
that lack of secretin is a primary or important factor in any disease. Even
should this be established, secretin therapy, to be effective, must be intravenous.
Secretin has not yet been prepared in sufficiently pure state to render possible
intravenous injection in man without injurious effects. And even when this
has been attained, the very fleeting action of secretin will in all probability
render secretin therapy as futile in all the diseases in which it is theoretically
indicated as epinephrin therapy is in Addison’s disease.</p>

<p>But there remains the alleged favorable effect from secretin therapy by
mouth in various diseases in man. It is, perhaps, impertinent for laboratory
<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>men to comment on these clinical results. The ordinary “testimonials” need
not be considered, but we should like to ask the serious worker who thinks he
has actually obtained good results from secretin therapy how certain he is
of the causal relation between the giving of secretin or alleged secretin and
the abatement of the disease.</p>

<p>When a therapeutic measure not only lacks a positive basis in physiology
and pathology but runs contrary to all the well-established experimental facts
in these fundamental medical sciences, is it too much to ask that positive
clinical findings be subjected to more than usual critical analysis before
acceptance? “<i>Clinical tests</i>,” it is said, “covering a period of several years
have proved that neither the condition in the stomach during digestion nor
those in the intestine prevent the secretin from entering intact into the circulation.”
When we meet claims such as this, should we not scrutinize the
“tests” as well as the men who make them?</p>

<p>We are indebted to Dr. J.&nbsp;H. Moorehead for assistance in part of the surgical
work.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 15, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>ARTICLES REFUSED RECOGNITION</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Below appear abstracts of the Council’s action on articles refused recognition
which were not deemed of sufficient importance to require lengthy reports:</p>


<h4>Radio-Rem</h4>

<p>The Radium Therapy Company, Schieffelin &amp; Co., selling agents, submitted
to the Council radium emanation generators called “Radio-Rem Outfits,”
designed to generate respectively 200, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 Mache units
per twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Those who are well informed on the subject of radium therapy are of the
opinion that the administration of small amounts of radium emanation such
as generated by certain outfits is without therapeutic value. It has been stated
that at the Radium Institute of London the minimum preliminary dose is 185
micro­curies (500,000 Mache units), and as many as 555 micro­curies (1,500,000
Mache units) are employed.</p>

<p>In consideration of these facts the Council voted not to accept any radium
emanation generator which produces less than 2 micro­curies of emanation
during twenty-four hours. Accordingly, while accepting Radio-Rem Outfit No.
5, claimed to produce 10,000 Mache units (3.7 micro­curies) and Radio-Rem
Outfit No. 4, claimed to produce 5,000 Mache units (1.8 micro­curies), the
Council voted not to accept Radio-Rem Outfit No. 3, claimed to produce
2,000 Mache units (0.74 micro­curie), Radio-Rem Outfit No. 2, claimed to
produce 1,000 Mache units (0.37 micro­curie), and Radio-Rem Outfit C, claimed
to produce 200 Mache units (0.07 micro­curie).</p>

<p>This report having been submitted to Schieffelin &amp; Co. and their reply
considered, the Council authorized publication of the report. [See also <i>Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</i>, 1916, p.&nbsp;631.]</p>


<h4>Olio-Phlogosis</h4>

<p>A nonquantitative formula which appears on the label of a sample bottle
sent to a physician enumerates the same ingredients except the sodium thiosulphate.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports that no free iodin could be
detected in the preparation.</p>

<p>Apparently, then, Olio-Phlogosis is essentially a skin irritant applied by
means of cotton; it can be expected to be just about as effective as the old-fashioned
cotton pneumonia jacket, used in conjunction with an aromatic
skin irritant, such as camphorated oil or wintergreen or menthol ointment.
The odor may have some psychic effect, and it is possible that some of the
oily matter may be absorbed by the skin. That such small amounts, even if
absorbed, can produce any considerable systemic effect, however, is highly
improbable, and the advice that this preparation be relied on in pneumonia,
pleurisy, peritonitis, etc., is pernicious. In the few cases of pneumonia in
which heat is indicated, the plain cotton pad will usually be found sufficient.
If the physician consider the addition of a skin irritant desirable, it is easy
to select one from the official preparations. It will be far more rational to
do so than to invoke the aid of a mystic name and a complex formula to which
the patient and his family, at least, will be led to give unmerited credit.</p>

<p>The claims made for Olio-Phlogosis are unwarranted; its composition is
complex and irrational, and the nondescriptive but thera­peutically suggestive
name is likely to lead to uncritical use. The Council voted that the product
be refused recognition for conflict with Rules 6, 8 and 10, and that this report
be published.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 19, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE HYPOPHOSPHITE FALLACY</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The introduction of hypo­phosphites into medicine was due to an erroneous
and now discarded theory as to the cause of tuberculosis of which one Dr. J.&nbsp;F.
Churchill of London, and later of Paris, was the promulgator and propagandist<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_92_95" id="FNanchor_92_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_95" class="fnanchor">92</a></span>
This theory was that the so-called “tuberculosis diathesis” was due
to a deficiency of phosphorus in the blood. Believing that the hypo­phosphites,
while nontoxic, were capable of further oxidation in the organism, Churchill
<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>recommended them as the best means of supplying the supposedly lacking phosphorus.
It is now known that tuberculosis is not due to a deficiency of
phosphorus. Of more importance is the fact, now known, that little phosphorus,
if any, is assimilated from the hypo­phosphites&mdash;far less than from
phosphorus compounds of ordinary food<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_93_96" id="FNanchor_93_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_96" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> There is no justification for giving
hypo­phosphites for the sake of their phosphorus content. For various reasons,
however&mdash;partly from force of habit and partly because of the power of
advertising&mdash;many physicians still prescribe hypo­phosphite preparations, and
consequently, they are still included in the Pharmacopeia and in textbooks on
materia medica and therapeutics. They are put out in the form of “specialties”
and of proprietary preparations, and are lauded extravagantly by the manufacturers
of the latter.</p>

<p>Although the overwhelming weight of evidence was against the probability
that the hypo­phosphite preparations are of value as therapeutic agents, the
Council thought it well to investigate the subject. Dr. W. McKim Marriott
of Baltimore was therefore requested to review the evidence for and against
the therapeutic usefulness of the hypo­phosphites and to conduct such experiments
as seemed necessary. His report has already appeared in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span><span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_94_97" id="FNanchor_94_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_97" class="fnanchor">94</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Marriott found that nine observers (Paquelin and Joly, Vermeulen,
Boddaert, Massol and Gamel, Panzer, Delaini and Berg), who endeavored to
test the alleged utilization of the hypo­phosphites in the organism, reported that
there is complete, or practically complete, elimination of hypo­phosphites in the
urine, with little or no effect on the body. Only one experimenter (Patta)
claimed that a considerable amount of ingested hypo­phosphite was retained
in the body; however, he used a method now known to be inaccurate and
made obvious errors in calculation, so that his conclusions were unwarranted.</p>

<p>Since the evidence was even to this extent contradictory, Marriott performed
a series of experiments. The methods of this study and details of
results are described in his paper, in which he also discusses the experiments
of some other observers. Marriott writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“None of the subjects of the experiment [Marriott’s] experienced any effect
whatsoever from the administration of the drug<span class="ell">...</span>. Almost all of the
ingested hypo­phosphite is promptly eliminated unchanged<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“These experiments [Forbes’] demonstrate conclusively that the hypo­phosphites
possess no specific value as a source of phosphorus for the body. This
is not to be wondered at in view of the fact that 85 per cent. of the phosphorus
ingested in the form of hypo­phosphite is excreted unchanged, and there
is no proof that even the remaining 15 per cent. is available to the organism.
It is doubtful if there are any conditions in which the body suffers from lack
of phosphorus. Even should such conditions exist, phosphorus, in the form
that it occurs in the ordinary foods, or as phosphates, is more efficient in supplying
the deficit than hypo­phosphites that must be oxidized before utilization
and which are only about 15 per cent. oxidized, if at all. For example, half a
glass of milk contains more available phosphorus than three large doses of
hypo­phosphites of 15 grains each, as great a dosage as is usually given.</p>

<p>“What, then, is the therapeutic value of hypo­phosphites? There is no
reliable evidence that they exert a physiologic effect; it has not been demonstrated
that they influence any pathologic process; they are not ‘foods.’ If
they are of any use, that use has never been discovered.”</p></div>

<p>In view of the foregoing, it seemed to the Council advisable to examine
the claims under which a few of the proprietary hypo­phosphite preparations are
marketed. The following are representative:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span></p>

<h5>FELLOWS’ SYRUP OF HYPOPHOSPHITES</h5>

<p>No very exact information concerning the composition is furnished by the
manufacturers (Fellows Medical Mfg. Co., New York). They say that the
product</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. contains the chemically pure hypo­phosphites of iron, quinin, strychnin, calcium,
manganese and potassium, agreeably blended in the form of a bland, stable syrup with
a slightly alkaline reaction<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“Each fluid drachm contains the equivalent of 1-64th of a grain of pure strychnin.”</p></div>

<p>The Fellows’ Hypo­phosphites advertising furnishes something like a barometer
of the popular status of hypo­phosphites. In one circular (undated, but,
from certain references contained in it, presumably issued ten or fifteen years
ago) we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is an indubitable fact that the hypo­phosphites have earned the distinction of having
their therapeutic value more completely established than have any other remedial agents<span class="ell">...</span>.
it is only by accepting the current view, which was originally advanced by Mr.
Fellows, that we can satisfactorily account for the incontestable fact that the hypo­phosphites
are of supreme importance in the treatment of a very extensive variety of affections<span class="ell">...</span>.
the hypo­phosphites increase the consumption of oxygen and the elimination of
carbon dioxide. In this manner, they stimulate nutrition and promote constructive metamorphosis<span class="ell">...</span>.
It is now universally conceded that the widespread utility of the hypo­phosphites
is due to the fact that they substantially improve metabolic processes, thus
increasing the disease-resisting capacity of all the tissues.”</p></div>

<p>The circular, continuing, emphasizes the “incomparable phosphorus-contributing
properties” of Fellows’ Syrup, its “extraordinary reconstructive
properties” and “the magnificent results which invariably attend its employment
in the treatment of anemia, chronic bronchitis, chlorosis, neurasthenia,
mollities ossium, delayed union of fractures, rickets, convalescence,” etc.</p>

<p>A circular bearing the copyright date 1914, on the other hand, admits that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The theories for the favorable action of Fellows Syrup of Hypo­phosphites have undergone
several changes.”</p></div>

<p>The same circular further maintains, however, that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the fact has never been challenged that in Fellows Syrup of Hypo­phosphites
we have one of the most efficient, most complete, most all-around tonics and roborants in
the materia medica.”</p></div>

<p>No attempt is made to base this assertion on the therapeutic action of the
constituents. In other words, the old theory, which formed the basis for the
popularity of Fellows’ Syrup, has been thrown overboard, but no substitute is
deemed necessary; the momentum already acquired is apparently regarded as
sufficient to insure its continued sale.</p>

<p>Fellows’ Syrup of Hypo­phosphites is a semisecret, unscientific preparation&mdash;an
affront to sound therapy&mdash;exploited by means of extravagant and misleading
statements.</p>


<h5>SYRUPUS ROBORANS (SYRUP HYPOPHOSPHITES COMP. WITH QUININ,<br />
STRYCHNIN AND MANGANESE)</h5>

<p>Little information concerning this preparation seems to be furnished at
present by the manufacturers, Arthur Peter &amp; Co., Louisville, Ky. According
to an old circular, it contains, in each fluidounce,</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Further, according to the same circular:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Hypo­phosphites are especially useful in all diseases where there is a lack of nutrition<span class="ell">...</span>.
They are the best of all remedies in Rachitis, non-union of fractures, Osteomalacia
and Syphilitic Periostitis.”</p></div>

<p>As for Syrupus Roborans itself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This elegant preparation is <span class="ell">..</span>. the best general tonic and reconstructive known.”</p></div>

<p>The unwarranted therapeutic claims formerly made for it seem to be no
longer circulated. Syrupus Roborans is an unscientific, shotgun mixture.</p>


<h5>SCHLOTTERBECK’S SOLUTION HYPOPHOSPHITES OF LIME AND SODA<br />(LIQ.
HYPOPHOSPHITUM, SCHLOTTERBECK’S)</h5>

<p>The Schlotterbeck &amp; Foss Co., Portland, Maine, the manufacturers, say of
their preparation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This solution contains 30 grains of the combined Hypo­phosphites of Lime and Soda
to the ounce. It contains No Sugar, No Acid and it is Perfectly Neutral.”</p>

<p>“Indications for use.&mdash;Galactostasis, Imperfect Metabolism, Neurasthenia, Nervous Dyspepsia,
Insomnia, Convalescence, Acetonuria, Cyclic Vomiting in Infants, Diabetes, Starvation,
Deficiency of Lime, Mother’s Teeth during Pregnancy, Dentition of Infants, Rachitis,
Furunculosis, Vomiting of Pregnancy, Obesity.”</p>

<p>“Migraine is often caused by conditions for which this Solution is one of the most
satisfactory remedies:”</p>

<p>“In Insomnia due to advancing age, it will often act as a hypnotic<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Of the hypo­phosphites the Schlotterbeck &amp; Foss Company say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If ‘damning it with faint praise’ on the part of some of the leading medical authorities,
or utterly condemning it as useless, on the part of others, would kill a medicine, the
Hypo­phosphites would long since have disappeared as medicinal agents. Negative testimony
in regard to the value of a drug does not settle anything.”</p></div>

<p>Of their own preparation they say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When we get the results that ought to follow the administration of Hypo­phosphites,
we have proved that Schlotterbeck’s Solution enters the system unchanged.”</p>

<p>“This Solution is primarily a blood and nerve tonic and chemical food.”</p></div>

<p>Schlotterbeck’s Solution of Hypo­phosphites of Lime and Soda is a semisecret
preparation marketed under claims that are both unwarranted and misleading.</p>


<h5>ROBINSON’S HYPOPHOSPHITES</h5>

<p>According to the manufacturers, the Robinson-Pettet Company, Louisville,
Ky., each fluidounce of this preparation contains:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>It is claimed to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nutritive, Tonic Alterative. A Standard Remedy in the treatment of Pulmonary
Phthisis, Bronchitis, Scrofulous Taint, General Debility, etc. Stimulates Digestion, promotes
Assimilation.”</p></div>

<p>The declared composition of the preparation is unscientific, and the therapeutic
claims are unwarranted.</p>


<h5>EUPEPTIC HYPOPHOSPHITES</h5>

<p>Nelson, Baker &amp; Co., Detroit, Mich., who market Eupeptic Hypo­phosphites,
call this preparation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A superior combination containing the Hypo­phosphites of Potassium, Calcium, Iron
and Manganese, and the bitter tonics, Quinin and Strychnin, agreeably associated with
natural digestive ferments of the pancreatic secretion. It is thus a general reconstructive tonic<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span><span class="ell">...</span>.
The remedy is of especial value in the treatment of mental and nervous affections<span class="ell">...</span>.
It is indicated in pulmonary tuberculosis, in all wasting diseases, in debilitated
conditions generally and in all exhaustion from over work.”</p></div>

<p>On the basis of the manufacturer’s statement, Eupeptic Hypo­phosphites must
be regarded as a semisecret, unscientific, shotgun preparation, exploited through
unwarranted therapeutic claims.</p>


<h5>MCARTHUR’S SYRUP OF THE HYPOPHOSPHITES COMP. (LIME AND SODA)</h5>

<p>So far as the recent literature and trade package are concerned, no information
as to the composition of this product is furnished beyond what is conveyed
in the name. The advertising for McArthur’s Syrup, like that for Fellows’
Syrup and Peters’ Syrupus Roborans, has been modified as time has passed.
A few years ago it was advertised under such claims as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Has Stood the Test during many years for unequaled efficacy in the treatment
of Tuberculosis<span class="ell">...</span>. Indicated also as a Tonic and Tissue Builder in convalescence
from Fevers, in Nervous Diseases, Rickets, Senile Debility and Bronchitis.”</p>

<p>“Its use is indicated in <span class="ell">..</span>. diseases of the chest, chronic cough, throat affections,
general debility, brain exhaustion, cholera infantum and wasting diseases of children.”</p></div>

<p>At present no definite claims seem to be made for it; the manufacturers
evidently find the magic name of hypo­phosphites sufficient to evoke the spell
for which the advertisement writer’s aid was once sought. A testimonial
contained in a circular which seems to be still used illustrates both the kind
of aura which surrounds hypo­phosphites in the minds of physicians who are
still living in the past, and the kind of logic which has made the reputation
of this and many other equally worthless preparations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Just about six years ago I had a severe attack of La Grippe which almost killed me.
Left me with Asthma (Catarrh) and a severe cough. Did not get out of the house
for three months. Took over a dozen bottles McArthur’s Hypophos.&mdash;came out all right
and since then worked hard, but last Fall took another cold, but worked on, used McArthur’s
Hypophos., am using it now, am on my 12th bottle.</p>

<p>“I have five or six patients whom I have put on McArthur’s Hypophos., but I do
not prescribe the single bottle, but <i>wholesale</i> no less than half dozen bottles. One patient
is on his 24th bottle with orders to get another half dozen and keep it up all winter.
I have given the same order to all (keep it up all winter) and I myself intend to do
the same, for with its use I have lost no time&mdash;rain or shine I am doing my work. I
know what it has done for me and what it is doing for my patients.”</p></div>

<p>It would be hard to find a more characteristic example of the naïve mental
processes of the simple folk who in all good faith write testimonials for worthless
medicines. This well-meaning practitioner (a homeopath, by the way),
because he “came out all right” after an attack of grip, returns all praise to
McArthur’s Hypo­phosphites, which he has taken “wholesale.” Not the faintest
doubt of the validity of his <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> argument seems to glimmer
across his consciousness.</p>

<p>McArthur’s Syrup of the Hypo­phosphites is an irrational preparation. While
its faults are fewer and less glaring than those of some other proprietaries,
the circulation of such a testimonial as the one just quoted is sufficient of
itself to cast suspicion on the product.</p>


<h5>BORCHERDT’S MALT OLIVE WITH HYPOPHOSPHITES, MALTZYME WITH HYPOPHOSPHITES
AND MALTINE WITH OLIVE OIL AND HYPOPHOSPHITES</h5>

<p>These preparations are now described in the appendix to New and Non­official
Remedies. Borcherdt’s Malt Olive with Hypo­phosphites (Borcherdt
Malt Extract Company, Chicago) is said to contain in each 100&nbsp;c.c., 0.64&nbsp;gm.
each of calcium and sodium hypo­phosphites, with malt extract, olive oil and
glycerine. Maltzyme with Hypo­phosphites (Malt-Diastase Company, New
<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>York) is said to contain, in each 100&nbsp;c.c., 0.4&nbsp;gm. each of calcium, sodium and
potassium hypo­phosphites and 0.005&nbsp;gm. each of iron and manganese hypo­phosphites,
with maltzyme. Maltine with Hypo­phosphites (Maltine Company,
Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y.) is said to contain in each 100&nbsp;c.c., 0.64&nbsp;gm. each of calcium
and sodium hypo­phosphites and 0.42&nbsp;gm. of iron hypo­phosphite, with maltine.
Maltine with Olive Oil and Hypo­phosphites (Maltine Company, Brooklyn, N.
Y.) is said to contain, in each 100&nbsp;c.c., 0.6&nbsp;gm. each of calcium and sodium
hypo­phosphites, with maltine and olive oil. In general, no therapeutic claims
are made for these mixtures so far as the hypo­phosphites are concerned. The
addition of hypo­phosphites to such mixtures is irrational and, since it tends
to perpetuate the hypo­phosphite fallacy, detrimental to sound therapeutics.</p>


<h5>THE COUNCIL’S ACTION</h5>

<p>The Council endorsed the conclusions of the work of Dr. Marriott referred
to above, and noted: (1) that the therapeutic use of hypo­phosphites (except
possibly in some cases as a convenient means of administering the positive
element in the salt, as ammonium in ammonium hypo­phosphite or calcium in
calcium hypo­phosphite) is irrational; (2) that the merits of each hypo­phosphite
salt submitted for consideration under the foregoing exception must be judged
individually, and (3) that Fellows’ Syrup of Hypo­phosphites, Peters’ Syrupus
Roborans, Schlotterbeck’s Solution Hypo­phosphites of Lime and Soda, Robinson’s
Hypo­phosphites, the Eupeptic Hypo­phosphites of Nelson, Baker &amp; Co.,
and McArthur’s Syrup of the Hypo­phosphites are ineligible for inclusion in
New and Non­official Remedies, and that Borcherdt’s Malt Olive with Hypo­phosphites,
Maltzyme with Hypo­phosphites, Maltine with Hypo­phosphites, and
Maltine with Olive Oil and Hypo­phosphites be deleted from the appendix of
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. Of these preparations, all are in conflict with Rule 10; Fellows’
Syrup, Schlotterbeck’s Solution, Robinson’s Hypo­phosphites and Nelson, Baker
&amp; Co.’s Eupeptic Hypo­phosphites are in conflict with Rule 6; the Fellows,
Schlotterbeck, and Nelson, Baker preparations are also in conflict with Rule 1.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>PULVOIDS CALCYLATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Pulvoids Calcylates 5 grains was submitted by the Drug Products Company,
Inc., New York, under the following claims as to composition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="p">“When ingested represents the following chemical formulas: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;<table class="inline"><tr><td>OH<br />COO</td><td><img src="images/r-arc15x6.jpg" width="6" height="15" alt="" /></td></tr></table><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;Ca.2H<sub>2</sub>O +
Sr.(C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.”</div>

<p>“Strontium Di-Salicylate 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;grs. and our especially prepared Salt of Calcium and Acid
Salicylic adjusted in such nascent form, that these pulvoids upon ingestion will promptly
form Calcium Neutral Di-Salicylate 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.”</p>

<p>“A combination of Calcium and Strontium Di-Salicylate, in seemingly true chemical
union.”</p></div>

<p>These statements are rather vague, possibly because they are an attempt
to mystify. The product, however, may be assumed to be a mixture (not a
chemical combination) of calcium salicylate and strontium salicylate. The
therapeutic claims made for the preparation are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Superior to ordinary salicylates. Can be taken continuously and indefinitely without
gastric irritation, insuring maximum efficiency.”</p>

<p>“Reports show surprisingly good results, even where the sodium salt fails.”</p></div>

<p>As there is no evidence to show that strontium salicylate, calcium salicylate
or a mixture of the two salts has any advantage over sodium salicylate, these
<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>claims cannot be accepted. The name and the statement of composition are
objectionable in that they do not reveal the identity of the drugs in “Calcylates”
and in suggesting that this preparation possesses radical advantages over salicylates
in other forms.</p>

<p>The Drug Products Company was told that the facts just mentioned
rendered “Pulvoids Calcylates” ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.
The company in its reply objected to the Council’s conclusions, and in support
of its position submitted testimonials from a number of physicians. The reply
of the company embodied no facts or arguments which had not been considered
by the Council’s referee, and the testimonials from physicians contained no
evidence to show that the combination has any real advantage over sodium
salicylate.</p>

<p>The Council therefore declared “Pulvoids Calcylates” ineligible for New
and Non­official Remedies for the following reasons: Unwarranted therapeutic
claims are made for the mixture (Rule 6); the name does not describe the
composition (Rule 8), and the mixture is an unessential modification of an
established remedy (sodium salicylate) (Rule 10).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>SULFURYL MONAL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Sulfuryl Monal is said to be manufactured by Monal Frères, manufacturing
chemists of Nancy, France. It is sold in the United States by George J.
Wallau, Inc., New York City. According to the label:</p>

<div class="center">
<table width="400" class="ml1em" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<col width="23%" /><col width="1%" /><col width="76%" />
<tr><td class="tar pr03" rowspan="4">“Each Pastille</td><td class="tar pt03 pr03" rowspan="4"><img src="images/50x6bl.png" width="6" height="50" alt="" /></td><td class="tal">Contains: Sulfuryl (combined polysulphurets)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal">&nbsp; = 0.35 centigr.”</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal">Liberates: Nascent sulphurretted Hydrogen</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal">&nbsp; = 2 cub. cent.”</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association was
requested to check the amount of available hydrogen sulphid. An original
bottle of Sulfuryl Monal was used; this contained tablets having the taste of
licorice extract and an odor of hydrogen sulphid. The tablets were found to
liberate about 6&nbsp;c.c. hydrogen sulphid to each tablet.</p>

<p>Among the claims made for the preparation are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dissolved by the saliva, Sulfuryl Monal reaches the stomach where, under the influence
of the gastric juice, it generates nascent sulphuretted hydrogen. Professor Albert Robin’s
remarkable researches have proven that it is in the nascent state that drugs produce the
greatest effect with the smallest dose<span class="ell">...</span>. Being thus eliminated by the entire respiratory
tract: the lungs, bronchi and the throat, the sulphurretted hydrogen passes from the interior
to the exterior, that is to say, goes right through these organs which are, as a consequence,
thoroughly cleansed, antisepticized and freed of the pathogenic micro-organisms<span class="ell">...</span>.
Then, again, part of the sulphuretted hydrogen, liberated in the stomach, is eliminated
by the mouth and acts as an antiseptic and disinfectant of the mucous membranes of the
throat and mouth. Hence Sulfuryl Monal is a perfect protective agent against contagious
diseases<span class="ell">...</span>. Numerous clinical tests have demonstrated its real efficacy in diseases of
the throat and of the respiratory tract: laryngitis, pharyngitis, hoarseness, granulations,
tonsillitis, colds, bronchitis, pulmonary catarrh, asthma, emphysema, grippe, whooping cough,
simple and infectious pneumonia, and in the first stage of pulmonary tuberculosis.”</p></div>

<p>The sulphids are practically ignored in modern textbooks. There is a rather
extensive clinical literature on the subject, particularly in connection with sulphur
waters; this, however, offers no good evidence for the therapeutic value
of sulphids. Probably the tradition in their favor is largely due to the old
popular idea that a disagreeable taste or odor is a mark of a good remedy<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_95_98" id="FNanchor_95_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_98" class="fnanchor">95</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span></p>
<p>When hydrogen sulphid is introduced into the body, the small amounts that
appear in the expired air are insufficient for quantitative demonstration and it
is highly improbable that the amount thus excreted has any germicidal action,
or that enough is excreted in the lungs to cause irritation and a reaction. The
claim that Sulfuryl Monal is “a perfect protective agent against contagious
diseases” is unwarranted; the recommendation for its use in “simple and
infectious pneumonia, and in the first stage of pulmonary tuberculosis” is
dangerous and vicious. The Council declared Sulfuryl Monal ineligible for
New and Non­official Remedies and authorized publication of this report.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>.&mdash;With one exception, this product does not appear to be
advertised in medical journals. We find, however, in the gallery of nostrums
that grace the advertising pages of the <i>International Journal of Surgery</i>, that
Sulfuryl Monal has its place. According to an advertisement that has been
running some months in this publication, “affections of the throat and respiratory
organs respond promptly” to Sulfuryl Monal whose “effects are rapid and
certain” even in “incipient tuberculosis.” This pre­posterous pro­nounce­ment is
no worse than many others appearing in the same journal, but it is bad enough
to indicate how uncritical must be the physicians who support&mdash;by sub­scrip­tion
or con­tri­bu­tion&mdash;pub­li­ca­tions that are still debasing scientific medicine.]&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>MARK WHITE GOITER SERUM AND MARK WHITE
IODINIZED OIL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The “Mark White Goiter Serum Laboratories” of Chicago asked the Council
to consider its products “Mark White Goiter Serum” and “Mark White Iodinized
Oil.” The “serum” was claimed to be an “antibody blood serum from a
goat with thyroidosis” while the “Iodinized Oil” was said to contain “about
4 grains of iodin” to “each c.c.” The therapeutic indications for the treatment
were given as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Simple or Exophthalmic Goiter, Hyperthyroidism-dosis, Thyrosis, Thyroidosis, Thyrotoxicosis,
Dementia.”</p></div>

<p>An ampule (2&nbsp;c.c.) of the “serum” is to be injected into the thyroid to be
followed one week later by an ampule (2&nbsp;c.c.) of the “Iodinized Oil.” Repetition
of this “treatment” once or twice a month is advised.</p>

<p>The Council asked for more specific information as to the composition of
the remedies, particularly as to the preparation and nature of the serum; it
also asked for evidence of the therapeutic value of the preparations. In reply,
Mark White wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All that I can say regarding the serum is that it is made from the blood of goats
with thyroid affection, and it has been found that the serum from these goats has antibodies
which control, or has curative effect upon thyroid affections when injected into thyroid
glands of either humans or animals. As to the iodinised oil, it is only an adjunct or side
treatment which is not always used or indicated, and will only be furnished to the physician
for use in case in his judgment his patient needs it. We shall also advise the use of
quinin <span class="ell">..</span>. when indicated<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The Council was referred for further information to a paper by Rachel
Watkins, M.D., published in the <i>Illinois Medical Journal</i>. It is to be noted,
incidentally, that the letterheads used by White in his correspondence bore in
one corner the notation “Rachel Watkins, M.D., Practice Limited to Goiter
and Other Disorders of the Thyroid Glands,” and in the other, “Mark White,
Goiter Research.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>
<p>The information regarding the composition of this goiter treatment, as
furnished in Dr. Watkins’ paper, was to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The medical treatment consists of the administration of a blood serum derived from
a thyrodized goat. Formula: Iodine 0.16 grams [according to a correction by Mark White,
this should read 0.26 gm.], oil 0.25&nbsp;c.c., serum q. s. 1&nbsp;c.c.”</p></div>

<p>This description of the treatment differs from that furnished to the Council
by Mark White in that here the iodin and oil appear to be combined with the
serum. Dr. Watkins’ “formula” implies that the iodin is a routine medication,
thus contradicting White’s statement, which, in turn, is at variance with the
statements made in submitting the treatment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/088.jpg" width="365" height="439" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproductions (greatly reduced) of some of the letterheads used by the
Mark White concern during the past five years.</div>
</div>

<p>The Council does not accept any biologic product until its sale in interstate
commerce has been authorized by the secretary of the treasury in accordance
with the federal law regulating the sale of viruses, serums, toxins and analogous
products. The sale of the Mark White Goiter Serum has not been so
authorized; consequently even if the preparation complied with other rules of
the Council it could not be accepted.</p>

<p>In addition, however, this treatment conflicts with other Council rules. The
statements regarding its composition are indefinite and contradictory (Rule 1);
the evidence presented to support the therapeutic claims is insufficient in itself
and does not appear to have been checked by any disinterested authority (Rule
6). Moreover, the recognized variation in the morphology and pathology of the
<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>types of goiter render it impracticable to treat cases of goiter by any routine
procedure.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was submitted to the Mark White Goiter Serum
Laboratory. In reply, a letter signed “Mark White, V.M.D.,” was received,
which read, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. we hope at some future time to be able to give you more detailed information,
but as you possibly appreciate that we have experienced for some time a demand on the
part of many physicians that we furnish to them our therapy, which necessitates us furnishing
it before all the detailed work has yet been accomplished, and I trust that you will be
so kind as to bear patiently with us until we are better in a position to make a complete
scientific application and report to you.”</p></div>

<p>White wrote further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The serum and iodized oil may be mixed for immediate use, but could not be put
up only separate for the use of the profession and the therapy furnished Dr. Watkins
she mixed as used.”</p></div>

<p>This statement throws no light on the discrepancies in the statements with
regard to the place of the iodinized oil in the treatment, namely: (<i>a</i>) the
original statement that the oil was to be given a week after the serum; (<i>b</i>)
White’s statement (quoted earlier in this report) that the oil “is only an adjunct
or side treatment” and “is not always used or indicated”; (<i>c</i>) the statement
in Dr. Watkins’ paper that the oil and the serum are given in combination.</p>

<p>The Council declared the Mark White Goiter Serum and Mark White
Iodinized Oil ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies and authorized
publication of this report.</p>


<h4>Editorial Note on the Mark White “Serum”</h4>

<p>As some of our readers will remember, on April 26, 1913, <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
called attention to the Mark White preparation which at that time was being
exploited from Denver. The Propaganda Department has in its files a number
of letters sent out from the Mark White concern at various times. One mailed
in May, 1911, on the embossed stationery of “The Mark White Goiter Institute,”
Exchange Building, Denver, was evidently a general letter sent to physicians,
calling their attention to “the most important medical discovery of the age.”
“Dr. Mark White, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania,” said the
letter, had discovered “a simple and harmless remedy” that would cure goiter.
“Because of the desire to preserve the secrecy of this remedy it is given only
at the office here.” It was then suggested that the doctor might send those of
his patients who were suffering from thyroidism to the “Mark White Goitre
Institute.” If he would do so he would be “given a commission of $10, in cases
of the $50 fee with the additional $5 for each $50 increase.” It closed with
some casuistic arguments, presumably for the purpose of overcoming the physician’s
scruples, summing up the matter with the statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No right thinking man will allow a narrow and self-seeking system of ethics to stand
between him and his duty to the sick and suffering.”</p></div>

<p>About 1912 the name of the concern seems to have been changed, for we
have in our files a letter addressed to a layman on the stationery of the “Mark
White Goitre Treatment Company.” According to this letterhead the product
this concern had for sale was “Goitreine” discovered by Mark White, “President
and General Manager.” Mr. White’s letter to the sufferer from goiter
assured him that if he would take “Goitreine” he might “be practically sure of
an immediate and permanent cure.” “Goitreine,” according to White, “has
absolutely and permanently cured 90 per cent.” of all cases of goiter in which
it has been used&mdash;“and the other ten showed remarkable improvement.” It was
efficacious for all forms of goiter and “cannot possibly harm.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span></p>
<p>The person who received this assurance might have had his confidence in it
shaken had he seen a copy of the Denver <i>News</i> for May 23, 1911, in which was
reported a case of collapse and death in a woman following an injection given
in White’s office. The paper stated that the death certificate was signed by
one W.&nbsp;A. Gray and gave “fatty degeneration of the heart and goiter” as the
cause of death. Gray, it seems, was the licensed physician employed by Mark
White to administer “Goitreine”&mdash;if that is what White happened to be calling
his product at that time. For here it may be stated, parenthetically, that
Mark White is not a physician; he is a veterinarian.</p>

<p>In February, 1913, Mark White sent a circular letter to a number of medical
publications with the request that it be printed in full in the next issue,
“to cover one full page of space.” The letter White wanted printed was addressed
to doctors offering to “enter into a copartnership agreement” with such physicians
who would be willing to treat “patients with goiter affections on a 50
per cent. commission basis.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You would be expected to make a cash charge to the patient for the treatment,
remitting on the same day our 50 per cent. to us, when ordering the treatment, giving
the treatment in no cases for less than $50.00.”</p></div>

<p>About the same time that Mark White made this “fifty-fifty” offer, he sent
in an advertisement to be published in the classified column of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>.
At that time he was told his advertisement was not acceptable; we now reprint
it, however, free of charge. Here it is:</p>

<p class="box">“WANTED&mdash;ONE OR MORE PHYSICIANS<br />
&emsp;in each vicinity to administer and represent
our new medical treatment for <span class="lowercase smcap">GOITER</span>. Good
margin of profit. Write for copy of contract.
The Mark White Goitre Treatment Co.,
Denver, Colo.”</p>

<p>In 1914, White moved to Chicago. At least the card which we reproduce
so indicates. At that time, as will be seen, “Dr. Mark White” was “personally
associated” with Peter S. Clark, M.D. According to the same card Dr. F.&nbsp;D.
Paul of Rock Island, Ill., seems to have been his “associate” for that particular
locality. In this connection, it is worth noting that a Rock Island paper, in
one of its issues during July, 1913, devoted a good deal of space to “Dr. Mark
White” who was at that time in Rock Island “directing Dr. Frank D. Paul in
the administering of the treatment.” There was nothing to indicate that this
notice was an advertisement or that the editorial appearing in the same issue
puffing White’s “important cure,” was paid for.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/090.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="" />
<div>When exploited from Denver the Mark White “goiter cure” was advertised in the daily
papers. Here is a photographic reproduction (reduced) of an advertisement that appeared
in the Denver <i>Post</i>, Sept. 1, 1912.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span></p>

<p>Dr. W.&nbsp;A. Gray, who has already been mentioned as White’s associate in
Denver, seems to have been doing business in Illinois some time in 1913 and
a Princeton (Ill.) paper had some uncomplimentary things to say about him.
Finally in July, 1913, this item appeared in a Princeton paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. W.&nbsp;A. Gray, the goiter specialist who operated last winter at Princeton and Walnut
until he became embroiled with Dr. Mark White, a Denver veterinary and originator of the
cure, over a division of the spoils, has opened a goiter institute in Chicago under his
own name. Advertisements of the Dr. Gray Goiter Institute appeared Sunday morning in
the Chicago <i>Examiner</i> and other morning papers. Dr. Gray and Mark White broke off
their relations after their disagreement at Walnut, and Dr. Gray slightly changed the ingredients
of the goiter cure and started off on his own hook.”</p></div>

<p>One of Gray’s advertisements in Chicago newspapers made the claim that
“Dr. Gray’s New Medical Treatment removes the cause of goiter in seven
days.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/091.jpg" width="380" height="245" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (reduced) of the “professional” card used by “Dr. Mark White”
after he came to Chicago.</div>
</div>

<p>The Tulsa (Okla.) associate of “Dr.” White seems to have been Dr. J.&nbsp;H.
Morgan and the Tulsa papers of June, 1914, tell of “Dr.” White’s visit to that
city “for the purpose of instructing Dr. J.&nbsp;H. Morgan in the technique of his
new medical treatment for nervous disorders and goiter.” Some months later&mdash;in
December, 1915&mdash;the following little item appeared in a Tulsa paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Mark White was found guilty in the county court yesterday of practicing medicine
without a license and was fined $50. Doctor White is a goiter specialist.”</p></div>

<p>In September, 1915, Mr. Thomas S. Hogan, the efficient counsel for the
Illinois State Board of Health, instituted action against Mark White for practicing
medicine without a license. The case was tried Oct. 15, 1915, and the
jury, after being out four hours, returned a verdict of “not guilty.” Attorney
Hogan attributes the failure to obtain a conviction to the testimony of Dr.
Rachel Watkins, who said she had a partnership arrangement with White in
carrying on the medical business. It was about this time that Mark White
seems to have issued some new letterheads. These bore in their upper left
hand corner the device “Rachel Watkins, M.&nbsp;D., Practice Limited to Goiter and
Other Disorders of the Thyroid Glands,” while the upper right hand corner
read “Mark White, Goiter Research.”</p>

<p>On Dec. 9, 1915, Rachel Watkins, M.&nbsp;D., of Chicago, read a paper entitled
“A Serum Treatment for Physiologically Defective Thyroids, With Clinical
Reports” before the Stock Yards Branch of the Chicago Medical Society. The
<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>“serum treatment” discussed was Mark White’s “Goitreine” which, in the course
of its checkered career, had lost its original name by the wayside. This paper
appeared in the December, 1915, issue of the <i>Illinois Medical Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Probably emboldened by the ease with which a component part of the
American Medical Association “fell for” a paper exploiting a “goiter cure,”
Dr. Watkins requested that she be permitted to read a paper on the same
subject before the Section on Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the Detroit
meeting of the American Medical Association last June. The request was
refused. Dr. Watkins is apparently no longer connected with White and in
fact has protested against the use of her name by White in connection with
his “goiter cure.”</p>

<p>[After the above was in type and ready for the pages of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
attention was called to the <i>Official Bulletin of the Chicago Medical Society</i> of
Sept. 16, 1916. This <i>Bulletin</i> contained a full page advertisement of the Mark
White “goiter cure.” The advertiser referred to the preparation as having
been “announced to the Chicago Medical Society” and declared it to be “an
ethical therapeutic agent.” Mark White was described as “a medical research
student” but no hint was given that he is a veterinarian. After again emphasizing
that “this therapy is ethically proven” physicians were invited to “visit
our goats when convenient” and the advertisement closed with the modest claim
that “this thyroid therapy has equal curative therapeutic value in these cases
as quinin in malaria.” And this sort of pseudo-scientific claptrap is presented
to a presumably learned profession through its own official Bulletin&mdash;but what’s
the use of commenting!]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 23, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>KORA-KONIA</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Kora-Konia is a “dusting powder” which at present is advertised to the
medical profession through medical journals, circulars, post cards and sample
packages. It is put out by the “House of Mennen,” which sells various toilet
preparations such as talcum powder, shaving soap, etc. On the trade package
is the statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Indicated in the treatment of Acne, Dermatitis, Eczema Intertrigo; in obstinate cases
of chafing, prickly heat, nettle rash, chicken pox, measles, scarlatina and irritations of the
skin; as a soothing absorbent and antiseptic dusting powder and as an umbilical dressing.”</p></div>

<p>While a circular asserts that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Kora-konia is indicated in the treatment of acne, dermatitis, eczema and eczematous
conditions of the utmost severity<span class="ell">,..</span>. eruptive fevers<span class="ell">,..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>What purports to be a physician’s testimonial reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I used Kora-Konia in a new born case of inherited syphilis and the eruption soon
cleared up.”</p></div>

<p>Germicidal powers are claimed for Kora Konia in a medical journal advertisement.
In view of the various claims made and the fact that it is advertised
to the medical profession, the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical
Association was asked to analyze Kora-Konia. This was done and the chemists
reported as follows:</p>

<h5>LABORATORY REPORT</h5>

<p>Kora-Konia is a white powder, slightly greasy to the touch. Qualitative
tests showed the presence of boric acid, zinc, magnesium, a solid fatty acid
and material insoluble in hydrochloric acid containing magnesium and aluminum.
<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>Starch was not found. Quantitative determinations gave the following
results:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Acid-insoluble material (talc)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05 nowrap">48.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Magnesium (Mg<sup>++</sup>) soluble in dilute acid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;1.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Zinc (Zn<sup>++</sup>)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;4.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Stearic acid (impure)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">39.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Boric acid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;3.0&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;1.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From this analysis it is concluded that Kora-Konia has essentially the following
composition:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Zinc stearate U. S. P.</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">44&#8199;&#8200;&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Talc</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">48&#8199;&#8200;&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Magnesium carbonate U. S. P.</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05 nowrap">&#8199;5.0&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Boric acid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;3.0&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Essentially this dusting powder consists of the well-known substances talc
and zinc stearate in about equal proportions to which small quantities of magnesium
carbonate and boric acid have been added. Inasmuch as the claim is
made, by inference at least, that Kora-Konia represents original investigation
carried out “with the cooperation of the medical profession” it should be stated
that the preparation of commercial zinc stearate was described and recommended
as a dusting and toilet powder nearly twenty-five years ago<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_96_99" id="FNanchor_96_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_99" class="fnanchor">96</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing new or original in any one of these substances or in the
combination. The extravagant and unwarranted claims made for this simple
dusting powder are undoubtedly leading the public as well as some thoughtless
physicians, to place undeserved confidence in it. In view of the small amount
of boric acid present in the powder, its antiseptic powers must be slight and
its germicidal powers almost nil. The Council declared Kora-Konia ineligible
for New and Non­official Remedies and authorized publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF THE GLYCEROPHOSPHATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Glycero­phosphates are the salts of glycero­phosphoric acid, H<sub>2</sub>[C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]PO<sub>4</sub>.
This acid is produced by the interaction of glycerin and phosphoric acid.
In general, only sodium glycero­phosphate, Na<sub>2</sub>[C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]PO<sub>4</sub>&#8202;+5<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>H<sub>2</sub>O, and
calcium glycero­phosphate, Ca[C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]PO<sub>4</sub>&#8202;+H<sub>2</sub>O, are used in medicine,
though the glycero­phosphates of lithium, potassium, manganese, magnesium,
iron, quinin and strychnin are claimed as constituents of proprietary preparations.
At a time when certain disorders were assumed to be due to a deficiency
of phosphorus in the nerve structure in the body, glycero­phosphates were introduced
as “nerve foods” and “tonics” on the theory that they would be assimilated
more readily than hypo­phosphites or ordinary phosphates. What led to
this assumption was the fact that the lecithins, which form a part of the nerve
structure, were known to contain the glycero­phosphate radical in the molecule.
The belief that inorganic phosphates cannot supply the body’s need of phosphorus
is implied or expressed in most of the “literature” devoted to proprietary
phosphorus preparations.</p>

<p>Thus, Schering and Glatz quote G. Meillière as saying that “the organism
is incapable of assimilating inorganic forms of phosphorus.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>
<p>Again, when exploiters of glycero­phosphates admit that the body can synthesize
its phosphorus compounds from inorganic phosphates, they attempt to
counterbalance the admission by contending that the use of organic compounds
“spares” the system the necessity of making such synthesis. This assumption
rests on the theory that the organic phosphorus compounds are absorbed and
stored as such.</p>

<p>This theory is contradicted by evidence which has been <span class="nowrap">presented<a name="FNanchor_97_100" id="FNanchor_97_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_100" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> that the
organic phosphorus compounds are split up into inorganic phosphates before
absorption.</p>

<p>The Council requested E.&nbsp;K. Marshall, Jr., to review the evidence for and
against the therapeutic value of organic phosphorus compounds. Marshall’s
<span class="nowrap">study<a name="FNanchor_98_101" id="FNanchor_98_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_101" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> brings out the following points:</p>

<p>1. In various tissues of the animal body, enzymes have been found which
hydrolyze complex organic phosphorus compounds so as to liberate the phosphorus
in the form of inorganic phosphates.</p>

<p>2. Metabolism studies of the phosphorus balance with diets containing
inorganic phosphorus compounds, as compared with diets containing organically
bound phosphorus, are somewhat conflicting in their results. The balance of
evidence, however, is in favor of the view that there is no difference between
organically combined phosphorus and inorganic salts with respect to the phosphorus
balance.</p>

<p>3. Experiments indicate that the organism thrives on and supplies its phosphorus
needs quite as well from inorganic phosphorus compounds as from
organically bound phosphorus.</p>

<p>Marshall concludes:</p>

<p>“We see that the evidence is very convincing of the view that the animal
organism can synthesize its complex organic phosphorus constituents from
inorganic phosphates, and that organic phosphorus is of no more value as a
food than inorganic.”</p>

<p>In view of this report, the Council deemed it advisable to take up the consideration
of certain glycero­phosphate preparations on the market. As the
therapeutic claims are all similar, it is not necessary to quote them extensively.</p>


<h5>TONOLS (SCHERING’S GLYCEROPHOSPHATES)</h5>

<p>Tonols (Schering and Glatz, New York) comprise iron, lime, lithium, magnesium,
manganese, potassium, quinin, sodium and strychnin “Tonols” or
glycero­phosphates; also Duotonol Tablets, said to contain equal parts of
calcium and sodium glycero­phosphates; Triotonol Tablets, each said to contain
“Sodium Tonol 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains, Lime-Tonol 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains, Strychnine-Tonol <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>60</sub></span> grain”;
Quartonol Tablets, said to contain “Sodium and Lime-Tonols, each 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grains,
Quinine Tonol <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain, Strychnine-Tonol <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub></span> grain”; Sextonol Tablets, said
to contain “Sodium and Lime-Tonols, each 2 grains, Iron-Tonol, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain,
Manganese and Quinine-Tonols, each <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain, Strychnine-Tonol, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub></span> grain.”</p>

<p>The name “Tonols” is objectionable in that it is not only nondescriptive
of the composition, but also thera­peutically (and falsely) suggestive. The
composition of the more elaborate Tonols is particularly unscientific; there is
no justification for combining quinin, strychnin, iron, manganese, etc., in one
formula.</p>


<h5>PHOSPHORCIN COMPOUND</h5>

<p>Phosphorcin Compound, called “The Elementary Phosphorus indicated in
all forms of Nervous Diseases” and the “Perfect Formula,” is said to be
<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>manufactured by the Organic Products Company, Wetzlar an der Lahn, Germany,
and Greenwich, Conn. It is sold in the United States by Eimer and
Amend, New York, according to whom:</p>

<p>“Acidulated bone phosphor” presumably is acid phosphate of calcium. This
formula is an unscientific shotgun combination.</p>


<h5>ROBINOL</h5>

<p>Robinol, manufactured by John Wyeth and Brother, Philadelphia, is called
a “Universal Tonic.” It is said to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A preparation of the glycero­phosphates of lithium, calcium, sodium, iron, manganese,
quinine, with 1-16&nbsp;gr. strychnine glycero­phosphate in each fluidounce.”</p></div>

<p>This is a semisecret preparation, since the quantities of most of the ingredients
are not given and the vehicle is not named. This complex combination,
too, is unwarranted.</p>


<h5>PHOSPHOGLYCERATE OF LIME (CHAPOTEAUT)</h5>

<p>This is said to be prepared by the Laboratories de Pharmacologie Générale,
Dr. Ph. Chapelle, Paris and New York. It is sold in this country by E. Fougera
and Co., Inc., New York. It is offered in several forms, especially in that of
wine, which is called the “Medicinal Wine and Tonic Par Excellence.” The
alcohol is no doubt the constituent to which this preparation is indebted for
such popularity as it has attained, for it is much more freely advertised than
the syrup, capsules or granulated form. The usual claims are made with
regard to the efficacy of calcium glycero­phosphate “during convalescence, in
cases of enfeebled vitality, and nervous affections associated with an excessive
elimination of phosphates.”</p>


<h5>ELIXIR GLYCEROPHOSPHATES, NUX VOMICA AND DAMIANA</h5>

<p>This is manufactured by Sharp and Dohme, Baltimore. The manufacturers’
statement of composition is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Each fluidounce represents Nux Vomica 8 grains, Damiana 64 grains, combined with
Glycero­phosphates of Calcium and Sodium.”</p>

<p>“Alcohol 20 per cent.”</p></div>

<p>Sharp and Dohme call this mixture a “Reconstructive Nerve Stimulant,
Aphrodisiac,” and claim that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Phosphorus in elemental form has long been prescribed under the title of Elixir
Phosphorus, Nux Vomica and Damiana, but due to the rapidity of chemical change occurring
in preparations containing this form of Phosphorus, much of the Physiologic action is lost.
The Glycero­phosphates present Phosphorus in its most available form&mdash;the form in which
it exists in the brain and nervous system. They powerfully stimulate the functions of
nutrition and are rapidly assimilated by the system.</p>

<p>“Nux Vomica is a general Nerve Tonic. Damiana exerts a stimulant effect upon the
sexual appetite and function.”</p></div>

<p>The claim that the glycero­phosphates may be substituted for elementary
phosphorus is, at least, novel.</p>

<p>The elixir is an unscientific semisecret combination.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span></p>

<h5>RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>

<p>All of the preparations mentioned violate Rule 6 (unwarranted therapeutic
claims). In addition, Robinol and Elixir Glycero­phosphates, Nux Vomica and
Damiana violate Rule 1 (secrecy of composition) in that not all the quantities
of the ingredients are declared; Tonols, Phosphorcin Compound and Robinol
violate Rule 8 (objectionable names). It is recommended that the Council
endorse Marshall’s <span class="nowrap">findings<a href="#Footnote_98_101" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> and declare that Tonols (Schering and Glatz),
Phosphorcin Compound (Eimer and Amend), Robinol (John Wyeth and
Brother), Phospho­glycerate of Lime Chapoteaut (E. Fougera and Co.), and
Elixir Glycero­phosphates, Nux Vomica and Damiana (Sharp and Dohme) are
ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>HYDRAS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Hydras, sold by John Wyeth and Brother, Philadelphia, is one of the many
proprietary, so-called “uterine tonics.” It is said to contain “Cramp Bark,
Helonias Root, Hydrastis, Scutellaria, Dogwood and Aromatics,” but as the
amounts of the several ingredients are not given the statement regarding its
composition is valueless. The label declares the presence of 24 per cent.
alcohol.</p>

<p>The name “Hydras,” taken in connection with the statement of composition,
would suggest that hydrastis (golden-seal) is an important constituent. The
report of the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association, however,
indicates that hydrastis is present in unimportant amounts:</p>

<p>“The hydrastin content of Hydras was determined by extraction with
immiscible solvents (<i>Pharm. Review</i>, May, 1908, p.&nbsp;132). Twenty-five c.c. was
found to yield an alkaloid residue of 0.0160&nbsp;gm. The preparation contains,
therefore, not more than 0.064&nbsp;gm. ‘hydrastin’ per 100&nbsp;c.c. Inasmuch as hydrastis
is required to contain about 2.5 per cent. ‘hydrastin,’ hydras contains an equivalent
of not more than 2.56&nbsp;gm. hydrastis (golden seal) in 100&nbsp;c.c. and the stated
dose of Hydras&mdash;one dessertspoonful (8 c.c.)&mdash;represents not more than 0.2&nbsp;gm.
or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. average dose of hydrastis.”</p>

<p>The label of a recently purchased bottle of Hydras bears the following
recommendations for its use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Indicated in treatment of Dysmenorrhea, Menorrhagia Anti-Abortive, with anodyne and
tonic properties.”</p>

<p>“For dysmenorrhea, suppressed menses, etc., a dessertspoonful three times daily, before
or after meals.”</p>

<p>“To relieve pain due to uterine disorders, a dessertspoonful every three hours, or
increased to a tablespoonful, at the discretion of the attending physician.”</p></div>

<p>A circular wrapped around the bottle declares that Hydras is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A valuable preparation to the physician in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, colic, cramps,
spasm, palpitation incident to pregnancy, and the various pains resulting from diseases of
the female sexual organs.”</p></div>

<p>It is further claimed that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the dysmenorrhea of young girls due to some mechanical difficulty, as anteflexion
or of a congestive character, of suppressed menses from exposure to cold and other causes
of a similar character, Hydras will prove efficient and can be administered freely without
danger.”</p></div>

<p>The value of hydrastis in the treatment of the diseases and conditions mentioned
is problematical at best, and the small amount present in Hydras is
wholly useless. As for the other constituents, cramp bark (<i>Viburnum opulus</i>),
helonias (false unicorn&mdash;<i>Chamælirium luteum</i> or <i>Helonias dioica</i>) and scutellaria
<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>(skullcap&mdash;<i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>) are drugs which are practically ignored
by most writers on materia medica and therapeutics<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_99_102" id="FNanchor_99_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_102" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> Dogwood (<i>Cornus
florida</i>) is a mildly astringent aromatic bitter for the use of which there is
no scientific evidence<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_100_103" id="FNanchor_100_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_103" class="fnanchor">100</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up: Of the five ingredients of Hydras (aside from alcohol and
aromatics), one (hydrastis), which apparently gives the preparation its name,
is present in unimportant amounts; three (cramp bark, helonias and scutellaria)
are thera­peutically unimportant; the fifth (dogwood) has never been shown to
have any specific action on the uterus. The potent constituent, therefore,
appears to be the alcohol.</p>

<p>But, even if every one of the several drugs said to be contained in Hydras
were possessed of distinct therapeutic properties, and if each were present in
known and thera­peutically active amounts, still the combination in fixed proportion
would be irrational. No one could foresee the joint effect of the five
drugs in the several conditions for which the mixture is advertised. Hydras
is evidently meant to appeal to the thoughtless and to be used at random;
witness the suggestion made in the advertising that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Owing to its palatability, it is acceptable to patients with impaired digestion, and will
serve as a stomachic tonic, promoting appetite and digestion.”</p></div>

<p>A useless alcoholic nostrum “administered freely” to women and girls is
as dangerous as the recommendation for such administration is reprehensible.</p>

<p>This preparation is semisecret. The recommendations for its use in specified
diseases which appear on the label and in the advertising accompanying the
bottle are sure to lead to its ill-advised use by the public. The claims made for
its curative properties are exaggerated and unwarranted. The name, in view
of the small content of hydrastis, is misleading. Finally, the combination of
five drugs, even if individually they were of therapeutic value, is irrational.
Hydras, consequently, is inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies for
conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and publication of this report is authorized.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Comment.</span>&mdash;Products like “Hydras” are the bane of scientific
medicine. The physician who prescribes them could with just as much reason
prescribe any of the various alcoholic “patent medicines” of the “women’s
tonic” type. In fact, his patients would be running less risk of contracting the
alcohol habit if he prescribed the “patent medicines,” as these nostrums
usually have less alcohol than is contained in their “ethical” prototypes&mdash;and
alcohol is the only really important drug in practically all of them. Whatever
one may think of reputable pharmaceutical houses who put out products of
the “Hydras” type, the fault really lies with the profession which tolerates
such therapeutic monstrosities.]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 7, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>BROMIN-IODIN COMPOUND</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>“Bromin-Iodin Compound,” according to the Bromin-Iodin Chemical Company,
San Diego, Calif., has the following “formula”:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span></p>
<p>The only statement regarding its method of preparation is the line “Solution
in Cod Liver Oil, Norwegian.” According to the promoters, “Bromin-Iodin”
is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Powerful Anti-Tubercular Agent for Hypodermic Use in Pulmonary and Laryngeal
Tuberculosis. Useful in other forms of Tubercular Diseases, and in Non-Tubercular Pulmonary
Diseases of a Sub-Acute or Chronic Nature.”</p></div>

<p>The “formula,” in the form in which the manufacturers publish it, is either
impossible or meaningless, according to the interpretation that may be given.
It is impossible if it is intended to indicate the actual composition of the
product because that would mean that the oil is alleged to contain free or
uncombined iodin, bromin and phosphorus. Both on theoretical grounds and
also in the light of the findings of the Chemical Laboratory of the American
Medical Association, it is not possible that all these constituents can be present
in the free state. The formula is meaningless if it is intended to convey the
idea, merely, that iodin, bromin, phosphorus, thymol, menthol and sterilized oil
are combined to form “Bromin-Iodin.” In the absence of any details of the
method of manufacture, it is futile to attempt to pass judgment on the actual
composition of the preparation.</p>

<p>The use of an almost identical product (said, however, to contain only <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>
grain iodin to each fluidram) was described in 1908 by Dr. Ingraham of Binghamton,
N.&nbsp;Y., in “Five Years Successful Experience with a Special Mode
of Treating Pulmonary Tuberculosis.” In 1910 <span class="smcap">The Journal</span><span class="nowrap"><a href="#Footnote_99_102" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> characterized
the preparation as “one of the innumerable ‘treatments’ for pulmonary tuberculosis
that have arisen, had their day and, more or less gracefully, retired.”
If the preparation had value for the purpose for which it is recommended, its
use during these twelve years should have secured its general recognition.
There is no satisfactory evidence of its therapeutic efficacy. The Council
refused recognition to Bromin-Iodin Comp. and, after submitting this report
to the Bromin-Iodin Chemical Company, authorized its publication.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>AMMONIUM HYPOPHOSPHITE OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Ammonium hypo­phosphite was admitted to New and Non­official Remedies in
1908 as a preliminary step in the consideration of a preparation containing it&mdash;“Gardner’s
Syrup of Ammonium Hypo­phosphite”&mdash;because the Council standardizes
unofficial products before considering preparations or mixtures of these.</p>

<p>The therapeutic use of hypo­phosphites being irrational (see, “The Hypo­phosphite
Fallacy,” Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, Sept. 2, 1916, p.&nbsp;760), the salt, ammonium hypo­phosphite, deserves
continued recognition only on condition that this salt of ammonium is superior
to other salts from which may be obtained the effect of the ammonium radical.
It has been claimed that ammonium hypo­phosphite has a less objectionable
taste than other ammonium salts used for similar purposes. This claim would
merit serious consideration if in addition to being less objectionable to the taste,
the effects of ammonium hypo­phosphite were equal to or more desirable than
the official ammonium salts. There is no evidence that this condition is met
by the hypo­phosphite salt.</p>

<p>Ammonium hypo­phosphite has long been known, yet it is not official in the
Austrian, Belgian, British, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Swedish, Swiss
or United States Pharmacopeias. Neither is it mentioned in the leading textbooks
on materia medica, pharmacology or therapeutics. In short it appears
to be an instance of an obscure and superfluous salt selected for proprietary
exploitation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>
<p>Since the continued recognition of ammonium hypo­phosphite would tend to
perpetuate the hypo­phosphite fallacy, and because there is no evidence supporting
its advantage as a means of securing the effect of ammonium salts
the Council directed its omission from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;51.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>ALPHOZONE OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following advertisement appeared in the <i>New Idea</i> (September, 1916),
a house organ of Frederick Stearns &amp; Co., the proprietors of Alphozone:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 290px;">
<img src="images/099.jpg" width="290" height="456" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the light of our present knowledge the claim that Alphozone is a preventive
of infantile paralysis is without warrant and the advice that the public depend
on it for this purpose is reprehensible and dangerous. Therefore, the Council
directed that Alphozone be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;50.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>CALCIUM GLYCEROPHOSPHATE AND SODIUM GLYCEROPHOSPHATE
OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Calcium glycero­phosphate and sodium glycero­phosphate were accepted for
New and Non­official Remedies chiefly in order that these products might be
<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>standardized. These mixtures now being defined in the new edition of the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia, this reason for including them in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. no longer exists.
The report of Marshall (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 13, 1915, p.&nbsp;573) which has the
endorsement of the Council (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Sept. 30, 1916, p.&nbsp;1033) shows that
organic phosphorus compounds are split up into inorganic phosphates before
absorption, that the animal organism can synthesize its complex organic phosphorus
constituents from inorganic phosphates and consequently that the
glycero­phosphates, so far as their phosphorus value is concerned, are not
superior to other phosphates. In fact, sodium and phosphate are more effectively
administered as neutral or acid phosphate. It is evident that sodium glycero­phosphate
is a superfluous pharmaceutical preparation, particularly when the
difficulty of obtaining a pure product and its high price is considered. So far
as its calcium value is concerned, calcium glycero­phosphate has no advantages
over such calcium salts as the carbonate, phosphate, lactate, or chlorid. In
view of the foregoing, the Council directed that sodium glycero­phosphate and
calcium glycero­phosphate be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</i>, 1916, p.&nbsp;52.)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>GARDNER’S SYRUP OF AMMONIUM HYPOPHOSPHITE
OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>In recognition of the considerable revision of the therapeutic claims made
by the manufacturer, Gardner’s Syrup of Ammonium Hypo­phosphite was
retained in New and Non­official Remedies, 1916, and the proprietor advised of
this provisional retention.</p>

<p>In the most recent advertising for this ammonium hypo­phosphite syrup the
claim is made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Besides being an active expectorant Syrup of Ammonium Hypo­phosphite (Gardner)
is useful as an alterative and resolvent and by virtue of its phosphorus element, which is
in the form of a hypo­phosphite, PH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, has a tonic value.”</p></div>

<p>As detailed in the report of the Council “The Hypo­phosphite Fallacy” (<span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 2, 1916, p.&nbsp;760) careful studies show that the hypo­phosphites
are devoid of the “alterative” and “tonic” actions claimed by the
manufacturer of Gardner’s Syrup of Ammonium Hypo­phosphite. Accordingly
the Council voted to omit Gardner’s Syrup of Ammonium Hypo­phosphite from
New and Non­official Remedies and authorized publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;55.</i>)</p>

<h3>GLUTEN PRODUCTS MADE BY THE KELLOGG FOOD
COMPANY</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>For over two years the Council has had under consideration certain products
offered for the use of diabetics by the Kellogg Food Company of Battle Creek,
Mich. These are:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
Pure Gluten Biscuit.<br />
Pure Gluten Meal.<br />
40 per cent. Gluten Biscuit.<br />
40 per cent. Gluten Flour.<br />
40 per cent. Gluten Meal.<br />
20 per cent. Gluten Meal.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span></p>

<p>The Council found these products ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies
because the statements of composition (particularly of starch content)
were insufficient and because the exploitation of the products to the laity was
objectionable. June 21, 1915, the company promised to place a statement of
the starch content on the package of each gluten product, to place on the gluten
flour sacks a caution that diabetics use the flour only on the advice of their
physicians, and to revise its advertising in accordance with the suggestions
of the Council. Nothing further having been heard from the company, in
April, 1916, specimens of the product were obtained, through a layman, direct
from the Kellogg Food Company. These specimens, together with the advertising
matter received at the same time, and also a letter of advice from the
company to another layman, were sent to the Council’s referee, whose report
follows. As will be seen, the referee finds that the amounts of carbohydrates
contained in Pure Gluten Flour, 40 per cent. Gluten Flour and Pure Gluten
Meal are greater than the amounts claimed in the company’s published
analyses; that in the two first mentioned the amounts of protein are less than
the amounts claimed; that exaggerated claims are made on all the labels and
in the advertising literature, and that the company prescribes directly to the
patient.</p>

<p>The following report was sent to the Kellogg Food Company for consideration.
In reply the firm stated that a revision of its advertising was under
consideration but would make no statement as to how soon this revision would
be carried into effect. As the consideration had already consumed two years,
the Council decided to give the profession the facts and authorized publication
of the report. At the same time the Kellogg Food Company was advised that
its products would be considered further whenever any submitted evidence

<h4>Referee’s Report</h4>

<p>I submit herewith my report on certain foods offered by the Kellogg Food
Company for the use of diabetics. I shall discuss these products from the
standpoint of the claims made on the label, from the standpoint of the company
toward nonmedical treatment as revealed in a letter to a layman, and lastly,
on the basis of the claims made for the foods in the company’s literature.</p>

<p>The sample analyzed does not contain the amount of protein claimed for
it. It also contains more starch than one might suspect from the company’s
analysis. A more conservative claim would be “starch less than 5 per cent.”
The company makes the error of using the terms “starch” and “carbohydrates”
as synonymous. If the maximum figures of the company’s analysis are used,
the carbohydrates would amount to 5 per cent., whereas I find 14.84 per cent.
The claim on the label “Guaranteed to contain less than 5 per cent. of carbohydrates”
is incorrect. The next claim, “Each ounce of this gluten contains
23 grams of protein and represents 95 calories” is approximately correct, as
my analysis shows 20.9 grams of protein and 103 calories.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>
<p>The following remarks under “Vegetable Proteins” are in my judgment
exaggerated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Leading authorities are now agreed that meat, fish, eggs and other animal
proteins are greatly inferior to vegetable proteins in diabetes, often increasing
the sugar output and the dangerous acidosis which leads to diabetic coma<span class="ell">...</span>.
After many years of experimentation, we have succeeded in perfecting
a process whereby the carbohydrates are excluded.”</p></div>

<p>In this connection, von Noorden, whom the company constantly quotes, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the slighter forms (of diabetes), the influence of meat albumins is not
great and it is difficult to demonstrate the reaction of the patient to different
forms of albumin. It may be necessary to add more albumin than the patient
can actually take before glycosuria indication is reacted<span class="ell">...</span>. Once a
medium amount of albumin is exceeded, say 70 to 80 grams, the glycosuria
increases, no matter what the type of albumin is.”</p></div>

<p>My analysis also shows that the carbohydrates are not excluded from this
food as claimed above.</p>

<p>No analysis is supplied by the company, but this may be called properly a
“40 per cent. Gluten Biscuit.” The company claims, however, that this is
“Best for Diabetics,” which is not true.</p>

<p>Here, as in the case of “40 per cent. Gluten Flour,” the company’s label
attributes to “Dr. Wm. Osler in ‘Practice of Medicine,’&#8239;” the following quotation:
“Of Gluten Foods, many are very unpalatable, others are frauds. A
Good Gluten Flour is made by the Battle Creek Sanatarium Co., Mich.” I
have no way of knowing to which gluten flour of the company Dr. Osler had
reference. The “Pure Gluten Meal” might be called properly a “good gluten
flour,” but this “40 per cent. Gluten Flour” is no better, and no worse, than
the average gluten flour on the market. The quotation from Osler gives an
entirely false impression.</p>

<p>My analysis shows 6.37 per cent. less protein than the company’s minimum,
and 10.35 more carbohydrates than their maximum. In past years I have
found the protein in this brand to range from 35.0 to 42.9 per cent. (using the
factor 5.7). It is true that the manufacturer does not state what protein factor
is used in his reported analysis, but as in four other brands 5.7 is used, it is
fair to assume that the same factor applies to this as well. At least such
should be the case, as otherwise the manufacturer’s analyses would be meaningless.
Even using the factor 6.25 this later sample contains only 36.88 per
cent. of protein.</p>

<p>The following statement, in my judgment, as applied to a food containing
over 48 per cent. of starch, does not hold water: “This food is of special
<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>service in cases of Glycosuria and in the milder forms of Diabetes.” With
this brand as with “40 per cent. Gluten Biscuit” the manufacturer again uses
the misleading quotation from Osler.</p>

<p>The claimed analysis is justified by my findings. I must take exception,
however, to the following statement: “Prepared with great care from a good
grade of Spring Wheat, by our special process, which preserves the natural
food properties of the product.” The company evidently tries to carry water
on both shoulders, on the one hand claiming a reduction in the starch content,
while on the other claiming the preservation of all “the natural food properties.”</p>

<p>The company’s analysis is confirmed. As the company claims directly that
this is “Not A Diabetic Food,” any criticism of its use for that purpose is
disarmed. However, again exception must be taken to the statement that
“the natural food properties of the product” are preserved.</p>

<p>The minimum claim as to protein is justified. Again the company confuses
carbohydrates and starch, and the food instead of containing from 0 to 5
per cent. of “carbohydrates (starch)” actually contains 16.77 per cent. of carbohydrates,
of which 6.77 per cent. is starch. Once more the statement that “the
natural food properties” are preserved is untrue as applied to a wheat product
deprived of most of its starch.</p>

<p>In justice to the company, it should be noted that on the labels of “Pure
Gluten Biscuit” and “Pure Gluten Meal” appears the warning: “Every person
suffering from diabetes should be under the care of an experienced physician,”
and on the label of “40 per cent. Gluten Meal,” “Persons suffering from diabetes
should use this food only on the advice of a physician.” On the other hand,
the suggestion on the label of “Pure Gluten Meal,” “Write for a copy of
Diabetic Foods and How to Use Them” is a more or less direct invitation to
self-treatment. Moreover, a letter dated May 9, 1916, apparently dictated for
the Kellogg Food Company by one Ruth French, in reply to an inquiry from
a layman, gives direct advice with no reference whatever to a physician.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>

<h5>CLAIMS MADE IN A LETTER TO A LAYMAN</h5>

<p>In addition to this inconsistent attitude the letter makes certain clear
misstatements, as follows:</p>

<p>“40 per cent. Gluten Flour actually contains 40 per cent. of pure Gluten,
making it a perfectly safe article of diet in all but the gravest cases of diabetes.
From our Gluten Flour excellent bread, gems and puffs are made that perfectly
satisfy the craving for bread with no harmful results.” This flour contains
33.63 per cent. of gluten, not 40 per cent.; it is not “a perfectly safe article of
diet in all but the gravest cases of diabetes,” for if one reads the literature
correctly, starch restriction is more necessary in mild than in severe cases
of diabetes. Furthermore, the bread, gems and puffs made from such a flour
do not “satisfy the craving for bread with no harmful results.”</p>

<p>In the next paragraph of the letter, undue emphasis is laid on the “objectionable
properties” of flesh foods, a statement only in accord with the tenets
of extreme vegetarians. I also doubt very much whether the statement is true
that “under a diet of our diabetic foods the thirst to which diabetics are so
often subject is usually very much relieved.”</p>

<p>In the next paragraph the assertion is made that “The diet indicated <span class="ell">..</span>.
is in keeping with the ideas of the highest medical authorities<span class="ell">...</span>. Meat
is entirely excluded from the dietary.” My reading of the literature does not
show that the leading authorities take any such position. Later on reference
is made to von Noorden’s claim as to the superiority of vegetable over animal
proteins, which I have already discussed under “Pure Gluten Biscuit.” (Certain
detached sentences of von Noorden might justify such a statement, but a
reading of all he says on the subject leads to a very different conclusion.)</p>


<h5>CLAIMS MADE IN AN ADVERTISING BOOKLET</h5>

<p>The whole booklet is written from the standpoint of an extreme vegetarian,
and therefore is often misleading in its conclusions.</p>

<p>Page 5. “The researches of Ogata and others have shown that cane sugar
is a less wholesome food than the natural sugars found in fruits and produced
in the body by the digestion of starch, that is, fruit sugars and malt sugars.”
In opposition to this I quote from von Noorden, their own authority, “Die
Zuckerkrankheit und ihre Behandlung,” Berlin, 1910, page 270:</p>

<p>“That levulose, milk sugar and inulin are more useful than the other carbohydrates
is a common opinion, but the importance of their use in practice does
not correspond with the theory. In light cases the form of carbohydrates
makes little difference; in severe cases the advantage from using levulose,
milk sugar, etc., is only slightly greater than from using bread and flour<span class="ell">...</span>.
Only in certain cases does it appear to me that the special form of
carbohydrates possesses any particular significance.”</p>

<p>On page 92 of the same work von Noorden tells us that of the carbohydrates
dextrose is the worst, with maltose almost as bad (in spite of the fact that
Kellogg exploits his “Meltose,” the “new carbohydrate,” as of special value for
diabetics). He also says that levulose increases glycosuria only about half
as much as dextrose, when used occasionally, but with long use it is as bad
as dextrose and starch.</p>

<p>Page 5. The company refers to sugar as “possibly also causing diabetes.”
Sugar or any other carbohydrate may under diabetic conditions cause an
increase of glucose in the urine, but I do not believe that any food or any diet
can cause diabetes.</p>

<p>Page 7. “That the large use of meat and eggs is not only detrimental but
positively dangerous in many cases of diabetes is now a well known and recognized
fact.” The dietaries of well known authorities on diabetes are not in
harmony with this statement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>
<p>Page 13. “It has been discovered that the complete suppression of carbohydrates
from the dietary is not only unnecessary but is highly detrimental and
even dangerous.” “The complete suppression of carbohydrates from the dietary”
is the only means the physician has to determine the diabetic’s carbohydrate
tolerance. If carbohydrate-poor foods are so “highly detrimental and even
dangerous,” why does the company exploit foods like “Pure Gluten Flour”
and “Pure Gluten Biscuit,” whose chief claim to excellence is their comparative
freedom from carbohydrates?</p>

<p>Page 17. “Cream is an emulsion, and, with the exception of egg yolk, is
the only form in which animal fat is found in an emulsified state.” Milk,
Nature’s most wonderful emulsion, is apparently overlooked.</p>

<p>Page 19. “<span class="ell">..</span>. these foods <span class="ell">..</span>. will be found of great value <span class="ell">..</span>.
especially as substitutes for the breads and meats which are the most objectionable
features of the ordinary diet, and which should, as far as possible,
be interdicted in this class of cases.” This is simply special pleading for the
Kellogg vegetarian diet.</p>

<p>Page 19. “Our glutens <span class="ell">..</span>. are all thoroughly standardized, so that
in their use the physician and the patient know just the amount of starch eaten.”
This standard­ization is largely mythical. For instance, “Pure Gluten Biscuit”
claims 0 to 5 per cent. “carbohydrates (starch),” whereas I find 14.84 per
cent. carbohydrates with 4.02 per cent. starch. “40 per cent. Gluten Flour”
claims 40 per cent. gluten and 40 to 45 per cent. carbohydrates, whereas I
find 33.63 and 55.35 per cent., respectively. “Pure Gluten Meal” claims 0 to
5 per cent. “carbohydrates (starch)” whereas I find 16.77 per cent. carbohydrates
and 6.77 per cent. starch. I have a record of six analyses each
of “40 per cent. Gluten Flour” and “40 per cent. Gluten Biscuit,” which
show the hollowness of this claim of “standard­ization.” The flour showed 33.6,
35.0, 42.9, 36.8, 35.6, and 40.9 per cent. of protein, with from 40.8 to 55.4
per cent. of carbohydrates; the biscuits 32.7, 33.2, 39.5, 43.3, 33.9, and 41.2 per
cent. of protein, with from 41.1 to 54.0 per cent. of carbohydrates. In fact,
my experience shows that the Kellogg products are more poorly “standardized”
than most of the diabetic foods on the market.</p>

<p>Page 20. “May be made to carry a large amount of fat in the form of
butter, a most desirable thing in the treatment of diabetes,” while on page 16
the company claims that in an experiment of Minkowski on a dog, butter
“passed through the body without change, none being absorbed”; these are
certainly contradictory statements. The explanation is that on the one page
the company is exploiting its biscuits, and on the other its nut preparations.</p>

<p>Page 20. Again the incorrect claim is made for “40 per cent. Gluten Flour”
that “we believe this to be the only standardized gluten flour made.”</p>

<p>Page 21. The claim is made that flesh foods are “objectionable on account
of the large amounts of ptomains and toxins which they contain.” I was not
aware that fresh meats contained any ptomains whatever. On the same page
the claim is again made that by the use of the Kellogg nut foods “diabetics lose
their thirst,” a claim which I think is more than doubtful.</p>

<p>Page 22. “Nuts are a whole food, containing all the elements required for
the perfect nutrition of the body.” A marked characteristic of nuts is that
they are not “a whole food,” as with the exception of a few varieties, such as
the chestnut, they are extremely poor in carbohydrates, which fact gives them
their value in the diabetic diet.</p>

<p>Page 23. “With the exception of the potato, the beet and the carrot, vegetables
contain little sugar or starch.” Corn, beans and peas are all vegetables
which are relatively high in carbohydrates, and for this reason are specifically
excluded from the diabetic’s dietary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>
<p>From the foregoing considerations I would recommend that the company’s
analyses of “40 per cent. Gluten Biscuit,” “40 per cent. Gluten Meal,” and “20
per cent. Gluten Meal” be accepted as correct. Before the Council can accept
any of these products, the following steps should be taken:</p>

<p>The company on all its labels should correct the impression that “carbohydrates”
and “starch” are synonymous terms.</p>

<p>The labels of all the preparations examined should be changed in accordance
with the criticisms given above.</p>

<p>In all cases in which analytic data are given, it would be preferable to
state only the minimum of protein and the maximum of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>The booklet, “Practical Suggestions About Diet in Diabetes,” should be
radically changed along the lines noted above.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on

<h3>IODO-MANGAN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Iodo-Mangan, made by the Chemische Fabrik Helfenberg A.&nbsp;G., near
Dresden, Germany, and sold in the United States by the Reinschild Chemical
Company, New York, is a solution said to contain iron, manganese and iodin
in combination with peptone. It is claimed to be a reconstructive tonic and
blood-making adjuvant, with favorable action in affections of the glandular
system. It was admitted to New and Non­official Remedies in 1907, before the
Council had adopted the present Rule 10, which provides that no article shall
be admitted to New and Non­official Remedies which, because of its unscientific
composition, is useless or inimical to the best interests of the public or of the
medical profession. In 1911 the Council considered the question whether or not
this product was still eligible and decided in the end to retain it as probably
having some merit. To determine if Iodo-Mangan was eligible for New and
Non­official Remedies, 1917, the Reinschild Chemical Company was requested
to send in the current advertising matter. As this advertising was not sent in
and as apparently the product was not marketed at the present time, the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry voted to omit Iodo-Mangan from New
and Non­official Remedies. At the same time the Reinschild Chemical Company
was informed that the preparation might be submitted for reconsideration
at any time.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916,

<p>The advertising matter suggests the promiscuous, thoughtless and irrational
use of Liquid Albolene and of a number of Albolene preparations by extravagant
claims, such, for example, as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Albolene will never fail to bring a free, easy stool, no matter what condition may
be present, from obstinate atony of the bowel to fissure, fistula, or even malignant disease,
and in spite of the failure of ordinary purgatives to which the patient may have become
habituated<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“Aromatic Liquid Albolene is actually the first laxative presented to the medical profession
that seems to have no drawback<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“It will not have been lost upon the physician who has read the remarks on the use
of Aromatic Liquid Albolene to regulate the bowels in surgical cases, that there are many
instances where it would prove equally valuable during the treatment of acute diseases.
In the exanthemata, in pneumonia, for example, to cite only a few of the conditions where
it may be used to advantage, an absolutely reliable laxative that will not in any way weaken
or distress the patient, presents obvious superiority to any of the agents heretofore in
common use.”</p></div>

<p>The Council held Liquid Albolene ineligible because the product is marketed
in a way to encourage its indiscriminate and irrational use by the public
(Rule 4) and because unwarranted therapeutic claims are made for it (Rule
6).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;65.</i>)</p>

<h3>NAPHEY’S MEDICATED UTERINE WAFERS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Naphey’s Medicated Uterine Wafers were submitted to the Council by the
manufacturers, Naphey &amp; Co., some years ago and were rejected. Naphey &amp;
Co. has recently requested reconsideration of the preparation, and has submitted
advertising matter, trade packages and sample packages. The label of
the trade package contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Naphey’s Wafers. For the local treatment of diseases of women, indicated in catarrhal
conditions of the vagina, and of the uterine cervix. As a [<i>sic!</i>] adjuvant for the physician
to use in carrying out treatment of disease of the uterus.”</p>

<p>“Zinc Sulphate, 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;gr., Sodium Sulphate, 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;gr., Sodium Borate, 4&nbsp;gr., Boric
Acid, <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.”</p>

<p>“Naphey &amp; Co., Warren, Pa., U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.”</p>

<p>“Each box contains 25 wafers, sufficient for three months’ treatment. Price per box, 25c.”</p></div>

<p>In name, composition, and general appearance of the package, Naphey’s
Medicated Uterine Wafers bear a strong resemblance to Micajah’s Medicated
Uterine Wafers (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 26, 1910, p.&nbsp;1070). An advertising
pamphlet reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In every form of leucorrhea Naphey’s Medicated Uterine Wafers are indicated&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“What is true of leucorrhea is also true of all other functional troubles affecting the
female genital canal; they are all treated best by astringents and antiseptics. And these,
to be effective, must be applied in prolonged contact.”</p></div>

<p>The implication that all “functional troubles affecting the female genital
canal” are best treated by astringent tablets like Naphey’s Medicated Uterine
Wafers is an absurdity. The naming of disease conditions on the label, the
manifestly unwarranted and exaggerated therapeutic claims, the name, which
is non-descriptive of composition but suggestive of use, and the fixed formula,
which cannot rationally be expected to give uniformly satisfactory results in
the wide range of conditions for which the product is recommended, render
Naphey’s Medicated Uterine Wafers ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies
under Rules 4, 6, 8 and 10.</p>

<p>The report having been sent to Naphey &amp; Co., the manufacturer offered, on
condition that the preparation be accepted, to revise the advertising matter in
<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>minor particulars, to remove disease names from the trade package and to
adopt the name Naphey’s Wafers or Naphey’s Tablets. The Council advised
Naphey &amp; Co. that the proposed names do not conform to the requirements
for acceptance in New and Non­official Remedies because they do not indicate
the composition of this pharmaceutical mixture, and moreover, that the routine
use of a complex formula such as that of these tablets is irrational.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;66.</i>)</p>

<h3>NUJOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Nujol, a liquid petrolatum (Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Bayonne,
N.&nbsp;J.), was submitted to the Council by the manufacturers. The Council
advised the company that, before Nujol could be made eligible for New and
Non­official Remedies, the advertising claims made for it must be revised to
conform to the rules of the Council and the term “liquid petrolatum” must be
used in connection with the brand designation and given equal prominence on
the labels, advertisements and all circulars. The company thereupon submitted
a label on which the name “Nujol” appeared in large red letters and under it
in small letters the words “Liquid Petrolatum.” This did not meet the Council’s
requirement with regard to the name. Moreover, Nujol continued to be advertised
to the public under exaggerated and unwarranted claims.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was sent to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey,
which thereupon submitted revised advertising copy. This copy was decidedly
less objectionable than the previous advertising but still contained exaggerated
statements. The copy for use in lay journals particularly evidenced exaggeration.
Observation on many occasions of a similar fact has convinced the
Council of the inexpediency of admitting to New and Non­official Remedies any
article which is advertised to the public<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_101_104" id="FNanchor_101_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_104" class="fnanchor">101</a></span></p>

<p>The Council held that conflict with Rules 3, 6 and 8 prevented the acceptance
of Nujol and authorized the publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;68.</i>)</p>

<h3>PULVOIDS NATRIUM COMPOUND</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Pulvoids Natrium Compound was submitted to the Council by the Drug
Products Company, Inc., New York, with the statement that each pulvoid
(coated tablet, said to be made to dissolve in the intestinal tract) represents
the equivalent of:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Potassium Nitrate</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Sodium Nitrite</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">&#8199;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;gr.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Sodium Bicarbonate</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">2&#8199;&#8199;</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Fl. Ext. Crataegus Oxycantha</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05 nowrap">1&#8199;&#8199;</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;min.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Nitroglycerin</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">&#8199;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>250</sub></span></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;gr.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span></p>

<p>According to the advertisements the tablets are “indicated in the treatment
of high blood pressure and all forms of hypertension of the cardio-vascular
system.” It is claimed that the tablets “will not irritate the kidneys.”</p>

<p>The Council, having submitted its objections to the manufacturer and considered
the firm’s reply, held that Pulvoids Natrium Compound was inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. The claim is made that the tablets disintegrate in the intestines; experiments
conducted by the Council indicated that in most cases they would be
broken up in the stomach. It was found that the tablets were visibly changed
immediately after being put into gastric juice or even into distilled water;
they disintegrated within from three to four hours, not only in gastric juice
(obtained from a dog) at 37&nbsp;C., but also in distilled water. It is quite usual
for solids to remain in the stomach for more than three hours. If they make
their way out of the stomach in less than that time the gastric movements must
be so vigorous as further to hasten the disintegration of the tablets.</p>

<p>2. The rules of the Council require that the name of a pharmaceutical mixture
shall indicate the potent ingredients. The name of this mixture does not
indicate the presence of the nitrites, the potassium nitrate, the bicarbonate or
the extract of hawthorne and the nondescriptive name is likely to lead physicians
to use the tablets without fully realizing what they are giving.</p>

<p>3. No evidence was submitted that the tablets, as found on the market,
contained the amount of sodium nitrite and nitroglycerin claimed. That is, it
does not appear that the manufacturer checks the sodium nitrite and nitroglycerin
content by analysis. The Council did not determine the nitrite content
of the tablets. It maintains that when a manufacturer places a product on the
market the burden of proof is on that manufacturer to show that the facts are
in accordance with his claims for his product. Further, the examination by
the Council of one or several specimens of any commercial product (particularly
in the case of nitroglycerin preparations) would not be a guarantee of
the constancy of its composition so long as the manufacturer does not himself
control the composition by analysis. The necessity of such control of tablets
containing nitroglycerin is evident from the <span class="nowrap">report<a name="FNanchor_102_105" id="FNanchor_102_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_105" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> of L.&nbsp;F. Kebler of the U.&nbsp;S.
Bureau of Chemistry. Dr. Kebler said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. nitroglycerin tablets have in a majority of cases been found deficient
in the nitroglycerin content declared.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. these commodities are manufactured largely by rule of thumb.
Little checking obtains in their manufacture and generally no analyst is
employed.”</p></div>

<p>A further proof that nitroglycerin tablets are likely to be deficient in strength
is contained in the convictions under the Food and Drugs Act of manufacturers
who sold tablets below the declared strength, recorded from time to time
(Notices of Judgments Nos. 3405, 2059, 1843, 1799).</p>

<p>4. There is no good evidence, experimental or clinical, to justify the simultaneous
administration in fixed proportion of two vasodilators like sodium
nitrite and glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin). Also there is no rational excuse
for combining extract of hawthorne, which is said to have a tonic effect on the
heart muscle, with nitrites, which cause relaxation of the vascular system, or
for the combination with these constituents of potassium nitrate or of sodium
bicarbonate.</p>

<p>In the absence of evidence for the combination, Pulvoids Natrium Compound
must be considered an irrational mixture, the use of which is a detriment to
sound drug therapy and, hence, not admissible to New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;69.</i>)</p>

<h3>SALOFORM</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>A referee submitted the following report of the American Medical Association
Chemical Laboratory to the Council:</p>


<h5>ANALYSIS OF SALOFORM</h5>

<p>Saloform (Flexner) is advertised by the Robinson-Pettet Company of
Louisville, Ky. In the advertisements for the product it is stated that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Saloform is a definite chemical compound the component parts of which are
<i>Hexamethylene Tetramine</i>, <i>Salicylic Acid</i> and Lithia.”</p>

<p>“As a Uric Acid Solvent it is indicated in <i>Rheumatism</i>, <i>Gout</i>, in <i>Phosphaturia</i>, in <i>Gravel</i>,
and in <i>Renal Colic</i>.”</p>

<p>“As a Genito-Urinary Antiseptic it limits suppuration anywhere along the Urinary Tract,
from the Kidneys down to the orifice of Urethra.”</p></div>

<p>As, even after diligent search, no description of a compound of hexa­methylen­amine
(hexa­methylene­tetramine), salicylic acid and lithia was found in
chemical literature, it seemed probable that Saloform is merely a mixture of
hexa­methylen­amine and lithium salicylate. Accordingly the separation of
Saloform into its component parts by means of selected solvents was attempted.
By triturating the powder with chloroform, filtering and evaporating the filtrate,
a residue was obtained which gave satisfactory tests for hexa­methylen­amine
but contained only traces of salicylic acid or lithium salicylate. The portion
insoluble in chloroform was dissolved in water. The solution gave satisfactory
tests for lithium salicylate but not for hexa­methylen­amine. From these tests
it is evident that Saloform is a simple mixture of hexa­methylen­amine and
lithium salicylate. Quantitative examination indicated that the two ingredients,
hexa­methylen­amine and lithium salicylate, are present in approximately equal
amounts.</p>


<h5>REFEREE’S RECOMMENDATION</h5>

<p>The report of our Chemical Laboratory shows that Saloform is not a
definite compound as claimed, but a simple mixture of hexa­methylen­amin and
lithium salicylate. It is therefore in conflict with Rule 1. It is also in conflict
with Rule 6, for neither hexa­methylen­amin, lithium, nor salicylate are thera­peutically
effective “uric acid solvents”; nor would any of these have any
effect on “phosphaturia.”</p>

<p>The mixture also conflicts with Rule 10; for it is inadvisable to administer
the ingredients in fixed, but unknown proportions.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Saloform be deemed inadmissible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>The Council adopted the recommendation of the referee and authorized
publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;71.</i>)</p>

<h3>SECRETOGEN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>About a year ago the Council declared Secretogen<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_103_106" id="FNanchor_103_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_106" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> a product the active
ingredient of which was stated to be “pancreatic secretin” and advertised as
a remedy for certain conditions of defective digestion and assimilation, to be
ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies. The reasons for this decision
were stated at the time as follows:</p>

<p>“1. No evidence has been presented that the absence of secretin is a cause
of gastro-intestinal diseases. It is usually present, and if not present, as in
<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>achylia gastrica, there is evidently some compensating arrangement by which
the pancreas is stimulated to perform its regular functions.</p>

<p>“2. There is no evidence that secretin in any form is physiologically active
when administered by mouth.”</p>

<p>Since Secretogen was not the only so-called secretin preparation on the
market, and since the use of secretin preparations was recommended by certain
writers, notwithstanding the lack of evidence of its value, the Council caused
an experimental investigation of the question to be made. This was carried out
by Prof. A.&nbsp;J. Carlson of the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>No secretin was found in the commercial products examined, namely,
Secretogen Tablets, Secretogen Elixir and Duodenin. Furthermore, Carlson’s
<span class="nowrap">results<a name="FNanchor_104_107" id="FNanchor_104_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_107" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> confirmed the Council’s previous conclusion as to the inertness of
secretin administered by mouth. The Council endorsed Professor Carlson’s
findings<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_105_108" id="FNanchor_105_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_108" class="fnanchor">105</a></span></p>

<p>The G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company has replied to the publication of this report
in the letter printed below. (A portion of this letter, which consists of a communication
from an unnamed correspondent of the G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company
and the company’s comment thereon, has been omitted.) The Council offered
to publish this if the Carnrick Company would furnish the name of the writer.
This it has not done. As will be seen, the company now shifts ground, abandoning
entirely the claim that Secretogen contains secretin. The Council has
authorized publication of the letter (omitting the part just mentioned), together
with the comment that follows.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“<i>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association.</i></p>

<p>“Gentlemen:&mdash;The opinion of the Council and the contribution by Professor
Carlson which appeared in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association
for Jan. 15, 1916, have been read by us with interest. The column of Current
Comment dealing with ‘Tiger-Bone Therapy and Clinical Experience’ has
appealed to our good nature and, under the circumstances, our sense of humor.</p>

<p>“Professor Carlson seems to have quite well established that the so-called
secretin preparations do not contain secretin to any appreciable extent, and
that they are inert in laboratory experiments on normal animals. At the same
time, to do away with an apparent discrimination on the part of the management
of the Council, it would have been well if Professor Carlson had included
the so-called secretin preparations belonging to another well-known firm which
markets such a product. This discrimination has already been referred to by us.</p>

<p>“Had Professor Carlson stopped at the determination of the therapeutic
availability of secretin given by mouth, his work might have been accepted
without comment, even if we should have thought it advisable to object to
the matter published by the Council. But the professor went beyond his
province entirely when, in commenting on the findings obtained by using
Secretogen clinically, he said: ‘It is, perhaps, impertinent for laboratory
men to comment on these clinical results.’ It is. His point was well taken
and it is a profound pity that Professor Carlson did not observe his own ruling.</p>

<p>“In the words of a correspondent of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical
Association, in discussing Professor Carlson’s criticism of Dr. Crile’s ‘Kinetic
Drive,’ ‘it behooves the laboratory man to be circumspect in his criticism
of clinical theories, since going beyond the bounds of well-established things
weakens his position, not merely with reference to the particular subject under
discussion, but with reference to clinical phenomena in general.’ Clinical
<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>results have definitely established the value of Secretogen. As the matter now
stands this statement is beyond criticism.</p>

<p>“When Secretogen was first introduced we assumed that it depended on
secretin for results produced. In this assumption we were in good company,
as witnessed by the testimony of Moore, Edie and Abram when, in the course
of their investigations as to the value in diabetes of <i>a secretin-bearing extract
given by mouth</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_106_109" id="FNanchor_106_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> they said: ‘In the majority of these cases <span class="ell">..</span>. there has
been no appreciable fall in the output of sugar <span class="ell">..</span>. in some of these negative
cases there has been noted, however, improvement in the digestion and,
in certain cases, the patient’s weight has increased.’ They also state that the
secretin-bearing product ‘<i>appears to stimulate the functional activity</i> of the
duodenum<span class="nowrap">.’<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> They give a most significant report<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_107_110" id="FNanchor_107_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_110" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> We quote from the paper
as follows:</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘The patient had been under observation for six months before treatment
and the sugar was not reducible by diet. <i>Almost at once the dyspepsia from
which he was suffering was relieved and his general nutrition improved to such
an extent that he regained over eighteen pounds in weight, which he had previously
lost, and this improvement was accompanied by complete recovery</i> of
his physical and mental energies<span class="nowrap">.’<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p>“Inasmuch as this improvement could not have been due to the contained
secretin it must have been due to some other principle contained in the extract.
Our experience and that of the physicians who have used Secretogen establish
the fact that Moore, Edie and Abram made no mistake when they came to the
conclusion that what they termed a secretin-bearing extract stimulates the
functional activity of the duodenum and improves the digestion.</p>

<p>“When Professor Carlson was investigating Secretogen he must have realized
that he was dealing essentially with an extract of the duodenal mucosa. It
is, therefore, all the more surprising, considering his extensive researches
into the literature, that he should have ignored the testimony of some of his
own authorities, particularly Hallion, as to the value of extracts of the duodenal
mucosa in duodenal insufficiencies. The meticulous carefulness with which this
evidence was avoided is hardly worthy of the best traditions of physiology, a
science which has truth for its first and last aim.</p>

<p>“Hallion in his ‘La Pratique de l’Opothérapie’ says that the ‘aims of
duodenal opotherapy are: 1, To supply deficient duodenal juice. 2, Above all
to stimulate and to relieve this organ&mdash;<i>notably to aid the production of secretin</i><span class="nowrap"><a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>&mdash;and
so profit by the stimulating action which duodenal extract exercises on
the duodenal mucosa which action we, Enriquez and myself, believe and have
experimentally proved, conforms to the general principles of opotherapy. 3, By
means of the production of secretin, to reinforce the biliary, pancreatic and
intestinal secretions. 4, To stimulate intestinal peristalsis.</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Principal indications: Intestinal dyspepsias, intestinal autointoxications,
certain forms of constipation and duodenal insufficiency.’</p>

<p>“At the International Congress of Medicine, Madrid, 1903, Hallion said that
he felt justified in stating that <i>duodenal opotherapy correctly carried out must
be classed under the very best methods of treating dyspepsia</i><span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> The results had
been satisfactory and, in many cases, remarkable. It had been nil in a few
cases but it had never been harmful in any degree. He pointed out that Marfan
was the first to employ this substance clinically. Marfan had had particularly
excellent results in children of 15 months to 4 years suffering with marked malnutrition,
anorexia and constipation. <i>Marfan prescribed the duodenal extract
given in milk</i><span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> Hallion further remarks that, as he is not a practitioner, he
had had only one opportunity to test duodenal opotherapy clinically. The case
was that of a man of 26 years with obstinate intestinal dyspepsia and severe
<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>constipation which had persisted from childhood. This patient had been treated
by enemas, laxatives, diet, etc. <i>Treatment with duodenal extract resulted in
a complete cure</i><span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> Hallion points out <i>that the most satisfactory aspect of duodenal
opotherapy is the permanent effect produced</i><span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> which bears out his statement
that these extracts have the power to aid in the restoration of function
and structure of an organ.</p>

<p>“This has been so well established that the principle is now embodied in a
law which is frequently referred to as ‘Hallion’s Law’: ‘Extracts of an organ
exert on the same organ an exciting influence which lasts for a longer or
shorter time. When the organ is insufficient it is conceivable that this influence
augments its action and, when it is injured, that it favors its restoration.’</p>

<p>“In ‘La Pratique de l’Opothérapie’ Hallion points out that ‘the opotherapeutic
product which corresponds to the affected organ represents in some way the
stimulating and elective food for that organ, and if we supply the organ with
a food which is more complete than it necessarily needs, the affected organ
can exercise its elective action and take up only those substances of which it
is in need.’</p>

<p>“Hallion’s observations on this point are beautifully borne out by the classic
work of J.&nbsp;W. Draper, as reported in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical
Association, Sept. 26, 1914. This report gives results in both laboratory and
clinical experiments.</p>

<p>“In order to show that fed jejunal and ileac epithelium exercise some
special detoxicating power, not yet understood but definitely recognizable,
Draper fed a control series of dogs with intestinal obstruction, experimentally
produced, on emulsified cells of liver, spleen, pancreas and muscle tissue.
These animals lived a few hours longer than not-fed controls, but Draper says
that it is evident that these cells had either no detoxicating action, or a very
feeble one compared with intestinal epithelium. He used jejunal and ileac
epithelium clinically in two instances: 1st, In a female dog which had had
‘chronic stomach trouble’ for six months. When Draper saw her she had had
complete intestinal obstruction for five days, with symptoms of tachycardia,
extreme nervousness and great weakness in the hind legs. Draper removed a
pebble from her intestine but her condition was still grave.</p>

<p>“She was immediately put on small-intestine epithelium derived from two
dogs of different breed. Draper says that from a long experience with duodenally
obstructed dogs, he should not have expected her to recover, but the
symptoms gradually subsided and she lived. The second instance in which he
used the epithelium thera­peutically was in the case of a man who suffered from
an annular cancer of the intestine with definite symptoms of obstruction. After
the operation, and realizing that the patient was in a desperate condition, he
fed him an emulsion of intestinal epithelium from a dog. The pulse improved
and the patient lived.</p>

<p>“Some of Draper’s conclusions are as follows:</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Autotoxemia in intestinal obstruction undoubtedly arises from an interference
with cellular reactions of the intestinal epithelium<span class="ell">...</span>. When
small-intestine epithelial cells of healthy animals are <i>placed in the</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>stomach</i><a href="#Footnote_106_109" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>
of duodenally obstructed animals, such animals have lived nearly twice as
long as not-fed controlled animals. This evidence is strongly opposed to the
bacterial theory of origin of toxins.’</p>

<p>“The point to be emphasized is this: If this emulsion of intestinal epithelium
had been fed to a normal dog and a normal man, what would have happened?
Absolutely nothing. On the other hand, given as it was to a dog and a man
in desperate need it exercised a potent effect.</p>

<p>“Abundant clinical testimony can be cited in support of the opinions of
Moore, Edie and Abram, Hallion, Marfan and Draper as to the value of
extracts of the intestinal mucosa given by mouth in pathological conditions.
<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>We have previously cited the published favorable opinions of such gastro­enter­olo­gists
as Anthony Bassler, Lewis Brinton, G.&nbsp;R. Lockwood, and R.&nbsp;C.
Kemp, so there is no need to recapitulate their experiences with what they
honestly believed to be secretin-bearing extracts, but which were essentially
extracts of the duodenal mucosa.</p>

<p>“Supplementing the evidence of these men as to the value of these extracts
we submit an excerpt from a letter from one of the best known physicians
of Edinburgh:</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘I can speak in very high praise of Secretogen, which I have used in both
tablet form and as the elixir. There is no doubt about its value in a certain
class of intractable indigestion which refuses to be benefited by any other
remedy. On several occasions I have been much gratified by the definite relief
obtained in this class of cases. It hits the mark also in some types of obstinate
constipation&mdash;I think those cases where the trouble is wrapped up in impaired
enervation of the intestine, and where stasis occurs at certain segments of the
canal.’</p>

<p>“Hallion very pertinently points <span class="nowrap">out<a name="FNanchor_108_111" id="FNanchor_108_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_111" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> that it is now accepted that opotherapy
is not substitutive, but homostimulative and he remarks further that it is well
to bear in mind that the so-called active substances which make the extract
efficacious need not necessarily be the hormones. ‘It may be the elements of
tissue structure which may come to the aid of the injured organ. The hormone
should not therefore be looked on as the only active agent of opotherapy and,
while its action is important, it need not necessarily be preponderant. The
chemical isolation of the hormones is, of course, of interest but may not be
as vital to organotherapy as we have thought.’&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>


<h5>COMMENT BY THE COUNCIL ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY</h5>

<p>The G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company, which formerly claimed that Secretogen was
efficacious because it contained secretin, now admits this claim to be unfounded.
Notwithstanding, the manufacturers still call their product Secretogen and
make for it practically the same therapeutic claims as before. They now base
these claims on vague “principles of opotherapy” and on so-called “clinical
testimony.” The burden of proof rests on them to show that these old claims,
already discredited but put forth again on new grounds, are justified. Have
they done so?</p>

<p>The “clinical testimony” is not convincing. So much of it as is definite
enough to permit of criticism has already been dealt with. The remainder
consists of mere assertions; it is not through reliance on such evidence that the
Council can discharge its trust. On this side of the question there is nothing
new to be said&mdash;reassertion of a refuted argument does not constitute fresh
proof.</p>

<p>Nor is the case better on the experimental side. The statements of Hallion,
Enriquez, Zuelzer and <span class="nowrap">others<a name="FNanchor_109_112" id="FNanchor_109_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_112" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> as to the existence of a “peristaltic hormone”
not only have failed of confirmation, but also have been positively discredited.
With regard to Draper’s work, which dealt with acute intestinal obstruction,
it is difficult to see what is its relevance to the present issue, particularly since
Draper’s results were obtained with a product derived from the mucosa of the
jejunum and ileum and <i>not with an extract of the duodenum</i> such as Secretogen
purports to be.</p>

<p>The innuendo that the Council discriminates in favor of certain manufacturers,
is itself a confession of weakness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>
<p>In publishing this correspondence the Council’s sole object is to put the
medical profession in possession of the exact facts of the case. These may
fairly be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>1. Secretogen was originally marketed as a preparation containing secretin.
None was found in it.</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding proof of this fact, the G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company retain
the original name of the product, knowing that, by its association with their
former erroneous assertions concerning Secretogen, this name must inevitably
convey to a physician using the product the impression that he is administering
secretin. In the advertising literature no hint is given that this original statement
was erroneous.</p>

<p>3. The product called “Secretogen” has not been shown, either experimentally
and by sound clinical evidence, to possess useful therapeutic properties.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the Council reaffirms its decision.&mdash;(<i>From Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1916, p.&nbsp;72.</i>)</p>

<h3>IRON CITRATE GREEN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>H. K. Mulford Company and E.&nbsp;R. Squibb and Sons submitted to the
Council ampules containing solutions of iron citrate green. It thus became
necessary to consider the eligibility of iron citrate green itself for admission to
New and Non­official Remedies. As the rules of the Council provide that
nonessential modifications of official or nonproprietary preparations will not
be recognized, the above named firms were asked to state what advantages, if
any, the so-called iron citrate green had over the official iron and ammonium
citrate. In reply the H.&nbsp;K. Mulford Company wrote that it had come to the
conclusion that iron citrate green and ampules thereof would undoubtedly be
considered by the Council as a nonessential modification of an official product,
adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It seems to differ from the official ferric citrate so far as essentials go only in color,
but custom, which is exceedingly hard to change in South America, demands that this green
variety of ampules be used in place of the official product.”</p></div>

<p>In reply to a similar letter of inquiry E.&nbsp;R. Squibb and Sons wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Iron citrate green (iron and ammonium citrate green) differs from the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. iron
and ammonium citrate in that it contains less iron and more citric acid and more ammonium
citrate than does the latter. It is of course a modification of the official salt and is
supplied to meet a real demand. Its reaction is quite decidedly acid and our present stock
contains Fe slightly below the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. requirements for iron, assaying 15.74 per cent.
instead of 16 per cent. Fe. The tests used to control its quality are those for the official
product except as before indicated, it is always acid instead of neutral, as the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.
requires for that salt.”</p></div>

<p>The smaller iron content (98 per cent. of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. requirement) of the
green variety referred to by E.&nbsp;R. Squibb and Sons is so small as to be negligible.
Further, the low iron content as well as the acidity of the green salt
would appear to be detriments rather than advantages. Inasmuch as no evidence
has been presented to show that iron citrate green is superior in any way to
the well-known iron and ammonium citrate the Council held that iron citrate
green, and with it the dosage forms, was ineligible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>The preceding report was submitted to the Mulford Company and to E.&nbsp;R.
Squibb and Sons for comment before publication. The former firm replied that
in the present case it felt bound to supply the existing demand, the latter replied
that, to give the Council its support in this matter, the sale of iron citrate
green and ampules thereof would be discontinued.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>ASPIRIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The referee’s report on Aspirin-Bayer which follows was submitted to the
Council and adopted by it and, in accordance with the referee’s recommendation,
was sent to the Bayer Company, Inc. The company’s reply contained
nothing to warrant the continued recognition of this product by the Council.
It was accordingly directed that Aspirin-Bayer be omitted from New and
Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h5>REFEREE’S REPORT</h5>

<p>The referee’s attention has been called to the systematic campaign of advertising
aspirin to the public. He is informed that tablets have been marketed
for some time in “vest-pocket” boxes, bearing the name “Aspirin” permanently
affixed, which is in technical conflict with the Council’s rule against indirect
advertising to the public. More recently, conspicuous advertisements have
appeared in daily papers. These are technically in conflict with the rule
against direct advertising to the public.</p>

<p>In addition to the plain technical conflicts with the Council’s rules there
is a feature of the case which has not hitherto been raised and which should
be fully considered: It may be remarked that the advertisements contain no
therapeutic recommendation, and do not, on their face, urge the public to
employ aspirin but apparently merely tell the public how it may protect itself
against sophistication. In substance, they say: “If you are a user of aspirin,
this is how you may obtain the genuine.” It might be said that this is not an
attempt to increase the use or sale of aspirin&mdash;the ordinary object of advertising&mdash;but
that the means of protection against adulteration is a “subject on
which the public should be instructed.” The principle of such exceptions is
stated in the comments to Rule 3 (New and Non­official Remedies, 1916, p.&nbsp;15);
and although the present case does not come under the exceptions specified
under these comments, it may be urged that the exceptions need to be increased
as occasion arises. The notorious adulteration of aspirin may well be urged
as establishing a need for a similar exception in its use.</p>

<p>The general principle of protecting the public against fraud, adulteration
and substitution is directly in line with the objects of the Council, and deserves
commendation and support. It is obvious, however, that the means adopted for
this end must be efficient, that they must not open the door to other, perhaps
greater evils and that they must be used in good faith. The policy of advertising
“Aspirin-Bayer” must be examined in these respects.</p>

<p>In the first place, the acceptance of a product by the Council implies an
agreement by the manufacturers or agents that they will adhere strictly to the
Council’s rules and will not depart from the letter or spirit of these rules
without notice to the Council. This principle has been grossly infringed in the
present case. There can be no doubt that the agents were aware that their
advertisements conflicted, at least with the letter of Rule 3. Nevertheless, they
did not, in any way, inform the Council of the change in policy. In this respect,
at least, they have not acted in good faith.</p>

<p>Secondly, the wording of the advertisement implies that only the tablets
stamped with “The Bayer Cross” are genuine. This is misleading, since every
druggist has the right to make unstamped tablets of aspirin, fully as genuine
as those stamped with the cross.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the cross itself cannot be considered an efficient protection; for
people who imitate aspirin will not hesitate to imitate the stamp. The remedy,
in either case, and as with any other drug, is the examination of trade samples,
and the vigorous prosecution of those guilty of violating the law.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span></p>
<p>Fourthly, the permanent affixing of the name “Aspirin” to the vest-pocket
boxes is also inefficient as a protection, and serves mainly as an advertisement.</p>

<p>Fifthly, whatever may have been the motives of the advertisers, and however
carefully the advertisements are worded, they will inevitably tend to
increase the use of aspirin by the public, and this is directly against the interests
of public health. The public does not know, as physicians do, that headaches
are merely symptoms of other, sometimes very serious conditions; and
that they are often the signal for the need of a thorough physical examination
and diagnosis. It is true that they are often also the symptoms of very minor
derangements, which will right themselves spontaneously; and that, in such
cases, drugs like aspirin may give relief and may do no harm. The patient,
however, is not educated to distinguish one class from the other, and therefore
anything that tends to promote the indiscriminate use of such remedies as
aspirin is detrimental to the public health. Furthermore, aspirin itself is not
always harmless. Alarming idiosyncrasies are sufficiently common that the
use of the first doses, at least, should require medical supervision. With these
considerations in mind, the referee is of the opinion that the direct and indirect
advertising of aspirin is to be condemned.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan.

<h3>PIL. CASCARA COMPOUND-ROBINS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>A circular issued by the A.&nbsp;H. Robins Company of Richmond, Va., contains
the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="lowercase smcap">PIL. CASCARA COMPOUND-ROBINS</span> is a rational therapeutic formula, composed of <span class="lowercase smcap">CASCARA</span>,
<span class="lowercase smcap">PODOPHYLLIN</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">COLOCYNTH</span> and <span class="lowercase smcap">HYOSCYAMUS</span>, which promotes a natural flow of secretions,
which is, in turn, the physiologic stimulant of peristalsis. Thus, a normal evacuation is
produced without subsequent inhibition.</p>

<p>“They contain no Mercury, Strychnia nor Belladonna.</p>

<p>“An ideal aid to any remedial agent, when a Mild, Medium or Strong alimentary stimulant
is needed [<i>sic</i>].</p>

<p>“Made in two strengths, the dosage may be easily regulated so as to obtain the effects
of an Anti-Dyspeptic, Aperient, Laxative or Cathartic, as desired. They never cause discomfort
unless given in larger dose than needed.”</p></div>

<p>This preparation is another example of the innumerable mixtures of well-known
drugs having nothing in the way of originality or of special therapeutic
value to recommend them.</p>

<p>The advertising implies that this particular combination has a special action
on the secretions of the gastro-intestinal tract; otherwise it would be hard to
explain the claim that the preparation is antidyspeptic, if that means anything
more than a laxative or cathartic.</p>

<p>The claim is made that this preparation contains no belladonna&mdash;yet it
admittedly contains hyoscyamus! This manifests either ignorance on the part
of the manufacturers, or an effort to impose on the medical profession. Both
belladonna and hyoscyamus contain variable amounts of similar alkaloids,
chiefly hyoscyamin. Hyoscyamus is feebler than belladonna in its action, as it
contains less alkaloid. The qualitative differences between the two drugs, with
reference to their use as laxatives, is so slight as to make the company’s claim
for hyoscyamus appear either deliberately misleading or to be the result of
crass ignorance. Promoting this mixture of well-known laxatives and cathartics
as an “ideal aid to any remedial agent when a mild, medium or strong
alimentary stimulant is needed” is a slur on the intelligence of physicians.</p>

<h3>CASTA-FLORA</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Casta-Flora is one of those complex preparations which are offered to the
medical profession, with plausible arguments in support of the claims made.
It is put out by the Wm. S. Merrell Chemical Co., Cincinnati. Each fluidounce
is said to represent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Castanea, fresh leaves, 40&nbsp;gr.; Passiflora, fresh plant, 40&nbsp;gr.; Gelsemium, green
tincture, 8 minims; Inula, represented by the camphoraceous stearoptene Helenin, 20&nbsp;grs.;
Iodized Lime, 8&nbsp;grs.; Menthol, 1-4&nbsp;grs.; Aromatic Syrup Yerba Santa, 60 minims.”</p></div>

<p>It is said to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A new combination of well-tried remedies of especial value in pertussis and other
spasmodic coughs. It is composed of astringent, antispasmodic, sedative and expectorant
agents, that control the paroxysms, relieve the irritation, promote expectoration, and give
tone to mucous membranes involved.”</p></div>

<p>Still more exaggerated claims are made for the individual constituents
of Casta-Flora, partly by direct statement, partly by inference. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Castanea is almost a specific in whooping cough and other spasmodic coughs.</p>

<p>“Passiflora is a narcotic, sedative and antispasmodic without habit-forming properties,
nor does it lock up the secretions and upset digestion like opiates.</p>

<p>“Inula (elecampane) has been employed as a cough remedy in England for centuries.
Its action is similar to guaiacol and creosote. Its active principle, helenin, is destructive
of tubercle bacilli in dilutions of 1 to 10,000.</p>

<p>“Iodized Lime, Menthol, and Yerba Santa are too well known as expectorants and
antiseptics to require more than passing mention.”</p></div>

<p>That Casta-Flora is a “new” combination may be admitted; it is improbable
that exactly this combination of obsolete drugs was ever before selected for
any purpose whatever, but the statement is misleading in that no new principle
of therapeutics is involved. On the contrary, the combination is just what
might be expected from haphazard choosing of discarded and nearly forgotten
drugs. It seems incredible that a reputable firm of manufacturing pharmacists
would make the positive statement that castanea is <i>almost</i> a specific in whooping
cough. Why not say it is a specific? It would be about as true. A specific
or “almost specific” for this disease would rank among great medical
discoveries; but castanea is merely a slightly astringent drug neither better
nor worse than scores of other astringent drugs that have been tried, found
valueless and discarded.</p>

<p>Hardly less surprising are the statements regarding passiflora. This herb
has been on the market about three quarters of a century. Not only has it
never established itself in scientific medicine, but it is not even mentioned in
modern standard works on therapeutics.</p>

<p>Of all the statements made in the circular perhaps the most remarkable, in
that it is so dangerously misleading, is that regarding helenin, the active
principle of elecampane. The statement that this principle (helenin) is
destructive of tubercle bacilli in dilutions of 1-10,000 can only mean that it is
of extraordinary value in the treatment of tuberculosis; in fact, it is definitely
stated that the action of elecampane is similar to that of guaiacol and creosote.</p>

<p>It is obvious that any drug which would destroy the tubercle bacilli in the
human lungs without exerting a toxic action on the patient would be a great
contribution to medicine. But although elecampane may have been used for
centuries it has proved to have little, if any, merit, and even the National
Standard Dispensatory, p.&nbsp;848, says: “Elecampane was formerly employed as
a tonic, stimulant, diuretic, diaphoretic, expectorant, and emmenagogue, but
has now largely fallen into disuse.” One looks in vain in the standard textbooks
<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>on therapeutics for a description of the uses of inula (or elecampane),
and of its so-called “active principle,” helenin.</p>

<p>The circular to which reference has been made says, referring to the use
of castanea and passiflora in the treatment of whooping cough:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gelsemium, when made from the fresh, green plant&mdash;as is Merrell’s&mdash;is an excellent
adjuvant to the above drugs, and allays the nervous irritability so frequently present.”</p></div>

<p>H. C. Wood, Jr. (Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 1916, p.&nbsp;160), says of
gelsemium: “Gelsemium was originally employed as an arterial sedative and
febrifuge in the malarial fevers of the South, and subsequently in sthenic fevers.
It appears in some way to depress the bodily temperature, but it does not
appear probable that any advantage to be derived from it will counterbalance
the danger attending its employment in the large doses required. In asthma,
spasmodic laryngitis, whooping cough, and nervous cough it has been recommended
by Bartholow, but is little used.”</p>

<p>That is about as favorable a statement for the drug as is to be found in
the textbooks, and it serves to illustrate how little new there is in this mixture
of obsolete drugs that Merrell seeks to market as one possessing extraordinary
therapeutic value.</p>

<p>Even though the ingredients, or certain of them, were singly useful in the
treatment of those conditions for which Casta-Flora is recommended, no one
could possibly foresee the effect in any given case of such a jumble of drugs,
both active and inert, as is said to be represented in this preparation. The
prescribing of such mixtures, the action of which cannot in any way be
foreseen, is plain charlatanism.</p>

<p>In addition, the various drugs in Casta-Flora are present in such proportions
that the dose of each of the several ingredients bears no relation to
the commonly accepted dose.</p>

<p>Casta-Flora is not acceptable for New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From

<hr class="r16" />
<h3>FIRWEIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Firwein is a product of The Tilden Company, New Lebanon, N.&nbsp;Y. It is
sold under the claim that when swallowed it has a “predilection” both for the
bronchial mucosa and also for the genito-urinary organs. To quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Expectorant, Sedative, Antispasmodic in the Treatment of Inflammations of the Bronchial
and Genito-Urinary Mucosæ.”</p>

<p>“Firwein being a bland, soothing balsam possesses a wide range of adaptability and
increased potency because of its healing virtues and usefulness as an expectorant, sedative
and antispasmodic in bronchitis, and inflammation and catarrh of nose, throat and lungs.”</p>

<p>“Firwein has a special predilection for mucosæ, this being as marked in diseases of the
genito-urinary system as it is in the respiratory organs. In inflammatory diseases of the
genito-urinary organs, its bland, curative properties are exerted in a gratifying degree.
In cystitis and uritis it is clearly indicated<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Little information is given concerning the composition of Firwein. An old
circular says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Firwein contains Phosphorus, Iodin and Bromin finely blended with a balsameous elixir
made from the fir tree.”</p></div>

<p>From a more recent circular we quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Firwein is prepared from the inside fresh green bark of the fir tree&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span></p>
<p>The label on the product reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Firwein is pleasantly and effectively blended with salts of iodin and bromin, held in
solution with 20 per cent. alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>The therapeutic claims made for Firwein and the mystery enshrouding its
composition make it obvious that the product is intended to appeal to those
who are either thoughtless or ignorant. This is emphasized by the suggestion
that Firwein be combined with (1) cod liver oil (under the claim that it will
“promote the efficiency of the oil”), with (2) whisky for the treatment of
bronchorrhea of the aged, and with (3) syrup of hypo­phosphites for the treatment
of persistent bronchitis.</p>

<p>As the composition of Firwein is secret, the therapeutic claims unwarranted,
and its use irrational, the Council declared it inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 17, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>FIROLYPTOL PLAIN AND FIROLYPTOL WITH KREOSOTE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Firolyptol, another product of The Tilden Company, is, we are told, composed
of eucalyptol 10 drops, cottonseed oil <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> ounce and Firwein enough to
make 1 ounce. As the composition of Firwein is secret, it is evident that the
composition of Firolyptol is also unknown, except to the manufacturers. “Firolyptol
with Kreosote” is said to contain, in addition to whatever may be the
component parts of Firolyptol, 10 minims of creosote to each ounce. According
to an advertisement, Firolyptol with Kreosote is “antituberculous, antistrumous”
and “contains all the desired features of cod liver oil and is readily
assimilated.”</p>

<p>The advertisements of “Firolyptol Plain” and “Firolyptol with Kreosote”
seem to have for their key-note the assertion that cottonseed oil is a particularly
valuable nutriment and that when combined with constituents of Firolyptol
and Firolyptol with Kreosote becomes particularly valuable to the tuberculous.
To quote from an advertising circular:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now that the reconstructive properties of cottonseed oil are better appreciated by the
profession, the advantages that follow the administration of a palatable emulsion of this
strengthening and fattening food product are being demonstrated in hundreds of cases
where formerly reliance would have been placed in cod liver oil<span class="ell">...</span>. A recent writer
says that pure cottonseed oil is the greatest and purest vegetable oil known to chemistry,
and will do much toward revolutionizing the treatment of the <span class="lowercase smcap">GREAT WHITE PLAGUE</span><span class="ell">...</span>.
If the treatment of tuberculosis could resolve itself into the administration of a fatty substance
in a readily assimilated form, there would be no need for any part of <span class="lowercase smcap">FIROLYPTOL</span>
but the Cottonseed Oil<span class="ell">...</span>. The toxic material constantly produced in the system by
the germs of tuberculosis tend to expose it more and more to the ravages of the disease,
and the physiologic functions of the body suffer a constant depression. To neutralize this
germ activity with a consequent production of toxins it seems most logical to employ such
agents as have demonstrated their suitability for such purposes, for which reason Eucalyptol
and Kreosote with Firwein are incorporated in <span class="lowercase smcap">FIROLYPTOL</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The assertion that cottonseed oil is an especially valuable form of fat is
without warrant, but even if it were true the fat is available in cheap and
palatable forms in numerous other cottonseed oil products. It is unnecessary
to discuss the problematic value of creosote in the treatment of tuberculosis
or the value of eucalyptol (now generally abandoned), or even of the secret
mixture Firwein. Food and fresh air, not drugs, constitute the fundamentals
of the treatment of tuberculosis, and it is both irrational and detrimental to
the interests of the tuberculous to administer various potent agents in fixed
and unknown amounts with such simple articles of food as cottonseed oil.
Neither of these products is acceptable for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>&mdash;Firwein<a name="FNanchor_110_113" id="FNanchor_110_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_113" class="fnanchor">110</a> has been advertised to physicians for twenty-five
or thirty years and it is a sad commentary on the intelligence of our profession
that a preparation sold under such obviously false and misleading, not to say
silly, claims, should still be in existence. Firwein is claimed to “prevent waste
of tissue” in tuberculosis. If it had this power, it would have found its place
long ago among the few great agents in drug therapy. As a matter of fact,
Firwein has gained virtually no recognition outside of the “literature” of the
Tilden concern. The claims made for Firwein are a peculiar mixture of
studied candor&mdash;when the truth is not likely to hurt its sale&mdash;and inane vaporing&mdash;when
the facts would not redound to its credit. The Tilden Company
declares that “Firwein stands without a peer in its class.” But the company
adds 10 drops of eucalyptol and some cottonseed oil to this peerless product
and an improvement is born&mdash;“Firolyptol”! Then, to perfect the already
perfectly perfected, 10 drops of creosote are added to “Firolyptol” and the profession
is offered “Firolyptol with Kreosote”! In just what verbal pyrotechnics
the Tilden Company might indulge, should it decide to add ten drops of
something else to “Firolyptol with Kreosote,” one shudders to contemplate.</p>

<p>If we are accused of exhibiting undue levity in discussing a therapeutic
problem, we can only answer that it is impossible to consider seriously the
Charlie Chaplins of the nostrum world.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 17,

<h3>BINIODOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>In accordance with the usages of the Council, the report which appears
below along with the reports of the clinical investigation by Drs. Cole and
Keidel upon which the recommendations of the referee were based were sent to
the manufacturer for comment. The reply of the manufacturer contained no
evidence which justified the Council in modifying the action already taken.
Publication of the report was therefore authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Biniodol was submitted to the Council by the manufacturer, Charles C.
Yarbrough, Memphis, Tenn. The manufacturer claims the product is a solution
of 1 per cent. of red mercuric iodid and 2.75 per cent. of guaiacol in bland
vegetable oil. It is marketed with the implication that it is new and superior
to other oil solutions of mercuric iodid. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it is a straight solution of this mercurial compound, as no alkaline iodide or
other chemical is used to bring about the solution.” “<span class="ell">..</span>. It is probably the first and
only one-percent oil solution of straight mercury biniodide made in America<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>[The manufacturer, in a letter addressed to the secretary of the Council, explains: “By
straight solution, I mean that the solution of the red mercuric iodid is effected without the
aid of any alkaline iodid or other chemicals<span class="ell">...</span>. Biniodol was first offered early in
1912&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”]</p>

<p>“Biniodol is, therefore, superior and much to be preferred to other mercurials used for
like purposes. It is highly active thera­peutically, producing the desired effects, usually
without the inevitable disadvantages of other mercurials. It rarely causes salivation,
diarrhea, or other symptoms of mercurial intolerance, even when pushed to full therapeutic
effect and when given for a considerable period of time. Nor does it produce anemia.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>
<p>The Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association found that
Biniodol contained 1 per cent. of mercuric iodid and 2.5 per cent. of guaiacol;
hence the composition is essentially as claimed. It is not true, however, that
Biniodol is the “first and only one-percent solution of straight mercury biniodide
made in America.” As shown in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 9, 1914, p.&nbsp;2247,
formulas by Lemaire and Dunning for making a “straight” solution of mercuric
iodid were published in this country in 1909 and 1910, respectively. Moreover,
a 1 per cent. solution of mercuric iodid in oil is on the market and is described
in New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>To determine whether or not Biniodol is “superior and much to be preferred
to other mercurials used for like purposes,” the Council secured the cooperation
of the Department of Dermatology and Syphilology of the Western Reserve
University cooperating with the Cleveland City Hospital, and of the Johns
Hopkins Hospital. Each received three samples, labeled respectively, 1, 2
and 3: 1 contained Biniodol; 2, a 1 per cent. solution of mercuric iodid in oil;
3, a solution made up according to the formula of Biniodol, namely, 1 per
cent. of mercuric iodid and 2.5 per cent. of guaiacol in oil. All the solutions
were sterile. The investigators were not informed which preparation was
designated by the respective numbers, but they were asked to use the preparations
when intramuscular injections of a 1 per cent. oily solution of mercuric
iodid were indicated, and to note what differences, if any, were observed following
the use of the different solutions regarding pain, discomfort, induration
and any other evidences of effects of the medicaments.</p>

<p>The Cleveland investigator reports that the patients were more or less
confused in their replies to inquiries and gave rather indefinite and conflicting
answers. After carefully tabulating the replies, however, the following summary
resulted:</p>

<p class="ml1em fs85">
1 was worse than 2 or 3 in 6 cases.<br />
2 was worse than 1 or 3 in 5 cases.<br />
3 was worse than 2 or 1 in 1 case.<br />
</p>

<p>The report from Johns Hopkins records a series of 117 injections followed
by the estimated reactions recorded below:</p>

<p class="ml1em fs85">
1. Severe, 13; mild, 14; none, &#8199;4; unrecorded, 8 = 39<br />
2. Severe, &#8199;5; mild, 15; none, 16; unrecorded, 5 = 41<br />
3. Severe, &#8199;7; mild, 25; none, &#8199;3; unrecorded, 2 = 37<br />
</p>

<p>That is, when recorded in percentages:</p>

<p class="ml1em fs85">
1. (Biniodol) severe, 33.3; mild, 35.9; none, 10.3; unrecorded, 20.5.<br />
2. (Without guaiacol) severe, 12.2; mild, 36.8; none, 39.0; unrecorded, 12.2.<br />
3. (With guaiacol) severe, 18.9; mild, 67.5; none, 8.1; unrecorded, 5.5.<br />
</p>

<p>The manufacturer of Biniodol supplied the names of several physicians who
have used that preparation in their practice. Correspondence with these elicited
the following statements:</p>

<p>One had used Biniodol in forty-eight cases and states that “only a few
patients complain of pain at all and then only of a general soreness in the
muscle.” This physician reports a limited experience with the use of another
manufacturer’s “mercury biniodide oil solution” (apparently six cases), but
severe pain following the injections made it necessary to abandon that
preparation.</p>

<p>Another of these physicians named by the manufacturer, without reference
to any series of cases, reports that “Biniodol is superior to any [oily solution
of mercury biniodid] that I have tried.”</p>

<p>A third physician has “used it [Biniodol] a few times” and is “convinced
that it has no special action or virtue” over “any red mercuric iodide in oil.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span></p>
<p>This evidence, in its most favorable estimate, shows Biniodol to be a good
1 per cent. solution of mercuric iodid in oil, but fails to justify attributing to
the preparation any unique characteristics. The preparations made in the
laboratory were as satisfactory, or better than the Biniodol, and the presence
or absence of the guaiacol was of no consequence.</p>

<p>Biniodol conflicts with Rule 6, since claims of superior therapeutic efficiency
made for it are not established; and with Rules 8 and 10, since it is an
unessential modification of an established nonproprietary article marketed
under a proprietary name.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, the referee recommends that Biniodol be not
accepted for New and Non­official Remedies, and that this report, including
the clinical investigations of Drs. Cole and Keidel, be authorized for publication.</p>

<h3>COMPARATIVE SYMPTOMS RESULTING FROM THE USE
OF SEVERAL OILY SUSPENSIONS OF RED MERCURIC
IODID (MERCURY BINIODID)</h3>

<h4>Report of Dr. H. N. Cole<a name="FNanchor_D_114" id="FNanchor_D_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_114" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></h4>


<p>At the request of Prof. Torald Sollmann of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry of the American Medical Association, we made a comparative study
of several oily preparations of red mercuric iodid for intramuscular injections
in syphilis.</p>

<p>The information, concerning the preparations submitted to the investigators,
was as follows:</p>

<h5>OILY SOLUTION OF RED MERCURIC IODID</h5>

<p>“It is desired to ascertain whether there is any difference between three
preparations, each containing 1 per cent. of mercuric iodid, as to pain, discomfort,
induration, etc. The preparations will be labeled “1,” “2” and “3.” They
will be sterile.</p>

<p>“One of these preparations will be a plain solution in oil; another will
contain, in addition, 2.5 per cent. of guaiacol; the third will be a proprietary
preparation containing the guaiacol.</p>

<p>“It is also desirable to know how the oily solution compares with the plain
watery solution; but this is of secondary importance.”</p>

<p>The preparations all had the same appearance. The patients were taken
indiscriminately, and we attempted to keep them on the injections as long as
possible, in order to compare symptoms. Owing, however, to discharge from
hospital, symptoms of mercury intoxication, etc., we were unable in all cases
to give a thorough trial with each preparation.</p>

<p>In all, eleven patients were treated and seventy-one injections given&mdash;by
which time our experimental supply was exhausted.</p>

<p>In each case the drug was given intramuscularly in the buttocks and the
patients carefully observed for subjective symptoms of pain and for objective
symptoms of swelling, induration, abscess formation, etc. The details are
given in Table 1.</p>

<p>As will be noted, in several of the cases the patients were more or less
confused and gave rather indefinite and conflicting answers. In attempting
to compare the results from the different drugs, by careful tabulation one finds
that symptoms were more marked with the respective sample as follows:</p>

<p class="ml1em">Preparation 1 was worse than Preparation 2 or 3 in six cases.<br />
Preparation 2 was worse than Preparation 1 in two cases.<br />
Preparation 2 was worse than Preparation 3 in five cases.<br />
Preparation 3 was worse than Preparations 2 or 1 in one case.</p>

<p>The criticism may be raised that the number of cases and of injections is
too small to permit the drawing of any just conclusions. Even should we grant
it, the statistics certainly do not prove any marked superiority of any one of
the preparations over the others. We wish to thank Dr. Sollmann for advising
and directing us in this work, and Drs. Bailey, Bernstein, Markus and Reycraft
for assistance in carrying it out.</p>


<h4>Report of Dr. Albert Keidel</h4>

<p>Twenty cases were chosen at random from the syphilitic patients attending
the clinic. They were given intramuscular injections of the three solutions,
in amounts varying from 1 to 2&nbsp;c.c., at intervals (in most instances) of two
days. The injections were invariably made into the gluteal muscles, at depths
of from 2 to 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> inches, and ordinary care exercised to preserve asepsis. After
injection the patient was allowed to depart, and the result was recorded at the
succeeding visit. The result was determined from the patient’s statement and
our examination. Some patients received injections of only one solution;
some were treated with first one and later with another, and one patient received
all three at different times. The solutions were never mixed for a single
injection, of course.</p>

<p>The solutions are understood to contain a 1 per cent. solution of red
mercuric iodid in oil, two of them containing in addition 2.5 per cent. of
guaiacol, one of these being a proprietary preparation. The solutions are
designated as Preparations 1, 2 and 3, respectively, corresponding to the numbers
on the labels of the bottles in which they were originally received. The
local reactions are recorded as “severe” (S), “mild” (M), “none” (O) and
“Undetermined” (U). By “severe” is meant very severe pain lasting for
from several hours to several days; by “mild” is meant slight pain or numbness
for several hours, or less than an hour; “none” indicates that there was no
local reaction, and “undetermined,” that the patient has failed to return after
the last injection.</p>

<p>In Table 3 all the details of the investigation are recorded. Under “Local
Reaction,” the letters represent the type of reaction after each injection, in
the order in which they were given; when two solutions were used in the
same case, the letters represent the reactions following the solution opposite
which they stand. In the fifth column the plus and minus symbols indicate
the Wassermann reaction; plus indicates a completely positive, and minus a
completely negative reaction. When there is only one sign, it refers to the
reaction at the end of treatment; when there are two, to the reaction before
and after. The seventh column shows the clinical result at the end of treatment;
when no note is made, it means that there was no change noted. In
the eighth column are noted any objective results observed at the time of
examinations of the patients.</p>

<p>The injections were made and the result charted by Dr. E.&nbsp;L. Zimmermann,
of my staff, under my directions and supervision.&mdash;(<i>Abstracted in The Journal

<h3>CORPORA LUTEA (SOLUBLE EXTRACT), PARKE,
DAVIS &amp; CO.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Following inquiries, the Council took up for consideration “Corpora Lutea
(Soluble Extract),” marketed by Parke, Davis &amp; Co. in the form of ampules
and proposed for hypodermic administration. The report which appears below
was submitted to the Council by a committee, and was adopted by the Council.
Corpora Lutea (Soluble Extract) was declared inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, and publication of the report authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Corpora Lutea (Soluble Extract) has not been submitted by the manufacturer.
The information of the referee is based, therefore, on the claims made
in the trade package, and on the statements in the price list. These show
that the product is essentially secret and claims made for the actions and uses
of the preparation do not make clear the essentially experimental status of
the article, and are therefore misleading.</p>

<p><i>Conflict with Rule 1.</i>&mdash;No definite statement of composition appears beyond
the indefinite claim that it is an aqueous solution of “soluble Corpora Lutea
Extract,” each ampule corresponding to 0.2&nbsp;Gm. of desiccated gland. How
these soluble products are obtained, whether they represent <i>all</i> the water-soluble
principles, or whether some have been eliminated, are questions that
are not answered. Yet such information is essential to intelligent and scientific
use, for, as there is no method of standard­ization, the method of preparation
is the only mark of identity. For instance, we do not know at this time whether
proteins have anything to do with the supposed value of corpora lutea. It is,
therefore, essential to know whether or not the proteins have been eliminated.</p>

<p><i>Conflict with Rule 6.</i>&mdash;The circular in the package advises the hypodermic
use of this extract, not only in functional amenorrhea and the ordinary reflex
consequences of physiologic or artificial menopause, but also in:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“&#8239;‘neurasthenic’ symptoms during menstrual life”;</p>

<p>“sterility, not due to pyogenic infection or mechanical obstruction”;</p>

<p>“repeated abortions, not due to disease or mechanical factors”;</p>

<p>“hyperemesis in the early months of pregnancy.”</p></div>

<p>These are not stated merely as conditions in which various enthusiasts have
tried corpus luteum, but as conditions “for which it will be found serviceable.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to inform the medical profession that this statement is
calculated to raise expectations which cannot possibly be fulfilled. Even the
manufacturers seem to realize this; at least they speak somewhat indefinitely
of “suitable cases,” “good judgment,” “real indications,” etc. But they proceed
to nullify this warning&mdash;if it was intended as a warning&mdash;by their illustrations
of unsuitable cases, for instance, “amenorrhea due to extreme anemia, dysmenorrhea
due to cervical stenosis,” etc. Finally, they sum up the case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Therefore, additional emphasis on the necessity for the proper selection of cases is
essential in order that this useful preparation may not be unjustly discredited.”</p></div>

<p>How these cases of sterility, abortions, etc., are to be selected is not
revealed. In other words, the restriction is no more than a convenient device
by which every improvement is to be attributed to the medicine, and every
failure to the physician.</p>

<p>The referee recommends that Corpora Lutea (Soluble Extract), Parke,
Davis &amp; Co., be held ineligible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., because it is a secret preparation
advertised under extravagant claims.</p>

<h3>WHEELER’S TISSUE PHOSPHATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council held that the contribution from the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory,
“Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates,” demonstrates that this is a semisecret,
complex and irrational preparation, sold with misleading claims concerning its
medicinal constituents and therapeutic properties.</p>

<p>The Council directed that the report be included with the Annual Council
Reports and declared Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates in conflict with Rules 1,
6, 8 and 10.</p>

and Calisaya,” is advertised as a nerve food and a nutritive tonic. The
label states that it contains calcium, iron, sodium trihydrogen phosphates,
alkaloids of Peruvian bark with 12<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent. of alcohol. The preparation is
sold by the T.&nbsp;B. Wheeler, M.&nbsp;D. Co., of Rouses Point, New York. According
to the manufacturer, Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. is an <i>inorganic</i> combination of the phosphates of iron and calcium and hydrogen
(phosphoric acid) together with hydrochloric acid, hydrocyanic acid, and quinine, cheerful

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The iron is the green, inorganic phosphate and the calcium the simple white
phosphate of your early student days<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The preparation is a red liquid, having an acid reaction, a sweet-bitter
taste and the odor of wild cherry. Qualitative tests indicated the presence of
calcium, iron, a phosphate, a chlorid, a sulphate, quinin or cinchona alkaloids,
alcohol, sodium, cochineal coloring and invert sugar. Ammonium salts, glycerol,
citrates or lactates were not found. From the quantitative values obtained the
preparation may be taken to represent:</p>

<p class="tac fs85">* It should be understood that the calcium and iron salts are held in solution by the
hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The dose of Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates recommended by the manufacturer
is a tablespoonful or about 15&nbsp;c.c. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;oz.). The total calcium in a dose of
the preparation is equivalent to about one-sixth of an average dose of the
official calcium chlorid, and the total phosphate to each dose is equivalent to
about one-fourth of a dose of the official diluted phosphoric acid. Each prescribed
<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>dose of the preparation contains about 0.01&nbsp;gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>13</sub></span> grain) of iron
phosphate or about one twenty-fifth of the average dose, and to obtain a
Pharmacopeial dose of iron phosphate the patient would be obliged to take
three-fourths of the contents of an entire bottle&mdash;or 12 ounces&mdash;of the preparation.
If it be assumed that all of the chlorid present is in the form of free
hydrochloric acid, each dose of the preparation contains the equivalent of about
two-thirds of one Pharmacopeial dose of diluted hydrochloric acid. Each dose
of the preparation contains about 0.0062&nbsp;gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain) of quinin sulphate, or
about one-sixteenth of the average tonic dose. In other words, to obtain the
amount of quinin sulphate given in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia as the tonic dose,
the patient would be required to swallow 7<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> fluidounces of the proprietary
preparation, or the contents of nearly half a bottle. The fallacy of prescribing
Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates either for its quinin or its iron content is apparent.</p>

<p>Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates is, then, a mildly bitter flavored syrup which
contains nearly 12 per cent. of alcohol, small quantities each of calcium phosphate
and hydrochloric acid and insignificant amounts of iron and quinin salts.
In other words, essentially it is a sweetened solution of small quantities of
calcium phosphate in very dilute hydrochlorid acid together with 12 per
cent. of alcohol.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the analysis of the preparation, how ludicrous some of
the claims appear:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Tissue Phosphates</i> is not a hypo­phosphite preparation; it is not a combination of
glycero­phosphates or other organic salts, or so-called peptonates and manganates, all recently
condemned by the best therapeutic opinion here and in Europe, as much slower and less
active than the simpler salts. The iron is the green, inorganic phosphite and the calcium
the simple white phosphate of your early student days. Nature takes these simple salts
and builds them rapidly into lecithin, bone, and other tissue, without the delay incurred
by splitting up the organic salts before she can recombine them.”</p>

<p>“Tissue phosphates is in fact a <i>chemical food</i>.”</p>

<p>“The formula, suggested by Professor Dusart, of Paris, combines in an easily assimilable
and agreeable cordial; medium medicinal doses of Phosphorus, the Generator of Nerve Force;
Calcium Phosphate, for Cell Development and Nutrition; Sodium Phosphate, a stimulant of
Liver and Pancreas and Corrective of Acid Fermentation in the Alimentary Canal; Iron, generating
in the Blood, Heat and Motion, Phosphoric Acid, Tonic in Sexual Debility; Alkaloids
of Calisaya, Antimalarial and Antipyretic; Extract of Wild Cherry, Tonic, yet Calming Irritation
and Diminishing Nervous Excitement; Ethyl Alcohol 12.5%; and Aromatics.”</p></div>

<p>Although the claim is made that the “formula” of Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates
has been “suggested by Professor Dusart,” such of Dusart’s papers as
were available in this <span class="nowrap">country<a name="FNanchor_111_115" id="FNanchor_111_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_115" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> failed to disclose any “formula” that was at
all comparable to this product.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>&mdash;The investigation verifies facts that must be obvious to
every physician who has given the matter thought. “Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates”
is an unscientific, shotgun mixture whose most active and powerful
drug is the alcohol it contains. That it was not years ago relegated to the
realms of obsolete and discarded preparations is a commentary alike on the lack
of scientific discrimination and the persuasive power of advertising. While
in the past “Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates” has been advertised extensively in
medical journals, it seems that now the chief, if not the only beneficiary of
the advertising appropriation for this product is the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>,
which weekly heralds the “Delicious” and “Sustaining” qualities of “The Ideal
Tonic for Fastidious Convalescents.”]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 5,

<h3>THE CLAIMED GALACTAGOGUE EFFECTS OF NUTROLACTIS
AND GOAT’S RUE NOT SUBSTANTIATED</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Specific lactagogues&mdash;drugs which stimulate the secretion of milk&mdash;are
unknown to science. Yet medical publications give space to advertisements of
a proprietary&mdash;“Nutrolactis”&mdash;which is said to increase the milk supply of
nursing mothers. Since dependence on a preparation of this kind is likely to
cause neglect of the only means of increasing a scanty milk supply of nursing
mothers&mdash;care of the general health and a sufficient quantity of proper food&mdash;this
proprietary and the drug “goat’s rue,” (<i>Galega officinalis</i>) which the
proprietors hint as being the potent constituent, were subjected to a critical
study to determine their possible influence on milk secretion. For this purpose
the Council secured the help of A.&nbsp;J. Carlson, Ph.D., professor of physiology,
University of Chicago. Dr. Carlson, with the aid of A. Woelfel, M.D., and
Marian Lewis, Sc.M., undertook to estimate the effect of Nutrolactis and of
goat’s rue on nursing dogs and goats with the intention of extending the
study to nursing mothers if the animal experiments so warranted. The contribution,
“The Alleged Galactagogue Action of Galega and Nutrolactis,” by
Marian Lewis and A.&nbsp;J. Carlson from the Hull Physiological Laboratory of the
University of Chicago, which appears below, shows that Nutrolactis and goat’s
rue are without influence on the milk secretion in nursing animals.</p>

<p>The Council endorsed the work of Lewis and Carlson and held that the
claimed galactagogue effects of Nutrolactis and goat’s rue are not substantiated.</p>

<h3>THE ALLEGED GALACTAGOGUE ACTION OF GALEGA AND NUTROLACTIS&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_E_116" id="FNanchor_E_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_116" class="fnanchor">[E]</a><a name="FNanchor_F_117" id="FNanchor_F_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_117" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></h3>

<p>It is well established that the food best adapted to the energy and growth
requirements of the infant is normal mother’s milk. Any decrease in quantity
or deterioration in quality of the maternal secretion is soon followed by a
parallel impairment of growth, loss of weight, or lowered resistance to infection
in the infant. The widespread occurrence of deficient milk secretion is
a matter of common knowledge. The discovery of true lactagogues, or specific
substances which increase the quantity and quality of the milk on being
administered to nursing mothers, would therefore be of very great importance.
In view of this great medical and economic interest in true lactagogues it is
not surprising to find that the medical and biologic literature records discoveries
of lactagogues based on hope rather than demonstration, and that spurious
lactagogues are on the market.</p>

<p>Some of the factors known to affect milk secretion are general health,
food supply, psychic state, and heredity. The mechanism of secretion and the
method by which these factors affect it are imperfectly understood. In general
it has been observed that milk yield improves both in quantity and in quality
with improvement in general health, better food supply, and more favorable
psychic state. The influence of heredity is taken advantage of by dairymen
who are well acquainted with the potential milk production of the different
breeds of cattle.</p>

<p>Among the substances which have been reported to stimulate milk secretion
may be mentioned the extract of the posterior lobe of the hypophysis. But
pituitary extract is not a true lactagogue, because its action is confined to
the smooth musculature of the gland ducts, causing a more or less complete
<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>ejection of the milk already formed; it has no effect on the gland cells or the
actual secretory process in the direction of increasing the milk yield. Extracts
of thymus, corpus luteum, ovaries, uterus, placenta, fetus, and the mammary
gland itself have also been reported to have a temporary stimulating effect on
the quantity of milk secreted, but when these extracts are given by mouth
they are apparently without specific influence on the mammary gland.</p>

<p>Galega, or goat’s rue (<i>Galega officinalis</i>), is an herb described in the National
Formulary as being slightly bitter and astringent. In 1873, Gillet-Damotti<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_112_118" id="FNanchor_112_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_118" class="fnanchor">112</a></span>
in a communication to the French Academy, stated that this plant when fed
to cows increases the secretion of milk from 35 to 50 per cent. Other French
writers have affirmed that goat’s rue is a lactagogue. In Germany, <span class="nowrap">Fragner<a name="FNanchor_113_119" id="FNanchor_113_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_119" class="fnanchor">113</a></span>
made a preparation called Galegal, using galega as the active principle and
combining it with lactose to give it a pleasant taste and make it soluble in
water, milk, coffee, and tea. This preparation was reported on favorably by
Scherer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_114_120" id="FNanchor_114_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_120" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> who asserts that he obtained positive results in fifty-four of the
eighty cases in which he used it.</p>

<p>More recently <span class="nowrap">Huët<a name="FNanchor_115_121" id="FNanchor_115_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_121" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> tested the effects of Theinhardt’s Hygiama lactogene
on four lactating women. This preparation is said to be composed of hygiama<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_116_122" id="FNanchor_116_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_122" class="fnanchor">116</a></span>
galega and anise. Analysis showed that it contains albumins, fat, soluble and
insoluble carbohydrates, salts and water. Huët could not observe any influence
from the use of this preparation, either on the quantity or on the composition
of the milk secreted.</p>

<p>Nutrolactis<a name="FNanchor_117_123" id="FNanchor_117_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_123" class="fnanchor">117</a> is a commercial preparation sold by the Nutrolactis Company
of New York at $1 a bottle. The label states that it contains 5 per cent. of
alcohol; that it contains fluid extracts of the family of “galactagogic plants,”
and that it is intended to “increase the supply of mother’s milk.” It is recommended
to maintain “quality and quantity until the end of normal lactation.”
Nutrolactis is also recommended for a mother debilitated by lactation. It is
claimed that “Nutrolactis does not <i>force</i> the secretion of milk but merely
assists such secretion.” Years ago <span class="nowrap">Millbank<a name="FNanchor_118_124" id="FNanchor_118_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_124" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> reported good results from the
use of Nutrolactis. After more than a year’s use he concluded that it was
more satisfactory than any other lactagogue hitherto employed by him, which
is not saying very much, as specific lactagogues are as yet unknown. Nutrolactis
is still (1916) extensively advertised in various medical journals as a
lactagogue.</p>


<h5>METHODS OF INVESTIGATION</h5>

<p>The alleged lactagogue action of galega and Nutrolactis was tested on
lactating dogs and goats. In these animals the psychic factors, or suggestion,
are largely eliminated. If the results had been positive or had indicated
lactagogue action, the test would have been extended to nursing women. The
puppies and kids were weighed before and after nursing and a record kept of
the amount of milk obtained at each nursing (the animals nursing from three
to five times daily). The mothers were fed with varying doses of the drugs,
and the milk yield compared with that of a control period during which no
drugs were administered. An effort was made to keep the conditions of the
experiments uniform throughout.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span></p>
<p>The galega was ground and mixed with the food. The Nutrolactis was
mixed with food given by the stomach tube, or in some cases with a spoon.
Galega was tested on two goats and Nutrolactis on one goat and nine dogs.
The results are given herewith:</p>

<h5>COMMENT AND CONCLUSION</h5>

<p>Goat 1 had already been lactating for over two months, and the yield was
gradually decreasing at the time the observations were begun. The administration
of galega did not check this decrease. Goat 2 should have been a very
favorable subject, for the kid was about a week old at the time the observations
were begun. Both galega and Nutrolactis caused a decrease in milk yield of
this animal. This decrease is perhaps partly due to the animal’s distaste for
the drugs and her consequent failure to eat as well as during the control
periods.</p>

<p>Administration of Nutrolactis was accompanied by an increase in milk
in only two animals, Dog 4 and Dog 5. A detailed examination of the records
of these two dogs shows that in both cases <i>there was a progressive increase
in milk yield during the control period</i> and that administration of the drug
failed to accelerate this increase. On the contrary, the curve for Dog 5 takes
a sudden drop immediately after the first administration of the drug.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span></p>
<p>The records of Dogs 6 and 7 show that the yield during the second control
period is lower than that of the preceding periods. Although the administration
of the drug in both cases was followed by a decrease in the yield, it may be
urged that the drug has some lactagogue action, for its discontinuance was
followed by a decrease in yield. This effect, however, is also apparent rather
than real, for the data show a gradual falling off in yield during the period
of administration of the drug, which decrease was not accelerated by withdrawing
the drug.</p>

<p>Our data show that galega and Nutrolactis, when taken by mouth, and the
elements of suggestion excluded, had no beneficial effect on lactation&mdash;at least
in so far as the quantity of milk is concerned.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>THE RUSSELL EMULSION AND THE RUSSELL PREPARED
GREEN BONE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on “The Russell Emulsion” and “The Russell Prepared
Green Bone,” marketed by the Standard Emulsion Company, was submitted to
the Council by a referee. The Council endorsed the report and authorized its
publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Russell Emulsion is put up in a neat package and advertised in an
attractive pamphlet, on the cover of which we are told: “Truth Always
Justifies The Superlative Degree.” As what follows in the booklet and in the
printed circulars certainly does not lack superlatives, this is doubtless a
warning.</p>

<p>In addition to the pamphlet and circular advertising, the product seems to
be systematically boomed by a lecture scheme in which one Dr. Hague talks
before medical societies and distributes advertising matter. The lecture is succeeded
by a follow-up letter scheme through which matter is sent to members
of the society. Hague ostensibly discusses “lime starvation in tuberculosis,”
but medical societies soon learned to estimate his work as essentially to
advertise the Russell products. Last April the Medical Society of the State of
Pennsylvania sent out a circular letter to its county organizations on the
subject of the Russell-Hague propaganda which opens in this way:</p>

<p>“You have doubtless received a letter from Dr. William Grant Hague of
New York, offering to address your county society on Tuberculosis. After
due investigation, it is respectfully suggested that it may not be desirable
to ask him to address your society<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>The statements in the pamphlet and circular published are typical of the
whole method of exploitation. For example, can such claims as these be surpassed
by the veriest quack?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Science</span> cannot improve the means employed in producing <span class="smcap">The Russell Emulsion</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Genius</span> has not devised better methods than are used in manufacturing <span class="smcap">The Russell
Emulsion</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Money</span> cannot buy better products than are used in <span class="smcap">The Russell Emulsion</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Experience</span> cannot suggest a more nutritious combination of fats than we use in <span class="smcap">The
Russell Emulsion</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The emulsion is said to be made of equal parts of beef-fat, coconut, peanut
and cottonseed oils, held in suspension by albumin. The latter we are told is
applied to each globule of the emulsion by an “elaborate technical process”
devised by Dr. Russell. The mixture is everywhere spoken of as a “physiological”
<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>emulsion, but the word is always in quotation marks. Why it is
called “physiological” is not clear, but the term may be counted on to impress
the unthinking or the unscientific.</p>

<p>Numerous false and exaggerated statements are made about this “physiological”
emulsion with reference to food value. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The nutritional value of fats differ; the nutritional value of these fats and their increased
efficiency by combination over all others have been determined by extensive clinical observation.”</p></div>

<p>And also:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Russell Emulsion is approximated in food value by no other emulsion or food product
in existence.”</p>

<p>“A ‘physiological’ emulsion is a predigested food. It is absorbed with little assistance
from the digestive juices, and with no waste of energy. It is, therefore, the ideal food&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>These are sample statements found in the pamphlet and accompanying
circular. A dozen or more pathologic conditions are mentioned in which this
“ideal food” is specifically indicated; but we find, also, this curious statement:
“Patients can rarely take this dose [speaking of the maximum dose of 2 ounces
night and morning] for more than three or four weeks without showing
symptoms of over-feeding.” This unguarded remark about an ingestion of
48 grams of fat daily prompts one to ask what is wrong with the “ideal
predigested food.”</p>

<p>Russell is wedded to the idea that “lime starvation” is the main factor in
tuberculosis, and insists on the importance of large amounts of fat for the
“lime starved.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Russell was the original interpreter of the Lime Starved State and originated The
Lime Starvation Treatment in Tuberculosis. He also first pointed out and emphasized the
therapeutic importance of regarding the combination of lime phosphate and casein, as
brought down by the rennet enzyme, as a chemical union.”</p></div>

<p>This overworked lime-starvation theory certainly lacks any tangible confirmation
(see in this connection a recent paper by Halverson, Mohler and
Bergeim, in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, May 5, 1917), and to urge it to promote the sale of
a fat preparation is preposterous. On the uninitiated the exaggerated pseudo-scientific
language of the pamphlet and circular advertisement will probably
make some impression. Unfortunately such things count not only with the
layman who, having no technical knowledge of physiology, cannot be expected
to weigh the evidence but also with those medical men who, while scientifically
educated, are influenced by unscientific claims when plausibly presented. The
pamphlet is a striking example of a style which is dangerous because it smacks
of science.</p>

<p>The Russell Company sells also a mixture called “Prepared Green Bone,”
said to be made by partially digesting ground chicken bones with hydrochloric
acid and pepsin and adding glycerin at the end of the digestion. The product
is a sticky, unappetizing looking mass, put up in little earthenware boxes and
advertised as a lime food, apparently to go along with the fat emulsion. The
greater value of a few glasses of milk daily is evidently overlooked.</p>

<p>“The Russell Emulsion” and “The Prepared Green Bone” were declared
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Comment.</span>&mdash;There are always those who are ready to exploit the
unfortunate tuberculous. It is, unfortunately, a fact that many physicians accept
as true, statements clothed with obscure and voluminous quasi-scientific
verbiage. Such men would laugh at the bald claim that the moon is made of
green cheese; when, however, one plausibly and with due solemnity, affirms
<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>that the nocturnal luminous earthly satellite is composed of an infinite aggregation
of molecules of bewildering and awe-compelling complexity, built up
from the recently discovered polypeptids, the whole being of a verdant tint,
the person addressed looks impressed and opines that it sounds reasonable!
The advertising for The Russell Emulsion and The Russell Prepared Green
Bone is dangerous because it appeals to the thoughtless&mdash;layman and physician,
alike.]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 23, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>BROM-I-PHOS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Brom-I-Phos (National Drug Company, Philadelphia) was submitted to
the Council with a label bearing the following statement:</p>

<p class="tac fs85">“&#8239;‘ALCOHOL 25 PER CENT.’</p>

<p class="tac fs85">COMPOSITION&mdash;Per Fluidounce</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>A request for further information in regard to the composition of Brom-I-Phos
was sent to the National Drug Company. It was suggested that since
the preparation cannot contain the stated amounts of free bromin, free iodin
and free phosphorus, the form of combination in which these elements are
present should be set forth. In reply, the firm said, first, that “Brom-I-Phos
consists of Bromin, Iodin, Phosphorus, Glycerin, Wine, Water and Volatile
Oils. The Iodin is rubbed up with a small percentage of Potassium Iodid and
95 per cent. Alcohol, which solution is mixed with a solution of Bromine and
Spirits of Phosphorus which are combined with the base and aromatics.” The
manufacturer also admitted that phosphorus reacts with bromin and iodin and
that other reactions might occur, but maintained that it was “justified in
assuming the greater part, if not all of these elements, are actually existent in
the nascent state,” and asserted that its “printed formula complies with our
working formula in point of quantities involved as well as existence of elements
in an uncombined state.”</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported, on the contrary, that no free
phosphorus, free bromin or free iodin could be found in Brom-I-Phos, and that
no bromate or iodate could be found; bromid and iodid were present. The
addition of silver nitrate to an acidulated portion, diluted with water, gave
an amount of silver halid roughly agreeing with that which would be obtained
had the claimed amount of bromin and iodin (together with some potassium
iodid) been used in the preparation of Brom-I-Phos and in the process of
manufacture become converted to bromid and iodid.</p>

<p>The Council declared Brom-I-Phos inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, for conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6, 8 and 10.</p>

<p>The statement of composition is unsatisfactory and misleading in that it
suggests that the preparation contains bromin, iodin and phosphorus in the
free (elementary) state. The presence of the potent elementary phosphorus
is especially suggested by the small amounts of “phosphorus” declared.</p>

<p>The following statement on the label of the trade package constitutes an
indirect advertisement to the public:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“INDICATIONS: Scrofula, Coryza, Hay Fever Necrosis, Bronchial and Throat Affections,
Catarrhal Pneumonia, Glandular enlargements of the Spleen, Thyroid, and Lymphatics,
Rickets and Syphilis.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span></p>
<p>The following claims are therapeutic exaggerations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Ideal Alterative”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. indicated in all cases where an alterative is desired&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“The association of Bromin with Iodin in Brom-I-Phos materially enhances the product
in the treatment of chronic affections of the skin, depraved conditions of the mucous membranes,
tertiary syphilis, glandular enlargements, etc.”</p></div>

<p>In that it suggests that the phosphorus in Brom-I-Phos is more readily
assimilated than ordinary phosphate, the following is misleading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Phosphorus contained in Brom-I-Phos is readily assimilated and at once acts as a
nutrient to the nervous and osseous structures of the body, stimulates metabolism and
increases mental activity.”</p></div>

<p>The recommendation: “Your specification of Brom-I-Phos in the treatment
of Syphilitic cases will immediately prove beneficial to the patient” is not
supported by evidence. The name does not indicate that Brom-I-Phos is an
alcoholic preparation with iodid as its essential constituent, but suggests that
phosphorus is an important constituent, whereas the amount of phosphate or
phosphite, produced by the action of iodin on elementary phosphorus (if the
amount of phosphorus used in making the preparation is correctly stated) is
insignificant.</p>

<p>The combination of bromin, iodin and phosphorus, or bromid, iodid and phosphate,
is irrational because these elements are not of mutual assistance to each
other in the conditions for which Brom-I-Phos is advertised.</p>

<p>The Council’s report was submitted to the manufacturer of Brom-I-Phos
for comment; the reply contained nothing to permit a revision of the previous
conclusions.</p>

<p>The Council declared Brom-I-Phos inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 30, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>CREOSOTE-DELSON AND CREOFOS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Creosote-Delson and Creofos, or Creosote with Hypo­phosphites, were submitted
by the Delson Chemical Co., Inc., New York City. Creosote-Delson
is said to be “beechwood creosote from which the irritating and caustic properties
are removed by fractional distillation.” It is claimed that Creofos
contains “2 grains of Creosote-Delson and 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub></span> grains of the combined Hypo­phosphites
in each fluidrachm of the mixture or emulsion, the lime salt
predominating.” It is also claimed that “the primary object of the hypo­phosphites
in this preparation is that of maintaining the refined creosote in a pure,
unoxidized state, and that no particular claim for therapeutic action on their
part is advanced.” It is explained further, however, “the addition of the lime
was prompted by the belief <span class="ell">..</span>. that the fundamental cause of pulmonary
tuberculosis is lime starvation<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>The assertions are made that Creosote-Delson is superior to the official
creosote because it can be taken “abundantly and persistently without harm
to or interference with stomach and kidneys” and can be “taken uninterruptedly
and indefinitely,” while the dosage is “unlimited by any former
knowledge of Creosote Therapy.” Creosote-Delson is not on the market except
in the combination Creofos, although it is supplied on request.</p>

<p>Creofos is advised in the treatment of tuberculosis, whooping cough, measles,
“Grippe and Colds,” bronchitis, asthma, “Intestinal Affections (Colitis, Summer
Diarrhoea, etc.),” while its use is suggested for the “prevention of the
<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>spread of contagious diseases,” and for “preventing contagion in minor contagious
diseases at any rate, in schools and families.”</p>

<p>The following advertisement has recently appeared in the <i>New York
Medical Journal</i> and in the <i>Therapeutic Gazette</i>:</p>

<h5>CREOFOS MEDICATION</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>is the successful development of the most advanced practice in the treatment
of infectious diseases. It destroys completely the causative organisms
by a bactericide many times more powerful than phenol, yet absolutely
harmless to animal life.</p>

<p>Unlike serums, its activity is not confined to any specific disease, and
its use insures against sequelae (as pneumonia following grippe).</p>

<p>Especially valuable in the treatment of infants and patients of delicate
constitution and in cases where time is of importance.</p></div>

<p>The Delson Chemical Co. was requested to supply information regarding
the identity of Creosote-Delson and to support the claim that although it is
“the whole drug” its dosage is “unlimited by any former knowledge of Creosote
Therapy.” The reply was virtually an admission that the toxic, caustic, phenolic
components of creosote were present in Creosote-Delson just as in the official
creosote.</p>

<p>The referee of the Committee on Therapeutics in submitting his report to
the Council pointed out that it is difficult to discuss the pharmacologic merits
of a semisecret preparation, like Creosote-Delson, claimed to be more acceptable
to the human organism than the official product it is intended to supplant,
when the action of the parent drug is still questioned or disputed by eminent
clinicians.</p>

<p>Absorption experiments have been carried out with creosote and creosote
compounds, such as creosote with hypo­phosphites or calcium or creosote carbonate,
chiefly by a study of the elimination products in the urine. But any
evidence so far offered that these combinations increase absorption and lessen
the irritating, caustic or toxic properties has been wholly inconclusive. The
evidence offered by the Delson Chemical Co. presented no control experiments
with the official creosote and did not prove that either Creosote-Delson or
Creofos was less toxic than a corresponding amount of ordinary beechwood
creosote.</p>

<p>The referee concluded that no proof had been offered that these preparations
are materially superior to ordinary creosote preparations from the pharmacologic
or therapeutic standpoint, and that the claims made for Creosote-Delson
and Creofos are unwarranted in the light of our knowledge of the properties
of creosote. The advertisement quoted above is an example of unproved
and unwarranted claims.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the referee, the Council declared Creosote-Delson
and Creofos inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies, for conflict with
the rules as follows:</p>

<p><i>Creosote-Delson</i>: The information so far available is not sufficient to define
the nature, or composition, of Creosote-Delson, or to indicate in how far this
product differs, if at all, from the official creosote (conflict with Rule 1). No
methods are furnished for determining the identity or composition of Creosote-Delson
(conflict with Rule 2). The available information does not show that
Creosote-Delson has advantages over creosote (conflict with Rule 6).</p>

<p><i>Creofos</i>: The composition of Creosote-Delson not having been furnished,
the statement concerning the composition of Creofos is also unsatisfactory
(conflict with Rule 1). The therapeutic claims are unsubstantiated and grossly
exaggerated (conflict with Rule 6). The name is not descriptive of its composition
as is required for pharmaceutical mixtures (conflict with Rule 8). There
is no evidence that hypo­phosphites prevent decomposition of creosote (if this
<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>occurs). Hence the inclusion of hypo­phosphites must be considered irrational
(conflict with Rule 10).</p>

<p>The Council’s report was sent to the Delson Chemical Co. for consideration.
The firm’s reply contained nothing to warrant a revision of the report, and the
Council voted that Creosote-Delson and Creofos were inadmissible to New
and Non­official Remedies and authorized the publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>TRINER’S AMERICAN ELIXIR OF BITTER WINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine is a wine to which bitter drugs
and laxatives have been added. Though evidently intended for public consumption,
it is also advertised to physicians, and consequently the Council publishes
this report.</p>

<p>Some recent advertisements read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It Acts Well and Is Very Palatable. These are the reasons why so many physicians
recommend <span class="lowercase smcap">TRINER’S AMERICAN ELIXIR OF BITTER WINE</span>. Free from any chemicals. Prepared
from bitter herbs roots and barks of eminent medicinal value and pure natural red wine. A
safe relief in auto-intoxication, constipation, weakness, etc. Price $1.00. At drug Stores.
Samples gratis upon request only to physicians.”</p>

<p>“A Laxative Tonic. In cases of constipation and its sequelæ, autointoxication, weakness
and nervousness you should try <i>Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine</i>. This preparation
consists of Cascara Sagrada, Dandelion, Gentian Root, with Licorice in Pure Red Wine as
a base, with Aromatics.”</p></div>

<p>Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine is put up in bottles said to hold 1
pint, 5<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> fluidounces. The label declares the presence of from 16 to 18 per
cent. alcohol by volume, and states that “no special tax is required by the laws
of the U.&nbsp;S. for the sale of this medicinal preparation.” The circular contains
the following recommendations for its use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. It should be used in all cases calling for a safe evacuation of the bowels,
without weakening the body or causing any pain or other discomfort; in loss of appetite,
nervousness and weakness.”</p>

<p>“Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine consists of two principal ingredients, viz.,
Red Wine and Medicinal Herbs.”</p>

<p>“Red Wine strengthens the intestines and regulates their work. It also increases the
appetite, stimulates and strengthens the body.”</p>

<p>“Use Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine always when a thorough cleaning out
of the intestines is needed. Arrange the dose to suit your condition and habits.”</p>

<p>“In Chronic Constipation the dose of Triner’s American Elixir of Bitter Wine should
be increased or taken oftener.”</p>

<p>“Many Female Troubles are caused or aggravated by constipation and ladies should
always pay good attention to this fact.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to Triner’s Elixir of Bitter Wine, the circular&mdash;in English,
Polish, Russian, Spanish and other languages&mdash;advises the use of Triner’s
Angelica Bitter Tonic, Triner’s Red Pills, Triner’s Liniment and Triner’s
Cough Sedative.</p>

<p>The composition of this “wine”&mdash;some bitter drugs, a laxative and a tannin-containing,
constipating red wine&mdash;and advertising propaganda all tend to the
continued use of this alcoholic stimulant and thus to the unconscious formation
of a desire for alcoholic stimulation. As the medical journal advertisements
may lead physicians to prescribe this secret and irrational preparation and thus
unconsciously lead to alcoholism, the Council authorized publication of this
report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 14, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>TRIMETHOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Trimethol is the trade name for a substance said to be trimethyl-methoxy-phenol
of the formula C<sub>6</sub>H(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OCH<sub>3</sub>).OH&mdash;1:2:4:5:6, originated by
J.&nbsp;T. Ainslie Walker. It is sold as a nontoxic germicide, having a Rideal-Walker
phenol-coefficient of 40, even in the intestinal canal. It is described as
insoluble in water and not to be decomposed in the alimentary tract, and to
be excreted unchanged in the feces.</p>

<p>Trimethol itself is not obtainable. Pharmaceutical preparations&mdash;Trimethol
Syrup, Trimethol Capsules and Trimethol Tablets, said to contain Trimethol&mdash;are
prepared by The Walker-Leeming Laboratories and sold by Thos. Leeming
and Co., New York.</p>

<p>Trimethol preparations are advertised for use in all conditions dependent
on intestinal putrefaction. The advertising claims made are very extensive
and some of them give to “Trimethol” the scope of a panacea. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Physicians are constantly reporting cases where Trimethol has been especially efficient,
and describing conditions (until recently not associated with intestinal infection) which
have been distinctly benefited by its use. This would seem to bear out the contentions
of Charcot and Metchnikoff that 90% of all human ailments have their origin in intestinal
infection.</p>

<p>“The careful practitioner, when in doubt, will bear this in mind, now that we have a
really efficient and non-toxic intestinal germicide&mdash;not a mere antiseptic.”</p></div>

<p>The Walker-Leeming Laboratories have not formally requested the Council
to consider the Trimethol preparations, though in a personal letter to a member
of the Council J.&nbsp;T. Ainslie Walker invited an investigation of his compound.</p>

<p>For the investigation of Trimethol and its preparation the Council secured
the aid of a bacteriologist who has given much attention to the study of the
intestinal flora. The Walker-Leeming Laboratories and J.&nbsp;T. Ainslie Walker
were both asked to submit details of experimental studies and also to furnish
a supply of the pure “Trimethol.” But the only data sent that had any
definiteness set forth the bacterial counts made of plate cultures of stools of
one patient before and after the administration of Trimethol Capsules.</p>


<h5>REFUSE TO FURNISH TRIMETHOL</h5>

<p>The request for the pure substance was refused, on the grounds that the
substance was not used in the undiluted form. The failure to furnish the
chemical substance claimed as the essential constituent of the Trimethol preparations
is to be deprecated if indeed it has not greater significance. At least
it made it impossible for the Council’s expert to express his results in terms
of absolute Trimethol of established composition. The data obtained apply only
to the market preparations claimed to contain Trimethol. So far as the investigation
and report go, “Trimethol” is a hypothetical substance.</p>

<p>Clinical or animal tests of the asserted intestinal antiseptics have hitherto
given equivocal results because it is impossible, on the one hand, to predict
the course of any intestinal infection, or, on the other hand, to determine what
effect, if any, was produced by administration of the medicament. It therefore
seemed unwise to undertake this line of investigation until the more direct
laboratory bacteriologic methods had been exhausted. Consequently the investigator
checked, in the first place, the phenol coefficient of one of the Trimethol
preparations and then also determined its “penetrability” coefficient. Although
by both methods Trimethol was found to be a germicide, the results did not
indicate any remarkable potency or other properties suggesting that the drug
possessed special therapeutic value. From the results obtained it appeared
inadvisable to proceed further with the work until more definite evidence of
<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>the nature and of the value of the substance should be at hand. The report
of the bacteriologic investigation follows:</p>


<h5>THE BACTERIOLOGIST’S REPORT</h5>

<p>“I have made no attempt to study the effects of internal administration of
Trimethol on the intestinal flora. The methods available at the present time
of enumerating the numbers of <i>viable</i> bacteria in the feces are probably not
accurate within 100 per cent. and the precision of such determinations is equally
variable. The physiologic factors involved are so complex that they would
appear to make a really valuable assay a question of many months’ careful
study. If it were possible to administer known amounts of Trimethol, as
such, the problem might be worth while; inasmuch as the available reactive
substance is not at present quantitatively assayable, this phase of the investigation
barely seems practicable.</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Trimethol Syrup,’ as such, appears to be about 10 per cent. as efficient
in its germicidal value as carbolic acid. If the assay, <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;m. Trimethol per drm.
(as the label indicates), is correct, the substance would appear to possess
germicidal merit provided enough could be administered, if it is not influenced
by passage through the stomach.</p>

<p>“A package containing four four-ounce bottles labeled ‘Trimethol, A Non-Toxic
Germicide SYRUP Representing <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;m. Trimethol per drm., Alcohol
1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent.’ was received at the laboratory Dec. 15, 1916. Later a smaller
package containing, according to the label, 100 Trimethol tablets, each 5&nbsp;gr.,
representing 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;m. Trimethol, was received. The tablets were apparently
chocolate coated.</p>

<p>“Two separate series of tests were made upon the syrup. (<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Phenol
coefficient</span>, using the method outlined in <i>Bulletin No. 82</i>, Hygienic Laboratory,
Method of Standardizing Disinfectants With and Without Organic Matter.
(<i>b</i>) A <span class="smcap">Penetrability coefficient</span> by the method of Kendall and Edwards,
<i>Journal of Infectious Diseases</i>, <b>8</b>, 250.</p>

<p>“The former method compares the viability of naked germs in a 1 per cent.
carbolic acid solution as a standard, with various dilutions of the germicide to
be tested. The latter measures the relative diffusibility and germicidal power
of carbolic acid and various dilutions of the germicide to be tested upon
<i>Bacillus coli</i> suspended in 1.2 per cent. agar which is molded in cylinders of
one centimeter diameter after infection with the organism.</p>

<p>“The first method&mdash;phenol coefficient&mdash;possesses advantages and disadvantages
which are well known and need no mention here. It is worthy of
notice, however, that as the death rate of the bacteria increases during the
progress of the test, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a uniform
suspension of living organisms so that each loopful removed shall exactly
represent the developmental potentiality of the residual organisms.</p>

<p>“The second method theoretically covers the possibility because all the
organisms are immobilized and are exposed to the germicide in direct proportion
to its diffusibility until the center of the agar mass is reached, where the
residual viable bacteria are presumably located. Inasmuch as the penetrability
of an intestinal mass is involved in a discussion of intestinal germicides, the
propriety of utilizing this ‘penetrability coefficient’ in this connection is obvious,
in spite of its patent shortcomings.</p>

<p>“It is unnecessary to discuss the technique&mdash;the standard broth mentioned
in the Hygienic Bulletin, a temperature of 70&nbsp;F., a standard 4&nbsp;mm. loop and
careful attention to dilutions (using distilled water) were all observed. The
various dilutions of Trimethol Syrup were made with accurate volumetric
pipettes, measuring flasks and distilled water was used as a diluent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span></p>
<p>“The results of several determinations, using Trimethol Syrup from three
separate bottles, were in sufficient accord to warrant the statement that a
dilution of <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> of Trimethol Syrup was equivalent to a <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub></span> dilution of
carbolic acid, using <i>Bacillus typhosus</i> as the test organism. Both solutions&mdash;the
Trimethol and phenol&mdash;killed the organism in the interval between 7<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>
minutes and 10 minutes’ exposure. That is to say, our observations indicate
that under standard conditions as defined above, a 10 per cent. solution of
Trimethol Syrup is equivalent in germicidal powers, as defined by the phenol
coefficient to a 1 per cent. solution of phenol. Naturally, no predictions can
be drawn from these observations indicative of the value as an intestinal
germicide of Trimethol itself.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Penetrability coefficient</span> resulted as follows: A 5 per cent. solution
of phenol killed <i>Bacillus coli</i>, suspended uniformly throughout a cylinder of
1.2 per cent. agar in the interval between 60 and 90 minutes. A 1 per cent.
solution of phenol killed the same organisms under the same conditions in the
interval between two and one half and three hours. An undiluted solution of
Trimethol Syrup killed the organisms in the interval between two and one half
and three hours. A 10 per cent. solution (nine volumes of distilled water to
one volume of Trimethol Syrup) failed to kill the organisms in four hours. It
would appear that undiluted Trimethol Syrup has the same combined penetrability
and germicidal value as a 1 per cent. phenol solution.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Phenol coefficient</span>: A 10 per cent. solution of Trimethol Syrup in
distilled water (nine volumes of distilled water to one volume of Trimethol
Syrup) possesses the same germicidal power as a 1 per cent. solution of
carbolic acid. This coefficient takes no cognizance of the <i>actual amount of
Trimethol as such</i>&mdash;it merely indicates the relative germicidal power of the
Trimethol Syrup as sold.”</p>

<p>The preceding report shows that Trimethol Syrup has a phenol coefficient
of <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span>, and, assuming Trimethol Syrup contains the amount of Trimethol
declared, the substance Trimethol would have a phenol coefficient of 8<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span>
instead of 40, as is claimed. According to Kendall and Edwards’ method,
the penetrability-germicidal value of the syrup is equal to a 1 per cent. solution
of phenol.</p>


<h5>WALKER’S REPLY TO CRITICISM</h5>

<p>The report of the bacteriologist was submitted to The Walker-Leeming
Laboratories for comment. The following reply was received from J.&nbsp;T.
Ainslie Walker:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>May 22, 1917</i>) “In reply to your letter of the 15th inst., which has just been placed
before me on my return to town, I have to inform you that the potent constituent of
Trimethol Tablets and Trimethol Syrup is not fully available as a bactericide until it
comes in contact with the pancreatic fluid.</p>

<p>“As you will see from the enclosed extracts from clinical reports, the therapeutic
value of Trimethol has been well established.</p>

<p>“As regards penetrability, no claim has ever been made for Trimethol in this connection;
and, as I pointed out in my original paper (<i>American Medicine</i>, September, 1914), when
referring to the independent tests made by Dr. Frederick Sondern, ‘No attempt was made
to determine the bacterial content of the solid particles, as in the opinion of the writer
sterilization of the interior of these particles is not only absolutely impossible, but wholly
unnecessary. The fact of the fluid contents of the canal being sterile may be taken to
indicate that the exterior of all solid particles is in a like condition, and therefore harmless.
It is the organisms in the fluid portions only that produce the deadly effects through the
chemical substances they secrete; those in the interior of the solid portions (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, as
evacuated) may be disregarded, as they are not available for good or evil.’</p>

<p>“I must confess to no little surprise on learning that your investigator is still using
the Hygienic Laboratory method of determining phenol coefficients. I would respectfully
suggest that you call his attention to the critical comparison of the Hygienic Laboratory and
R.-W. Tests, which he will find in the enclosed reprint from the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>
of March 11, 1916: ‘Instead of being an improvement upon the standard R.-W. Test,
the so-called Hygienic Laboratory Method is so defective as to be wholly unreliable, and
incapable of furnishing results of any scientific or practical value whatever.’&#8239;”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span></p>
<p>As to the statement that the potent constituent of Trimethol Tablets and
Trimethol Syrup is not fully available as a bactericide until it comes in contact
with the pancreatic fluid, attention is called to a leaflet, which accompanies
each bottle of Trimethol Syrup, that reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Trimethol is insoluble in water, but when properly emulsified has a Rideal-Walker
co-efficient of 40; that is to say, it is 40 times more efficient as a germicide than phenol
(pure carbolic acid).”</p></div>

<p>The Trimethol Syrup which was used in the investigation, when mixed with
water produced an almost perfectly transparent solution, which justifies the
assumption that the proper physical conditions were observed and that this
objection is not well founded.</p>

<p>As regards the relation of pancreatic fluid to bactericidal availability of
Trimethol, there is little to say, other than that the published statements in
the advertising accompanying the packages make no mention of this point.
It would be interesting to know what, if any, relation the pancreatic fluid has to
this substance, in view of the statement that it “has a Rideal-Walker coefficient
of 40.”</p>

<p>The Trimethol “literature” does not throw light on the question, What is
the germicidal value of Trimethol Syrup as compared with phenol? The only
available method of determining the germicidal value of a liquid disinfectant
is to make a direct comparison of the substance in question with phenol under
similar conditions. Given parallel conditions, not obviously prejudicial to the
substance tested in contrast to the standard solution, the results are comparable,
and furnish a basis for estimating the relative germicidal power of the two
substances. In the investigation, Trimethol Syrup and phenol were thus
compared.</p>

<p>As regards the contention that the bacteria within fecal masses are harmless,
this may be granted. But it must also be admitted that these intestinal
masses are constantly being reformed so that buried micro-organisms do not
remain in the interior. For this reason, the determination of the penetrability
coefficient of a germicide is pertinent.</p>

<p>Regarding the respective merits of the old Rideal-Walker and the newer U.&nbsp;S.
Hygienic Laboratory method of determining the phenol coefficient, the Rideal-Walker
method was found to possess certain drawbacks, and in an attempt to
overcome these the “<i>Lancet</i> Method” was evolved; this method in turn was
improved in the U.&nbsp;S. Hygienic Laboratory and led to the United States Public
Health Service Hygienic Laboratory method for the determination of the phenol
coefficient of disinfectants (published in <i>Hygienic Laboratory Bulletin 82</i>). In
1913 this method was formally adopted by the Council for the valuation of disinfectants
or germicides of the phenol type, and the method is now in general
use for this purpose in the United States<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_119_125" id="FNanchor_119_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_125" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> In this connection Hiss and Zinsser
may be quoted (Ed.&nbsp;2, page 80): “The most precise method of standardizing
disinfectants is that now in use in the United States Public Health Service.”
Stitt, director of the United States Naval Medical Schools, in his Practical Bacteriology,
Blood Work and Parasitology (Ed.&nbsp;4, page 473) says: “In the
United States disinfectants are rated according to the Hygienic Laboratory
Phenol Coefficient.”</p>

<p>The Council adopted the recommendation of the Committee on Pharmacology
to the effect that the claims made for Trimethol are unsupported by acceptable
<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>evidence. Accordingly, Trimethol and the pharmaceutical preparations said
to contain it&mdash;Trimethol Syrup, Trimethol Capsules, and Trimethol Tablets&mdash;were
held ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 11, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>FERRIVINE, INTRAMINE AND COLLOSOL IODINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>E. Fougera &amp; Co., Inc., New York, acting as agent for The British Drug
Houses, Ltd., London, advertise “Ferrivine,” “Intramine” and “Collosol Iodine”
to the medical profession. A circular entitled “Ferrivine, The New Anti-Syphilitic
Remedy” begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“FERRIVINE is the name given to ferric tri-para-amino-benzene sulphonate. This iron
compound was first prepared by Mr. J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R. McDonagh, F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S., by whom it has
been both biologically and clinically tested. It is slightly soluble in water, the solution
having an acid reaction.</p>

<p  class="tac fs75">“INDICATIONS</p>

<p>“According to Mr. J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R. McDonagh’s researches, the phases of the <i>Leucocytozoon
syphilids</i> are killed by the lipoid-globulin molecules of the serum, which possess a stereochemical
molecular configuration homologous to those of the lipoid-globulin molecules of
the parasite. The process is one of absorption, a chemico-physical reaction which is in part
dependent upon the supply of active oxygen. Active oxygen is formed directly by oxidation
processes and the peroxide necessary for its formation directly by reducing processes.
Oxidation is increased by metals and reduction by non-metals. The non-metal which acts
in the body as the normal reducing agent is sulphur, hence the discovery of Intramine
(see separate pamphlet). The metal which acts in the body as the normal oxidising agent,
is iron, hence the discovery of Ferrivine.”</p></div>

<p>A circular, “Intramine, a New Non-Toxic Compound for the Treatment of
Protozoal and Chronic Bacterial Diseases,” expounds Mr. McDonagh’s ideas
of the treatment of syphilis with Ferrivine and Intramine by means of the
oxidising action of Ferrivine and the reducing action of Intramine and asserts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the ultimate administration of oxidising and reducing agents will benefit almost
any infection, it may be said that Intramine is indicated in all protozoal diseases, and in
all chronic bacterial diseases, especially in tuberculosis, presumably in leprosy and possibly
in malignant disease [cancer?]. To the administration of Intramine there are no contraindications.”</p></div>

<p>We are also told that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Intramine is useful injected into the urethra<span class="ell">...</span>. In cases of chronic urethritis
and perifolliculitis <span class="ell">..</span>. invaluable as a local application to chronic ulcers&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The Intramine circular includes a “Scheme of Treatment for Syphilis”
which advises, in addition to Intramine, Ferrivine or salvarsan, mercury and
iodids, the use of another proprietary called “Collosol Iodine.” An inquiry
addressed to Fougera &amp; Co. in regard to the character and composition of this
preparation, brought the reply that the firm had no knowledge of its identity.</p>

<p>This “scheme of treatment” is objectionable in that it advises the “stock”
treatment of a disease which demands individualization and further in that
whatever beneficial effects may result from the use of mercury and iodid is
likely to be ascribed to the preparations “Intramine,” “Ferrivine” and “Collosol
Iodine.”</p>

<p>The advertising for Ferrivine and Intramine sent out by Fougera &amp; Co.
contains no experimental or clinical data on which an estimate of their value
may be based. Apparently in England, where these products were originated,
little has been published regarding them.</p>

<p>There is, however, one report which may be accepted as a carefully controlled
clinical trial. In the <i>Lancet</i> (June 17, 1916, p.&nbsp;1214) L.&nbsp;W. Harrison, D.S.O.,
<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>M.B., Ch.B.Glasg., and C.&nbsp;H. Mills, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.Lond., report on “The
Effect of Ferrivine and Intramine on Syphilis.” After briefly reviewing the
theories which form the basis of McDonagh’s proposed treatment of syphilis
with his discoveries “Ferrivine” and “Intramine” the authors point out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. that Mr. McDonagh’s biological discoveries <span class="ell">..</span>. have not been publicly
confirmed by any biologist of standing&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>While:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. eminent chemists have confessed themselves unable to understand his chemistry.”</p></div>

<p>The authors explain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Recognizing that this might prejudice our practical tests of Intramine and Ferrivine,
we have taken particular care to guard against their influence, cross-checking our observations
and submitting them to others for confirmation or otherwise.”</p></div>

<p>Harrison and Mills chose for a test three ordinary cases of secondary syphilis,
cases with well marked lesions, the clinical progress of which could easily
be watched and from which it was easy to obtain specimens for microscopic
examination. After a detailed account of the three cases&mdash;which records
grave conditions resulting from the treatment and which shows the inefficiency
of the drugs&mdash;they write:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the above account it will be seen that the local and general reactions which
follow the injection of these preparations are by no means pleasant. In the case of
Intramine the pain is undiluted torture and lasts so for two or three days. One of us
had previously treated four cases with Intramine and the same local reaction occurred in
these. In two of them abscesses have burst outwardly, one of which is still discharging
necrotic débris, ten weeks after the injection, and will take many more weeks to close. In
those cases where no abscess has yet burst it is easy to feel by the gap in the muscles
that considerable necrosis has occurred. None of these effects can be ascribed to sepsis,
as most rigid aseptic precautions were taken. Further, particular care was taken to make
the injections strictly intramuscular. The constitutional symptoms which follow immediately
upon the injection of Ferrivine are distinctly alarming, and such as would cause one to
hesitate before injecting this remedy into any but robust patients.”</p></div>

<p>Harrison and Mills estimate the therapeutic effects of these drugs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. That Ferrivine entirely failed to cause <i>S. pallida</i> to disappear from the lesions of
three well-marked cases of secondary syphilis.</p>

<p>“2. After the failure of Ferrivine to cause the disappearance of <i>Spirochaeta pallida</i>
from a mucous patch a single dose of 0.3&nbsp;gm. salvarsan effected this in 18 hours, and
the patch, which had hitherto been uninfluenced, had healed within 48 hours.</p>

<p>“3. Clinically we were unable to detect any influence of either or both these compounds
on syphilitic lesions, although each of them was of the variety which heals in a
week or ten days under salvarsan treatment.</p>

<p>“4. Further syphilitic lesions appeared immediately after the treatment in one of the
two cases treated with both Ferrivine and Intramine. A mucous patch appeared on one
tonsil as well as further syphilitic papules from which spirochetes were obtained. The other
case developed nephritis, with albumin and epithelial casts; which was not present prior
to the injections.”</p></div>

<p>While from these cases the obvious conclusion was drawn that Intramine
and Ferrivine “have no specific effect on early syphilis,” these authors subsequently
treated a case of tertiary syphilis with the drugs. An Intramine
injection caused pain for several days but did not stop the progress of the
disease. Ferrivine was then administered “not without a feeling of grave
responsibility” in view of their previous experiences. They state that “the
reaction which resulted in this instance was the most severe” they ever experienced
after an intravenous injection of any of the anti­syphilitic remedies with
which they had previously worked. It is stated that “for a period of some
<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>minutes there was grave doubt as to the patient’s survival.” After resuscitation
the patient passed a disturbed night, and rigors which ensued lasted until
the following afternoon. The author’s report that in this case also no clinical
improvement occurred and that the Intramine-Ferrivine treatment was replaced
by a course consisting of salvarsan, potassium iodid and mercurial inunction.</p>

<p>Ferrivine, Intramine and Collosol Iodine were declared inadmissible to
New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 8, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>ESKAY’S NEURO PHOSPHATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>For the information of the profession the Council has prepared and authorized
for publication the following report on Eskay’s Neuro Phosphates.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Eskay’s Neuro Phosphates (Smith, Kline &amp; French Co., Philadelphia) is
offered to physicians under the claims that it contains alcohol, 17 per cent., and
sodium glycero­phosphate, 2 grains, calcium glycero­phosphate, 2 grains, and
strychnin glycero­phosphate, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> grain, in each dessertspoonful. It is called
a “Nerve Tissue Reconstructive,” and its advertising claims are based on the
discredited theories that certain disorders are due to a deficiency of phosphorus
in the nerve structure of the body, and that glycero­phosphates are assimilated
more readily than ordinary phosphates. This assumption was based on the
knowledge that the lecithins, which form a part of the nerve structure, contained
the glycero­phosphate radical in the molecule. In line with this, Smith, Kline
&amp; French Co. aver:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Eskay’s Neuro Phosphates is of marked value in many acute and chronic conditions,
in nervous exhaustion following mental and physical strain, neurasthenia, paralysis, anemia,
tuberculosis, marasmus, debility and wasting diseases generally, and the nerve-weakness
of the aged. It is particularly useful in convalescence from acute diseases and in the nervous
condition following la grippe.”</p></div>

<p>In its report on “The Therapeutic Value of the Glycero­phosphates” (<span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, Sept. 30, 1916, p.&nbsp;1033) the Council pointed out that the therapeutic
use of the glycero­phosphates was based on the assumption that the inorganic
phosphates cannot supply the body’s needs of phosphorus or that the use of
organic compounds “spared” the system the necessity of making such synthesis.
The report presented evidence to show that the glycero­phosphates are not
absorbed as such, but that they are split into inorganic phosphates before
absorption. The Council showed that there was convincing evidence that the
animal organism synthesizes its complex organic phosphorus constituents from
inorganic phosphates, and that organic phosphorus is of no more value as a
food than inorganic. Despite this the Neuro Phosphates advertising makes
use of the fallacious assumption regarding the action of the glycero­phosphates.</p>

<p>Pleading for the particular mixture represented by the proprietary, it is
asserted that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sodium glycero­phosphate is of special value in neurasthenia, Addison’s disease, phosphaturia
and phthisis.”</p></div>

<p>and that calcium glycero­phosphate “is employed in bone fracture, rachitis,
tuberculosis and various wasting diseases.”</p>

<p>The phosphorus content of <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> grain of strychnin glycero­phosphate is ridiculously
small. Yet it is asserted that this strychnin salt is of superior value
because it combines the effects of strychnin with a “food-like form of phosphorus.”
<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>Eskay’s Neuro Phosphates has an acid reaction which is capitalized,
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Experiments have shown that the acid glycero­phosphates are more rapidly absorbed
and are more efficient than the neutral salts.”</p></div>

<p>And as a further illustration of extravagant claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As a glycerophosphoric acid in the form of lecithin is normally present in spermatozoids,
it is but natural that the glycero­phosphates should exhibit aphrodisiac effects (as has been
observed), but this result does not seem to obtain in all cases.”</p></div>

<p>Is this a clumsy attempt to exploit this “nerve phosphate” as a “lost manhood”
cure?</p>

<p>The Council held Eskay’s Neuro Phosphates ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies because unwarranted therapeutic claims are made for it and
because the administration of strychnin, calcium, phosphate and alcohol is not
conducive to rational therapeutics, particularly when such a mixture is marketed
under a name which indicates but one of its constituents.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 29, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>K-Y LUBRICATING JELLY</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Because of inquiries received, the Council has authorized publication of the
following report declaring K-Y Lubricating Jelly inadmissible to New and
Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>K-Y Lubricating Jelly (Van Horn and Sawtell, New York), originally
advertised as a lubricant for instruments and the hands, is now also recommended
as a therapeutic agent. If the claims for “K-Y” were limited strictly
to such effects as result from the purely mechanical properties of a lubricant,
it might be held that it would not come under the purview of the Council.
The preparation, however, while introduced as a lubricant, is now offered for
a broader field of use, and the manufacturers make claims which are not
supported by any evidence available to the Council. Evidence the following,
taken from a circular that accompanies the package:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“K-Y allays smarting and burning at once through its pronounced soothing and cooling
effects, and thus makes an admirable dressing for burns.”</p>

<p>“Many physicians make a practice of anointing the bodies of their measle and scarlet
fever patients with ‘K-Y,’ in this way affording gratifying relief from itching and irritation,
and effectively preventing dissemination of infectious material.”</p></div>

<p>And this from another circular:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had one of the most troublesome cases of pruritus vulvæ that I had ever seen.
I guess I must have tried everything and the case had been referred to me by another
man, who had previously tried everything, including cauterization. Well, one day I was
examining her, and of course K-Y on the speculum&mdash;the irritation seemed to quiet down,
and the following day she said she felt no effects from it at all. Then later on, it returned,
and I couldn’t imagine what had done so much good, unless it could have been the lubricant,
so I told her to buy a tube, which she did. Every once in a while she has a return of it
slightly, but she just applies K-Y and clears it all up.”</p></div>

<p>The manufacturers state that they do not know why K-Y is so soothing, but
suggest:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Possibly the cooling action of the combination, and the effect of the 4% boric acid
contained, are factors that enter. Be all that as it may, the fact certainly remains that
oftentimes, after other local measures fail, ‘K-Y’ lubricating Jelly gives relief.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span></p>
<p>Elsewhere it is claimed to be germicidal, and to give relief in other
conditions, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Diabetic and uremic irritations, not only of the genitalia, but of other parts, have
been found fully as amenable as pruritus vulvae to the soothing influence of ‘K-Y’ Lubricating
Jelly, especially if the previous application is removed with water every time a new one
is put on.”</p></div>

<p>The foregoing citations are obviously intended largely for the public, and
make it plain that “K-Y” Jelly is not in the class of nonmedical and harmless
external applications; on the contrary, these claims tend to create the impression
that the spread of measles and scarlet fever can be <i>prevented</i> in the stage
of desquamation. To place such statements in the hands of the patient supported
by the tacit endorsement of a prescription is to create a false and
dangerous sense of security and to lead to a failure to observe other and more
important means of preventing dissemination of these diseases.</p>

<p>The Council held K-Y Lubricating Jelly in conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6 and
10, and authorized publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
Sept. 29, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>ZIRATOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Ziratol (Bristol-Myers Company, New York), in compliance with the
federal “insecticide law,” is declared to contain 32 per cent. water and 30 per
cent. glycerin as inert constituents. Regarding its active constituents the
manufacturer makes the following and meaningless statement:</p>

<p>“Ziratol is prepared from Phenols of the Naphthalene series and consists
of a solution of such Phenols in a mixture of soap, water and glycerin.”</p>

<p>In response to inquiry, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory examined Ziratol
and reported that its essential constituent appears to be alpha-napthol<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_120_126" id="FNanchor_120_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_126" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> and
that it has, essentially, the following composition by weight: Alpha-napthol
18 per cent., soap 20 per cent., glycerin and water sufficient to make 100 per
cent.</p>

<p>A Ziratol advertising circular gives a tabulated report of germicidal tests,
said to have been made according to the method of the Hygienic Laboratory
of the U.&nbsp;S. Public Health Service. When this work was done is not stated.
According to these tests Ziratol possesses a phenol-coefficient of 13.66. The
claim that Ziratol is ten times more efficient than carbolic acid (phenol) is
evidently based on this report.</p>

<p>These claims of high germicidal value are contradicted by an examination
made for the Council. A specimen purchased in the open market was examined
independently by two operators, to determine the Hygienic Laboratory phenol-coefficient.
One observer found the phenol coefficient to be 2.54. The other
reported it to be 3.09. Evidently the germicidal value of Ziratol is greatly
exaggerated in the advertising claims and, in fact, does not exceed that of the
official compound solution of cresol (Liquor Cresolis Compositus, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.)
for which a phenol-coefficient of about three has been established. (See New
and Non­official Remedies, 1917, p.&nbsp;82.) The claim that Ziratol is “the Universal
Antiseptic and Germicide” is manifestly an unwarranted exaggeration.</p>

<p>The referee in submitting this report to the Council recommended that
Ziratol be held in conflict with Rule 1 (secrecy of composition) and Rule 6
(unwarranted and exaggerated claims). After the report had been submitted,
it was found that a new advertising circular, accompanying a trade package,
no longer contained the claim that “Ziratol is ten times more efficient than
Carbolic Acid.” The older circular made the following statement:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Strong Activity.&mdash;Compared with the bactericidal action of Carbolic Acid by the method
of the Hygienic Laboratory of the Marine Hospital Service, <span class="smcap">Ziratol</span> has the Carbolic Acid
Coefficient of more than <span class="lowercase smcap">TEN</span>, that is, <span class="smcap">Ziratol</span> is <span class="lowercase smcap">TEN</span> times more efficient than Carbolic
Acid,&mdash;a strength unapproached by any other of its class. <span class="smcap">Ziratol</span> in dilution of 1:1400
kills the Typhoid Bacillus in 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> minutes, thus proving that it is strongly active even in very
weak solutions.”</p></div>

<p>The new advertising circular reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Strong Activity&mdash;Extensive bacteriological investigations on many pathogenic organisms,
conducted in the Lederle Laboratories of New York, prove conclusively the high
bactericidal value of Ziratol in extremely dilute solutions. (A copy of the complete report
will be mailed upon request.)”</p></div>

<p>In response to a request, the Bristol-Myers Company sent a copy of the
bacteriologic investigations of Ziratol, said to have been made by the Lederle
Laboratories. The organisms employed for these tests were <i>Staphylo­coccus
aureus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus albus</i>, <i>Strepto­coccus</i>, Green pus bacillus, <i>B. coli</i>, and
saliva. No tests are given with the typhoid bacillus. The conclusion is
reached that “in all the tests the solutions of Ziratol have several times greater
killing efficiency than those of phenol.” The “coefficients” or comparative values
which can be calculated from the results after exposure of 15 minutes to the
disinfectants range from 2.0 to 4.0. This is in substantial accord with the
referee’s findings as regards the phenol-coefficient with <i>B. typhosus</i> as the test
object. While the new advertising circular avoids the former claim that Ziratol
is ten times more efficient than carbolic acid, in germicidal value, it still
makes the unwarranted claims that Ziratol is the “universal disinfectant.”</p>

<p>The Council declared Ziratol inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
(1) because its composition is secret (Rule 1); (2) because the phenol coefficient,
determined according to the method of the Hygienic Laboratory, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S.,
is not stated on the label (Rule 2); (3) because the label and the
circular accompanying the trade package advises its use by the public as a
“vaginal douche” (Rule 3); and (4) because the claim that Ziratol is the
“universal disinfectant” is exaggerated and unwarranted (Rule 6).</p>

<p>Before authorizing publication of the preceding report the Council submitted
it to the Bristol-Myers Company in order to give that company the opportunity
of revising its method of marketing Ziratol. In reply the company
enlarged on its withdrawal (on “our own initiative”) of the claim that Ziratol
had a phenol-coefficient of over ten when this claim was shown to be incorrect
“by authoritative sources.” One wonders whether this is a euphemistic reference
to the proceedings of the federal authorities under the Insecticide Act against
the Bristol-Myers Company, just made public<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_121_127" id="FNanchor_121_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_127" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> because of the false claims
made for the germicidal efficiency of Ziratol. This prosecution resulted in the
seizure and condemnation of two lots of this proprietary which had passed in
interstate commerce.</p>

<p>The Bristol-Myers Company in replying to the Council’s report made no
offer to declare the exact composition of Ziratol, to state the actual phenol-coefficient,
or to remove the other objections pointed out in the report of the
Council. In other words, the Bristol-Myers Company has abandoned a definite
but false claim of high germicidal power&mdash;a claim which subjected the firm to
federal prosecution&mdash;and has substituted therefor indefinite statements which
do not define the actual germicidal efficiency of Ziratol.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 6, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>GONOSAN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report on Gonosan and authorized
its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Gonosan (Riedel and Company, Inc., New York City) comes in the form
of capsules, each said to contain 5 minims of a mixture composed of oil of
sandalwood 80 per cent., and 20 per cent. of alpha- and beta-resin of kava,
isolated by a patent process. The mixture, as the name implies, is intended
for the treatment of gonorrhea.</p>

<p>This proprietary preparation was under consideration by the Council at
various times from 1905 to 1910. During this time, the Council agreed to
accept the preparation if the suggestive name was changed, the therapeutic
exaggerations abandoned, and the drug kava admitted to New and Non­official
Remedies. The name was not changed, the other questions were left open, and
the preparation was not accepted.</p>

<p>Recent and more objectionable advertising of Gonosan makes it advisable
for the Council to take action and to publish a report. The tone of this advertising
is reflected by the following quotation from a recent advertising circular:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The old-established balsamic treatment of gonorrhea, for some years neglected in favor
of the local injection of organic silver and other germicidal salts, has, with the increasing
knowledge and attention paid to the composition and purity of the balsams, regained to a
large extent the confidence formerly reposed in them.</p>

<p>“It may now be said that the combined treatment with local injections and internal
administration of natural balsamic products completely dominates modern gonorrheal therapy.”</p></div>

<p>Any one conversant with current medical literature and practice would
stamp these statements as misleading exaggerations. The balsams, oleoresins
and volatile oils may have some value as minor adjuvants in the treatment of
gonorrhea, but that is all. The position in this respect has not changed
materially in recent years. These agents do not have a value equal to that of
local treatment, as the quoted statement implies.</p>

<p>The claims made for Gonosan might with equal force be made for oil of
santal alone. Kava kava, the other constituent, belongs to the pepper family;
it had a temporary vogue some two or three decades ago, but has failed to
maintain a place. It has never been recognized officially. There is no scientific
evidence that it has any value either alone or as an adjuvant to sandal oil.
The “clinical reports” quoted in the advertising circulars, rather curiously,
nearly all date back ten years or more, viz., to a period when the attitude of
the profession toward proprietary remedies was less critical than it is now. It
would be interesting to know whether these authors still adhere to their
opinion, or whether any of them have subsequently had experiences similar to
that of a correspondent who wrote:</p>

<p>“Gonosan, at my hands, did not prove to be of more essential value in the
treatment of gonorrhea than any other sandalwood oil preparation. The
various claims made for Gonosan, that it possesses sedative and anesthetic
properties, that by its continuous use the urethral discharge disappears more
rapidly and that, if combined with appropriate diet and rest, it is liable to
prevent complications, are, according to my experience, not corroborated by
actual results.”</p>

<p>The only experimental work quoted in support of Gonosan, that of Pohl, is
not convincing. The doses that Pohl found necessary to influence experimental
purulent pleurisy makes it impossible to transfer his work to the clinic. (He
found a dosage of oil of santal corresponding to an ounce per day, for man,
inefficient; positive results were obtained only with 2 ounces per day.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>
<p>In order to learn the estimate placed on the therapeutic value of the “balsams,”
an inquiry was sent to the authors of the papers presented to the section
of Genito-Urinary Diseases at the recent meeting of the American Medical
Association in New York. The inquiry read:</p>

<p>“<i>Dear Doctor</i>:&mdash;An advertising circular for Gonosan ‘Riedel’ which is now
being distributed begins thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The old-established balsamic treatment of gonorrhea, for some years neglected
in favor of the local injection of organic silver and other germicidal
salts, has, with the increasing knowledge and attention paid to the composition
and purity of the balsams, regained to a large extent the confidence
formerly reposed in them.’</p>

<p>‘It may now be said that the combined treatment with local injections and
internal administration of natural balsamic products completely dominates
modern gonorrheal therapy.’</p></div>

<p>“Is the statement correct that the combined treatment with local injections
and internal administration of natural balsamic products completely dominates
modern gonorrheal therapy? Your reply to the above will be appreciated by
the Council.”</p>

<p>Seventeen replies were received. They bear out the position that has been
outlined. Only one writer considered the statement even approximately justified,
and this in the sense that “the majority of cases receive no other treatment”
than a combination of local applications and systemic medication. Another
stated that, “in a general way their statement is true though a trifle too sweeping,”
and then added that the field of the balsams is rather restricted. With
the exception of these qualified endorsements the remaining (fifteen) replies
characterized the statement as incorrect and misleading. The replies are a
valuable contribution to the status of the “balsam” treatment of gonorrhea, and
extracts of them are appended to this report.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the Council declare Gonosan inadmissible to New
and Non­official Remedies, because the therapeutic claims are exaggerated (Rule
6); because there is no evidence that the combination of kava resin with oil of
santal is superior to oil of santal alone (Rule 10); and because the thera­peutically
suggestive name is conducive of indiscriminate and unwarranted
use of the preparation both by the profession and the public (Rules 4 and 8).</p>

<p>The extracts from replies received to the inquiry above referred to, follow:</p>

<p>Dr. B., Penn., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my practice I have found that local injections are very valuable in the treatment

<p>Dr. F., D. C., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While it is doubtless true that acute urethritis, gonorrheal, is now generally treated
by local injections of solutions of organic silver salts, and that santal oil is often used,
it is not true, as one would infer from the quotation, that the balsams are now considered
more efficacious than they were formerly. So far as I know they have not lost or regained
anything during the past dozen years in the way of confidence reposed in them. The indications
for their use is very definite and very limited.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. B., Ga., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. In recent years I have almost abandoned the use of balsams, etc., in the

It is important for patients to drink freely of water and when so doing the balsams
<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>are so diluted that I cannot conceive of their doing much good. Formerly my patients
often lost weight during the treatment of gonorrhea; now, without balsams and with plenty
of water, they usually gain in weight.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. S., Mich., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. we believe that in a general way their statement is true though a trifle too

of all cases of acute gonorrhea at some time during the course of the disease.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. L., Mo., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I would say that the statement that, ‘The combined treatment with local injections and

an indirect soothing effect on the mucous membranes involved, the dominant factor is local
treatment, aiming at disinfection and restoration to normal of the inflamed tissues.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. R., Mich., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Regarding your request although I am willing to reply it is difficult to do so because
if I should do so in the affirmative that could apply only to certain acute cases without

on antiseptics in acute urethritis when there are no objections to such treatment&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. K., Ill., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am under the impression that the internal administration of balsamics is used only
when complications arise, such as acute posterior urethritis. Personally I use the balsamics
very, very rarely. From my observation, however, I am led to believe that many men still
use internal drugs in the treatment of gonorrhea, and during the past few years, I should
say the use of hexa­methylen­amin has been on the increase, and the use of the balsams
on the decrease. I do not believe that hexa­methylen­amin is of any value in the treatment
of gonorrhea, and am simply citing this as my observation of the widespread use of this
drug in the treatment of gonorrhea.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T., Penn., wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Sandal wood oil during the acute stage of gonorrhea certainly tends to make the

action. That it plays any <i>considerable</i> part in actual cure I think is doubtful. The statement
as quoted is true in so far as it states that local treatment plus internal medication
with a balsam comprises most of the modern treatment of gonorrhea but it is grossly misleading
in that it lets one draw the inference that the balsam plays a large if not the
principal part.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. H., New York, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“For a period of at least three years in my hospital, dispensary and private practice,
I conscientiously tried out most of the balsamics on the market (including Gonosan, which
I favored for some time) both alone, and combined with local injections. As a result of
this study, I have come to the conclusion that the balsamics have little, if any value in the
treatment of gonorrhea. During the past few years I have relied almost entirely on local
therapy, and seldom prescribed any of the balsams in my private practice, certainly in not
more than 5 per cent. of the cases. My results I find are just as satisfactory, and my
<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>patients appreciate the fact that they are not loaded up with disagreeable medication. Instead
of the balsamics, I am using sodium bicarbonate more and more, and feel convinced that the
proper use of this drug is of more value than all of them combined.”</p>

<h3>ALCRESTA IPECAC</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>In 1915 Alcresta Ipecac Tablets (Eli Lilly and Co.) were admitted to New
and Non­official Remedies as a preparation of ipecac that is insoluble in the
stomach but soluble in the intestines. It was supposed that this property would
permit the administration of ipecac without the accompanying nausea and
vomiting, and that this would be of especial advantage when using the drug in
amebic dysentery. The systemic effects, of course, would be those of ipecac.</p>

<p>More recently, the manufacturers of Alcresta Ipecac have been advising
its use in conditions which were not contemplated by the Council when the
preparation was accepted for New and Non­official Remedies. They now claim
that ipecac alkaloids have been shown to be useful in the treatment of typhoid
fever, flatulence, diarrhea and constipation and that Alcresta Ipecac has these
properties. Such a statement is misleading. While it is true that at one
time ipecac was used promiscuously against “flatulence, diarrhea and constipation”
there never has been and is not now any scientific evidence of its efficiency
in such conditions except, of course, in diarrhea of the amebic type. As to
the alleged usefulness of ipecac in typhoid fever: This has not even the sanction
of tradition and the claim certainly should not be accepted until there is strong
evidence to support it.</p>

<p>The advertising matter on Alcresta Ipecac also contained statements to the
effect that ipecac alkaloids have a demonstrated usefulness in pyorrhea. Such
an unequivocal statement is unwarranted. In spite of the enthusiastic advocacy,
in the past, of ipecac alkaloids as a specific in pyorrhea alveolaris the preponderance
of scientific evidence indicates that ipecac is of questionable value
in this condition. Neither is there any substantial evidence to warrant the
claim that ipecac alkaloids, when absorbed through the intestines, are demonstrably
useful in amebic infections of the tonsils.</p>

<p>The reputation of the best drugs, whether unofficial or official, is bound to
suffer if extravagant claims for them are permitted to go unchallenged. The
referee of the Council, therefore, believed it necessary to call the attention of
the manufacturers of Alcresta Ipecac Tablets to the statements made for the
product and suggested that they submit evidence to substantiate the claims.
This the manufacturers have refused to do. Their attitude in the matter, as
well as their attitude toward the Council’s work is expressed in the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Responding to your letter of March 10th, we beg to suggest that literature covering the
different matters at issue are readily available to your referee, and all statements emanating
from us are made advisedly.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
<p>“If you cannot satisfy yourselves that this preparation is a scientific product, ethically
advertised, and a desirable advance in therapeutics, you can only delete it from your next
issue of New and Non­official Remedies.”</p></div>

<p>It is to be regretted that Eli Lilly and Co. refuse either to withdraw or
modify their claims or to substantiate these claims by scientific evidence. The
statements as they stand are exaggerated, misleading and harmful. As such
they conflict with Rule 6 of the Council and necessitate the omission of Alcresta
Ipecac from New and Non­official Remedies. The referee recommended the
adoption and publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct.

<h3>IODEOL AND IODAGOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Iodeol and Iodagol (formerly called Iodargol) are products of Viel and
Company, Rennes, France, widely advertised in this country by David B. Levy,
Incorporated, New York. The claim made for both preparations is that they
depend on “colloidal iodin” for their action. They are put up in a number of
forms, for instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Iodeol Ampoules each containing 1&nbsp;c.c. (20 centigrammes colloidal iodin in an oily
vehicle).”</p>

<p>“Iodeol External, containing 50 per cent. colloidal iodine.”</p>

<p>“Iodagol Ampoules, each containing 2&nbsp;c.c. (50 centigrammes colloidal iodine in an oily
vehicle).”</p></div>

<p>The claim is, that, the iodin being in the colloidal state, it has the properties
of elementary iodin and thus the preparations may be used in concentrations
and under conditions which would make the use of free iodin impossible. The
products have been extensively and extravagantly advertised for use in a
wide range of conditions. Thus Iodeol has been proposed in the treatment of:</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">
“Pulmonary Tuberculosis”<br />
“Laryngeal Tuberculosis,”<br />
“Glandular Tuberculosis”<br />
“Tuberculosis of the Bones”<br />
“Pneumonia, Broncho-pneumonia, and Congestive Conditions”<br />
“Whooping Cough, Influenza, Asthma”<br />
“Typhoid Fever”<br />
“Syphilis”<br />
“Obesity.”<br />
</p>

<p>Iodagol, which is for external use, has been advised in the treatment of:</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">
“Gonorrhea and its Sequelæ”<br />
“Cystitis”<br />
“Tetanus”<br />
“Wounds complicated by gaseous gangrene”<br />
“Burns”<br />
“Old Suppurations, ulcers, abscesses, etc.”<br />
“Articular rheumatism”<br />
“Abscess Alveolar”<br />
“Pyorrhea Alveolaris”<br />
“Stomatitis (Canker-Sores).”<br />
</p>

<p>Nearly two years ago the American agents requested the Council to consider
Iodeol and Iodagol for admission to New and Non­official Remedies. The
information submitted in regard to their character and composition was vague
and indefinite, the pharmacologic information practically nil and the clinical
data as voluminous as it was unconvincing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span></p>
<p>On the basis of chemical, pharmacologic, bacteriologic and clinical investigation
carried out under the direction of the referee and a study of the
submitted evidence, the referee reported:</p>

<p>1. Iodeol and Iodagol do not contain the amount of iodin claimed.</p>

<p>2. The iodin is not present as elementary iodin, but instead the preparations
behave similarly to the well-known organic iodin compounds such as iodized
fats.</p>

<p>3. The therapeutic claims made for the preparations are exaggerated and
unwarranted.</p>

<p>In view of his findings he recommended that Iodeol and Iodagol be declared
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rules 1 and 2
(misleading statements regarding composition and identification) and Rule 6
(unwarranted therapeutic claims). The Council adopted the recommendation
of the referee, directing inclusion of the full report in the annual Council
reports after submission to the manufacturer, and recommending publication
of an abstract of this report in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>.</p>

<p>This report was brought to the attention of the American agent, David B.
Levy, Inc., and through them to the French manufacturers, E. Viel and
Company. The manufacturers have intimated that they will not file a reply to
the report. The firm of David B. Levy, Inc., has decided to sever its connection
with these products and to discontinue their sale.</p>

<h4>Summary of Referee’s Report</h4>

<p>Iodeol and Iodagol were submitted to the Council nearly two years ago as
“electro-colloidal iodine” and with the claim that they produced all the antiseptic
and other effects of ordinary iodin without any of its side actions. The referee
has done much work on the subject, conducted a large amount of correspondence
and has contended with long delays. He feels that the consideration of these
products should be brought to a conclusion and accordingly he submits this
report of their consideration. The following is a summary of the report, which
is appended:</p>

<p><i>I. Discrepancy in Iodin Percentage.</i>&mdash;The examination at the Chemical Laboratory
of the American Medical Association, as well as that of the referee,
shows that the various samples of Iodeol and Iodagol examined contained a
little less than one-half of the total iodin claimed. These facts were reported
to the American agent. After a lengthy delay a reply was received which presented
a double excuse: (1) that the full amount of iodin had been added,
whatever had become of it later; (2) that the claims were made for “colloidal
iodin” and that this is not elementary iodin in the colloidal state, but a preparation
of iodin containing only 50 per cent. of real iodin. Neither explanation can be
taken seriously, as they are obvious quibblings. The referee concludes that the
preparations are falsely labeled as to iodin content.</p>

<p><i>II. Nature of the Iodin Compound in Iodeol and Iodagol.</i>&mdash;In the information
sent the Council, Iodeol and Iodagol were defined as “A suspension of
electro-chemical colloidal iodin in a vehicle of purified oil.” Numerous inquiries
have failed to elicit more specific information from the manufacturer or his
agent. The statement of composition can mean only that the preparations
contain free iodin (but in colloidal form) suspended in oil. No evidence to
substantiate this claim has been submitted. (There is evidence that the preparations
<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>contain colloidal particles, but it does not indicate if this colloidal material
is iodin, or a combination of iodin or indeed whether the colloidal component
contains any iodin.) The recent statements of the agent seem to concede that
what they call “electro-colloidal iodin” contains only about 50 per cent. of
real iodin, in other words that it is not “colloidal iodin” at all, but a mixture
or combination of iodin with some other unnamed substance. This, of course,
is something very different.</p>

<p>Certain results reported from the American Medical Association’s Chemical
Laboratory suggest that the so-called “colloidal iodin” of Iodeol may be a
combination of iodin with a volatile oil. The investigations of the referee
indicate that the iodin exists in a rather resistant form or combination behaving
altogether differently from ordinary free iodin, and rather resembling
the behavior of iodin substitution products, such as iodized fats or phenols.
Briefly then the recent admissions of the agents indicate that Iodeol does not
contain “colloidal iodin” in a chemical sense, and there are indications that it
does contain its iodin in a rather firm (chemical) combination.</p>

<p><i>III. Chemical Properties of Iodeol.</i>&mdash;From a study of different specimens
of Iodeol, the referee concludes that fresh specimens contain no free iodin
and that old ones contain small amounts as a result of decomposition.
Iodeol has the solubility characteristics of fats and fat-like compounds. The
examination, as a whole, shows that Iodeol contains a peculiar and rather
resistant form or combination of iodin. There is nothing in the chemical data
that suggests that it could act differently from ordinary iodin compounds, such
as iodized fats. It would not act as ordinary iodin.</p>

<p><i>IV. Pharmacologic Data.</i>&mdash;The pharmacologic statements which were submitted
were loose and apparently meaningless or misleading. In reply to
questions submitted by the referee, the manufacturer finally had some work
done and submitted a report by Jean Laumonnier. The referee was unable to
confirm some of this work, and as a whole it does not appear materially to
elucidate the action of Iodeol. From a consideration of the submitted evidence,
and as a result of his own work, the referee concludes that Iodeol does not
behave like elementary iodin; it does not coagulate proteins and therefore is
not irritant. It is presumably absorbed, but quite probably after chemical
change; it is changed into iodid and, like organic iodids, is excreted somewhat
more slowly than when inorganic iodids are administered, but the difference
does not appear important.</p>

<p><i>V. Antiseptic and Bactericidal Action.</i>&mdash;Elementary iodin is considered a
fairly powerful agent in these respects. The activity is presumably due to
changes in the proteins, etc., of the bacteria, analogous to the effects which
produce pain, irritation and necrosis of the tissue cells. Since the latter effect
is not produced by Iodeol, it seems highly improbable, if not impossible, that it
should act on bacteria like elementary iodin. It is entirely unjustifiable to credit
the known antibacterial qualities of ordinary iodin to “colloid” iodin. This misrepresentation
is especially prominent in the circular “Notable New Therapeutic
Agents,” as will be seen, for instance, from the following citations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Iodine has long been universally recognized as an antiseptic of extraordinary potency.
Not only is it rapid and certain in its germ-destroying action, but it also possesses an
attribute denied many other antiseptic agents, namely, the power to penetrate and impregnate
the tissues. Other antiseptics, as is well known, act on the surface epithelium only.”</p>

<p>“According to Kinnaman (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 26, 1905), iodine is far superior to
bichloride of mercury, a two per cent. solution killing strepto­coccus pyogenes in two minutes.
Iodine does not coagulate albumin, and is very penetrating.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span></p>
<p>The citations imply that this “colloidal iodin” of Iodeol and Iodagol acts as
an antiseptic like ordinary iodin, except that it is claimed to be more efficient
by “diffusing” more readily. This is entirely unjustified and misleading. If
Iodeol and Iodagol are really antiseptic, they must act by some other mechanism
than that through which elementary iodin acts, and such antiseptic action would
have to be demonstrated by direct observation and not assumed from the known
action of free iodin.</p>

<p>Antiseptic and bactericidal effects are easily estimated by laboratory methods.
Yet no evidence on this point appeared to have been available until the Council
called for this. Laumonnier then carried out some experiments which were in
turn submitted to bacteriologic control. The bacteriologist failed to obtain any
results with some of the tests, and considered the other data of little value.</p>

<p>The claim that Iodeol and Iodagol have the antiseptic and bactericidal action
of free iodin lacks proof and must be considered unwarranted and misleading
in the extreme.</p>

<p><i>VI. Clinical Trials.</i>&mdash;The manufacturers and agents of Iodeol presented
many letters from physicians; but few, if any, of these gave evidence of careful,
critical, controlled observations. They could not, therefore, be considered as
acceptable evidence. The more important claims, letters and published papers,
however, were submitted to clinical specialists collaborating with the Council,
with the request that they examine these and conduct some clinical trials, if
they considered it advisable. The results obtained in these preliminary trials
did not appear sufficient to warrant further experimentation.</p>

<p>From a consideration of the evidence presented, the referee concludes that
the claims made for Iodeol and Iodagol are unwarranted, exaggerated and misleading.
He recommends that Iodeol and Iodagol be declared ineligible for
New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rules 1 and 2 (misleading
statements as to composition and identification) and with Rule 6 (unwarranted
and misleading therapeutic claims). He further recommends that the Council
authorize publication of the preceding summary of the consideration of Iodeol
and Iodagol in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> and inclusion of the full report in the annual
Council reports after submission to the manufacturer.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal

reducing the intestinal putrefaction and fermentation, allaying the pain and
discomfort of flatulent conditions in the intestinal tract” is an unwarranted,
exaggerated and misleading claim of therapeutic value (Rule 6); because (2)
the name does not indicate the identity of the bismuth salt contained in the
capsules, nor declare the presence of betanaphthol and creosote (Rule 8); and
because (3) the combination of bismuth subgallate, resorcinol, betanaphthol and
creosote in fixed proportions is irrational (Rule 10).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council

<p>Sunshine’s Formosol (The Formosol Chemical Company, formerly the Sunshine
Chemical Company, Cleveland, Ohio) is claimed to contain 18 per cent.
formaldehyd in a solution of soap. It is therefore very similar to Veroform
Germicide which was deleted from New and Non­official Remedies because of
the low phenol coefficient reported by the Hygienic Laboratory of the United
States Public Health Service (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Nov. 22, 1913, p.&nbsp;1920.) The
Council voted that in view of the Hygienic Laboratory’s finding that formaldehyd
has a low germicidal value, the manufacturers of Formosol be required to
produce definite evidence of the degree of germicidal value for this product.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span></p>
<p>In submitting the preparation to the Council, it was claimed that Formosol
had “all properties peculiar to Formaldehyde.” This conservative tone was,
however, not maintained in the form-letters submitted. These contain the
following unwarranted statements:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the name implies, <span class="lowercase smcap">FORMOSOL</span> is a formaldehyde preparation, which embodies all the
innate antiseptic merits and eliminates all the ill features of the world’s greatest disinfectant.”</p>

<p>“The elimination of all the destructive elements and the incorporation of all the
established therapeutic virtues of formaldehyde, have been scientifically blended in <span class="lowercase smcap">FORMOSOL</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Formosol</span> is unique in the sphere of antisepsis because of its peculiar healing properties
as diametrically opposed to irritation to the tissue of mucous membrane.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Formosol</span> may be used for the thousand niceties of modern antisepsis, but is <i>specific</i>
in Gynecology and Obstetrics and is indicated in Dermatology.” [Italics not in original.]</p>

<p>“The constant use of <span class="lowercase smcap">FORMOSOL</span> is to develop a habit sympathetic to ethics.”</p>

<p>“To prescribe <span class="lowercase smcap">FORMOSOL</span> is a great step toward Personal Hygiene, a <i>duty of the medical
fraternity</i> to the laity.” [Italics not in original.]</p></div>

<p>The trade package recommends the use of Formosol “for cuts, wounds,
ulcers, abscesses&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” This is a conflict with Rule 4. The Council held
Formosol in conflict with Rules 4 and 6, and advised the manufacturers that
Formosol is refused admission to New and Non­official Remedies until they
submit evidence establishing the degree of antiseptic and germicidal efficiency,
and justify the quotations listed above; or until these and any other existing
conflicts with the Rules have been removed.</p>

<p>After submission of this report to The Formosol Chemical Company the
Council authorized its publication.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry, 1917, p.&nbsp;145.</i>)</p>

<h3>IODOLENE, A SOLUTION OF IODIN IN LIQUID
PETROLATUM, INADMISSIBLE TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council was asked to consider a solution of iodin in liquid petrolatum,
said to be prepared from Gulf Coast petroleum by a special process. It was
to be marketed as “Iodolen” provided the Council found the preparation admissible
to New and Non­official Remedies. The preparation was claimed to
contain over 1.5 per cent. free iodin. The following claims were made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is less irritating in its use on the skin, or in wounds.” “Will kill pathogenic micro-organisms
present.” “Is a suitable medium for cell proliferation.” “Will penetrate a
useful distance into the walls of a wound.” “Facilitates an easier, less painful and better
method of dressing wounds or ulcers.”</p></div>

<p>Examination in the American Medical Association Chemical Laboratory
showed a submitted sample to contain 1.32 per cent. free iodin and to emit
a strong odor of hydrogen sulphid. A specimen of liquid petrolatum, said to
be composed chiefly of hydrocarbons of the naphthene series, after saturation
with iodin at room temperature was found to contain 1.42 per cent. free iodin.
Another specimen of liquid petrolatum, said to be composed chiefly of saturated
hydrocarbons, after saturation at room temperature was found to contain 1.30
per cent. free iodin.</p>

<p>The preparation having been shown to be an unoriginal, simple solution of
iodin in liquid petrolatum, the Council declared the name “Iodolene” unacceptable
(Rule 8) and the therapeutic claims made for the preparation
unwarranted (Rule 6).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>KALAK WATER</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report, submitted by a member of the Council’s committee on
chemistry, was endorsed by the committee and adopted by the Council:</p>

<p>Kalak Water, sold by the Kalak Water Company, Inc., New York, is an
artificial mineral water said to be made by adding certain salts to carbonated,
distilled water and supersaturating with the gas under pressure. Such merit
as it may possess by virtue of sodium bicarbonate and sodium phosphate is
quite insufficient to warrant the extravagant claims made in the advertising
pamphlets.</p>

<p>According to the analysis furnished, the water contains, in 1,000,000 parts
(milligrams per liter) the following:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal vat"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium carbonate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03"><span class="ilb">4049.0</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium phosphate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">238.5</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium chloride</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">806.3</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Calcium carbonate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">578.2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Magnesium&nbsp;carbonate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">48.9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Potassium chloride</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">47.9</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Among the many misleading statements found in the advertising pamphlet
bearing the title “A Brief for Physiological Alkalescence” these may be quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The calcium content of Kalak is over 100% greater than ever before placed in solution
in any vehicle, a fact of supreme importance when the unique alkalinizing power of the
alkaline salts of this metal is considered; the ratio of calcium metabolism to its enormous
waste in pregnancy, the diseases of infancy and childhood and the rapidly growing group
of ‘acidoses’ make its availability in Kalak of double value.”</p></div>

<p>The first part of this statement is untrue; the last part is muddled and
without much meaning. Evidently the “acidosis” fad is to be overworked as
was the old “uric acid diathesis,” of unsavory memory. Again this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the most important characteristics of Kalak is the close approximation of its
formula to the correlation of the contained salts as they occur in the human body, together
with its freedom from salts foreign to the human economy. Another is its almost unbelievable
palatability, considering its high degree of alkalinity, it being eleven times greater than
any other known mineral water, artificial or natural.”</p></div>

<p>These statements are false. The salts dissolved here bear no discernible
relation to the needs of the body, as disclosed by the composition of the blood
or solid tissues or as shown by the character of the urinary excretion. The last
statement concerning the high alkalinity is neither clear nor accurate. Then,
this warning and remedy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It seems to be an unappreciated fact that the degree of urinary acidity, checked with
the acidity of the saliva, is in direct ratio to the existing acid toxemia, and a urine acid
to methyl red should be the signal for immediate and adequate alkalinizing treatment<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“Startling clinical results have been observed by physicians who have used Kalak
thoughtfully and sufficiently in the more serious types of acidosis associated with diabetes,
nephritis, rheumatism, gout and the acute infections. There is also evidence of its good
effect in acute alcoholism and the respiratory edemas; in fact a certain few have hailed
Kalak as a possible solution of the annual hay fever problem. Of perhaps supreme importance,
however, is the use of Kalak throughout pregnancy as preventive medicine against the
inevitable ‘toxemia of pregnancy.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>Also this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Kalak has accomplished certain unexplainable things for the diabetic and nephritic, and
if, in future years, diabetes and nephritis should prove to be constitutional diseases, based
upon functionation or its lack, Kalak therapy, the embodiment of physiological alkalescence
may come into its own, for if acidity retards, alkalinity must normalize functionation.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span></p>
<p>It is not necessary to quote further. In order to insure that everyone will
recognize the great need of Kalak it is advised to test the urine for acidity by
means of a group of indicator solutions sent out to the physicians. Methyl
red is one of these and any urine showing an acid reaction with this is said
to be open to suspicion. Paranitrophenol is another of the indicators and
the explanations given of the behavior of the two and the conclusions to be
drawn are questionable. The methyl red solution furnished is too concentrated
for proper use and perfectly normal urines from normal individuals have given
a rather marked color with it. This indicator gives some color at [H<sup>+</sup>] =
1.2 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and a strong reaction at 3 × 10<sup>-3</sup>. To condemn a urine on such a
finding is entirely unwarranted.</p>

<p>Sodium bicarbonate is the main constituent of the water. The value of the
phosphate in such a combination, with so much calcium, is problematical. In
case an alkaline reaction in the intestine is reached some of it would be left
as insoluble phosphate. A few grams of bicarbonate daily would have equal
therapeutic value with this water. The advice based on the indications of
methyl red and the urine is bad.</p>

<p>The committee’s report was sent to the Kalak Water Company for comment.
The company promised to withdraw the advertising circular referred to in
the report and disclaimed responsibility for the accuracy and value of the set
of indicators which it sent out, but, on the whole, the previous advertising
claims were insisted on.</p>

<p>In view of the absurd and false claims made for the product the Council
declared Kalak Water inadmissible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1917, p.&nbsp;148.</i>)</p>

<h3>MINSON’S SOLUBLE IODIN “KELPIDINE” NOT
ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Minson’s Soluble Iodin “Kelpidine” was submitted to the Council by J.&nbsp;J.
Minson, Washington, D.&nbsp;C., trading as the Kelpidine Company, with the statement
that in future “literature” it was to be known as Minson’s Soluble Iodin,
only. The following statement of composition was furnished:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Minson’s Soluble Iodin is somewhat of an indefinite character, chemically. Its formula
is, Iodin 4 per cent., Distilled Water 6 per cent., and Absolute Alcohol <i>q. s.</i> 100 per cent.
By a process of chilling and heating an iodid of uncertain character is produced, and
because of the extreme sensitiveness of the product to chemical tests, it is hard to determine.
So far as I have been able to judge, however, the result is about 3 or 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent. free
iodin and from <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent. to 1 per cent. iodid, possibly ethyl and hydrogen iodid in
combination.”</p></div>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports that the preparation is an
alcoholic solution containing free iodin and iodid, probably hydrogen iodid
and ethyl iodid, but that the free iodin content was only 2.69&nbsp;gm. per 100&nbsp;c.c.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the “therapeutic indications” of Minson’s Soluble Iodin
are the “same as those of all iodin and iodid preparations, internally, externally,
hypodermically and intravenously; excepting, however, counter irritation.” It
is admitted that there are no “clinical reports” as to the hypodermic and
intravenous use, but the belief is expressed “that in an emergency it is a safe
remedy under proper dilution.” It is further claimed that “for all practical
purposes it is nontoxic and nonirritating” and that “it has none of the undesirable
features such as is the case with the iodids and the organic preparations
of iodin, proprietary or otherwise.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span></p>
<p>It was assigned for consideration to the Committee on Pharmacology, whose
referee reported:</p>

<p>“According to the information submitted, this is a tincture of iodin; differing
from the official tincture in that it is more dilute and in that hydrogen and
ethyl iodid is the solvent in place of potassium iodid. It is practically immaterial
for internal administration, whether the cation of the solvent iodid is
hydrogen, ethyl, potassium or sodium. It would certainly be inadvisable to
inject a preparation containing free iodin hypodermically. It is not ‘a safe
remedy’ for intravenous injection and it would not be nonirritant. The statement
that ‘it has none of the undesirable features’ of other iodin compounds is
inherently impossible. Apparent freedom of any iodin preparation from
undesirable effects is generally due to the use of small doses. Such claims
are plainly therapeutic exaggerations and therefore in conflict with Rule 6.
Even should these be removed, the preparation must be held an unessential
modification of the official tincture, and therefore in conflict with Rule 10.”</p>

<p>The report was agreed to by the committee and adopted by the Council and
Minson’s Soluble Iodin “Kelpidine” declared inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>NUTONE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>NuTone (NuTone Company, Lowell, Mass.) is a “nutritive tonic” said to
have the following complex composition:</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">Cod Liver Oil, Pure Norwegian, 25 per cent.<br />
Malt Extract, 9<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> per cent.<br />
Beef juice,<br />
Glycerine,<br />
Hypo­phosphite Lime, Hypo­phosphite Soda, Chemically pure, 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;grs. each to the oz.<br />
Fl. Ext. Nux Vomica, <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> of a <ins title="Transcriber’s note: originally read ‘mimimum’">minim</ins>  in each teaspoonful.<br />
</p>

<p>It is advertised with claims that will lead thoughtless physicians and a
confiding public to depend on it in cases in which fresh air, hygienic surroundings
and nutritious food are of prime importance.</p>

<p>A sample package (the phrase “as recommended by your physician” and
other statements suggest that it is expected to be given the patient by the physician
and thus effectively advertise NuTone to the public) describes NuTone
as an “Agreeable Concentrated Nutritive Tonic Emulsion of Malt Extract,
Beef Juice and Cod Liver Oil, Combined with Nerve Tonics and Bone
Nutrients.” Emphasizing the nutritive value of this “Malt Extract, Beef Juice,
and Cod Liver Oil” preparation, it is advised, “As NuTone is rich in nutritive
properties, it is well to begin with one-fourth teaspoonful, gradually increasing
to regular dose, which is: Adults, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls after meals and at bedtime.
Children according to age.” It thus appears that adults are to take this
preparation as a “nutritive” in doses which represent from 3 to 12 grains of
sugar (on the assumption that malt extract may contain as much as 50 per
cent. sugar) and 8 to 30 minims of cod liver oil with unstated, but probably
equally small, amounts of beef juice.</p>

<p>A consideration of the negligible food value of NuTone as well as of the
inefficiency of the other components and the claim that it is indicated in
“malnutrition,” “wasting diseases” and “incipient phthisis” classes NuTone
with that large group of shotgun mixtures which do harm in that dependence
<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>is placed on them in conditions in which the patient will probably be restored
to health if proper medical and hygienic measures are adopted in time.</p>

<p>The Council declared NuTone inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
because it is an irrational shotgun mixture advertised indirectly to the public
with unwarranted therapeutic claims and a nondescriptive thera­peutically suggestive
name.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1917,

<h3>TRI-ARSENOLE, L.&nbsp;O. COMPOUND NO. 1 AND
L.&nbsp;O. COMPOUND NO. 2</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p><b>Tri-Arsenole.</b>&mdash;According to the advertising of the Medical Supply Company
of Atlanta, Ga., “Tri-Arsenole” is “Merco-Arseno-Benzo-Chloride,” and
the claim is made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This compound is the result of many years’ research. The toxicity has been fully
tested upon animals before using clinically, the latter having proven such complete success,
we take pleasure in presenting it to the public&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“The manufacturers of <span class="lowercase smcap">TRI-ARSENOL</span>, before placing it upon the market, tested it
biologically.”</p></div>

<p>Tri-Arsenole is “recommended and suitable for the treatment of primary,
secondary, tertiary and hereditary syphilis. It has also been found very
useful in pellagra and malaria.” The preparation is supplied in ampules containing
varying amounts of the dry substance. It is to be dissolved in water
and is to be administered intravenously. In the advertising attention is called
to the yellow color of Tri-Arsenole; this, and the style of package suggest
that it is a preparation similar to salvarsan.</p>

<p>In reply to a request sent the Medical Supply Company for the quantitative
composition and chemical formula of the compound “Merco-Arseno-Benzo-Chloride”
and for the details of the biologic test by which its toxicity is
claimed to have been determined and evidence for its efficiency, the following

<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>
<p>The request for information regarding the animal experiments said to have
determined the toxicity was ignored, nor were references supplied to clinical
reports demonstrating the value of the product.</p>

<p>The Council declared Tri-Arsenole inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because of conflict with the rules as follows:</p>

<p>In the absence of details of the method used, the claim that the preparation
has been tested biologically is in conflict with Rule 2, which requires that for
preparations claimed to be physiologically standardized the method of testing
must be published so as to permit of control by independent investigators.</p>

<p>The claims that “Merco-Arseno-Benzo-Chloride” is “the result of many
years research,” that its “toxicity has been fully tested upon animals before
using clinically” and that clinical use has “proven such complete success” have
not been substantiated by evidence and must be held as unwarranted.</p>

<p>The name is in conflict with Rule 8, which requires that pharmaceutical
mixtures shall bear names descriptive of their composition. Further, the name
“Tri-Arsenole” by its similarity to Diarsenol, the Canadian brand of arseno-phenolamin
hydrochlorid, suggests that this pharmaceutical mixture is a
chemical compound similar to salvarsan. Moreover, the danger of confusion
is increased by the addition of the hydrastis preparation which imparts a yellow
color like that of salvarsan to the solution obtained when the colorless mercury
and arsenic compounds of the mixture are dissolved. Again, the synonym
“Merco-Arseno-Benzo-Chloride” conveys the false impression that Tri-Arsenole
is a definite chemical compound.</p>

<p>The label does not declare the poisonous constituents claimed to be contained
in the mixture; namely, “arsenous acid” and corrosive mercuric chlorid
(Rule 7).</p>

<p>There is no evidence that arsenous acid (arsenic trioxid) used intravenously
is efficient and safe as a spirocheticide, and the administration of this drug in
conjunction with mercuric chlorid in fixed proportion is irrational and dangerous&mdash;particularly
so because of the implied similarity of Tri-Arsenole to arsenphenolamin
hydrochlorid (Salvarsan, Diarsenol) (Rule 10).</p>

<p><b>L. O. Compound No. 1 and L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 2.</b>&mdash;In submitting these
preparations to the Council, the Medical Supply Company stated that “No. 1”
was “composed of the following ingredients; chloral, camphor, menthol, iodin,
and oil of gaultheria, incorporated in a fatty base. Each ounce contains fifteen
grains of chloral hydrate, nine grains of resublimed iodine.” “No. 2” was said
to have the same composition as “No. 1” except that the oil of gaultheria had
been omitted. The Medical Supply Company was informed that the rules of the
Council required declaration of the amounts of each therapeutic constituent
of pharmaceutical mixtures and that, therefore, in addition to the information
furnished the amounts of camphor, menthol and oil of gaultheria should be
given for “No. 1” and the amount of camphor and menthol for “No. 2.” The
following reply was received:</p>

</table></div>

<p>It should be noted that when the preparations were submitted each ounce of
the preparation was claimed to contain 9 grains of iodin, while in the subsequent
letter the company declares that they contain only 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> grains to the ounce. If
it be assumed that the unit intended is the avoirdupois ounce, the preparation
<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>should contain 2.06 per cent. of iodin according to the first statement and 0.84
per cent. of iodin according to the second statement. While the dark color of
the preparations suggested the presence of appreciable amounts of free iodin,
the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that an examination of the specimens
submitted by the Medical Supply Company showed that “No. 1” and
“No. 2” each contained but 0.033 per cent. of free iodin; hence both preparations
are in conflict with Rule 1.</p>

<p>For both preparations the labels suggest their use for the treatment of
“septic wounds, burns, pustular processes of all varieties, and especially bronchial
troubles.” This constitutes a conflict with Rule 4. Regarding No. 1 the
advertising circular included with the trade package asserts:</p>

<p>“Its merits have been practically demonstrated in the following conditions. We invite
your especial attention to its use in diseases of the thoracic cavity, especially Bronchitis
and Pneumonia, Rheumatism, Lumbago, Migraine, Neuralgia, Orchitis, Balanitis, enlarged

action is required.”</p></div>

<p>“No. 2” is said to be especially adapted to the needs of the surgeon, it “can
be applied in any wound either aseptic or infected.” It is asserted that the
usual method of preparing patients for operation may be discarded and that
patients may be operated on after application of this ointment:</p>

Compound in operative and post operative treatment.</p>

<p>“It is a powerful antiseptic and germicide combining anesthetic, analgesic and alterative
properties.”</p></div>

<p>After attempting to discredit the approved methods of preparing the field for
surgical operations, the advertising circular continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Method of today: A liberal amount of L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 2 is applied to the
intended area of operation, massage thoroughly until absorption is complete. Patient is
ready for operation&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Both products are in conflict with Rule 6. Further, as the names of these
pharmaceutical mixtures are not descriptive of their composition, they also
conflict with Rule 8.</p>

<p>The use of complex mixtures such as these is irrational and leads to misplaced
confidence on the part of the physician; particularly when, as in this
case, neither the label nor the advertising matter gives the necessary information
regarding the composition of the preparations further than that, in accordance
with the requirements of the Federal Food and Drugs Act, the amount of
chloral is declared (Rule 10).</p>

<p>The Council declared L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 1 and L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 2
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rules 1, 4,
6, 8 and 10.</p>

<p>The Council’s consideration of Tri-Arsenole, L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 1 and
L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 2 was based on information received from the Medical
Supply Company, the correspondence being signed “Medical Supply Co., per
Dr. H.&nbsp;E. Pontius.” The findings having been sent to the Medical Supply
Company, the following reply was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(June 27, 1917) “Replying to your registered letter of this A.&nbsp;M. relative to the
Medical Supply Company’s products, will state that the party furnishing you with such
information as you have in hand was misinformed. He is no longer with this company
and whereabouts unknown.</p>

<p class="tac">Respectfully,</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap pr1">Medical Supply Company,</span><br />
(Signed) W.&nbsp;B. Lingo, President.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span></p>
<p>The Medical Supply Company then was asked to point out any statements
occurring in the report, as submitted, which the company considered to be
inaccurate; but no reply has been received to this request. The advertising sent
out by the Medical Supply Company during the last part of August contained
essentially the same statements and claims as those to which reference is made
in the preceding report. A qualitative examination of Tri-Arsenole made in
the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory indicated the presence of sodium, mercury,
arsenic, chlorid, benzoate and a hydrastis preparation. Quantitative determinations
were not made as there was no guarantee that an analysis of the present
supply would indicate the composition of that marketed later on.</p>

<p>In view of the statement of the president of the company, that the information
submitted in the letters from the Medical Supply Company was inaccurate,
Tri-Arsenole and L.&nbsp;O. Compound must definitely be placed with preparations,
the composition of which is not divulged by their owners; hence Tri-Arsenole
as well as L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 1 and L.&nbsp;O. Compound No. 2 are in conflict
with Rule 1.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1917,

<h3>UNCTOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Unctol, sold by the R.&nbsp;R. Rogers Chemical Company, San Francisco, is a
paste stated to contain approximately 40 per cent. of metallic mercury in a soap
base. It is claimed that a part of the mercury is “precipitated mercury” and
a part “mechanically comminuted mercury.” Unctol is sold as a substitute
for mercurial ointment and is to be rubbed into the skin with the aid of water.
The claim is made for Unctol that “It is more active than blue ointment
because the mercury in it (40 per cent.) is more finely divided and the lathering
still further subdivides the mercury particles and hence promotes absorption.”</p>

<p>No evidence was presented to the Council in support of the claimed superior
efficacy of mercury soap paste over the official mercurial ointment. On the
other hand, a consultant of the Council who has studied the absorption of
mercury and mercury compounds, when applied to the skin, reported that he
had used mercury preparations in which soap was the base, and that in his
opinion Unctol could have no advantage over the official mercurial ointment
from the standpoint of therapeutic effect. Moreover, the Council is advised
that some trials with Unctol at the skin clinic of Leland Stanford University
Junior School of Medicine did not confirm the claim that Unctol is more active
than mercurial ointment.</p>

<p>The Council declared Unctol inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
because: 1. The claim of superiority over mercurial ointment is not substantiated,
and constitutes an unwarranted therapeutic claim (Rule 6). 2. The
name does not indicate the composition of this pharmaceutical mixture (Rule
8). 3. The circular wrapped with the trade package advertises proprietary
preparations not accepted by the Council (Rule 4).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council

<p>In an advertising circular this claim is made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“V-E-M Unguentum Eucalyptol Compound Combining, in well-balanced proportions, the
cooling, soothing and healing virtues of Menthol with the antiseptic and deodorizing
properties of Eucalyptol, in a base of pure, neutral white Vaseline. Furnished in five
formulas as follows:</p>

<p>“V-E-M Unguentum Eucalyptol Compound: Menthol, Eucalyptol (Sander’s), White Vaseline.</p>

<p>“V-E-M with Ichthyol: Menthol, Eucalyptol (Sander’s), Ichthyol, White Vaseline.</p>

<p>“V-E-M with Stearate of Zinc: Menthol, Eucalyptol (Sander’s), Stearate of Zinc, White
Vaseline.</p>

<p>“V-E-M with Camphor: Camphor, Eucalyptol (Sander’s), White Vaseline.</p>

<p>“V-E-M with Boric Acid: Pulv. Boric Acid, Eucalyptol (Sander’s), White Vaseline.</p>

<p>“For local application in the treatment of affections of the nose and throat.</p>

<p>“The efficacy of these combinations of remedial agents is so well established as to
preclude the necessity of more than passing mention. What is obvious is that in acute
coryza, in chronic and acute nasal catarrh, in dry catarrhal conditions especially, in both
forms of chronic rhinitis&mdash;atrophic and hypertrophic&mdash;in the latter stages of the prevailing
grippe colds, and even in hay fever, V-E-M Unguentum Eucalyptol Compound affords
pronounced relief and proves a most grateful application<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Though the identity and purity of eucalyptol are provided for by the
standards of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, the claim is made that the product
contained in these preparations “transcends in purity and efficiency all other
brands.”</p>

<p>A package of V-E-M Unguentum Eucalyptol Compound, recently sent to a
physician, contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If your head is all stuffed up to-night, or you feel a cold coming on, use V-E-M just
before going to bed. It will break up the cold, and you’ll wake up in the morning, with
your head clear and feeling fine all over.</p>

<p>“If you suffer with chronic or acute catarrh, use V-E-M regularly night and morning.
You’ll be agreeably surprised at the relief it will give you in a short time.</p>

<p>“There is nothing quicker, nothing surer to alleviate rhinitis, grippe-colds, or hay fever.</p>

<p>“In a word&mdash;V-E-M is the best antiseptic ointment for all diseased conditions of the
nose<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The Council declared these preparations in conflict with its rules because
unwarranted therapeutic claims were made for them (Rule 6); because the
public was advised to depend on them in the treatment of diseases (Rule 4),
and because these combinations of ingredients, in fixed proportions, under
proprietary names, are irrational (Rules 8 and 10).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council

<h3>HEMO-THERAPIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Hemo-Therapin has been adopted by the Council,
and its publication authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>According to the Hemo-Therapin Laboratories of New York City:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hemo-Therapin is a combination of highly refined creosols and phenols (which have
been detoxicated by special processes) with salts of iron, potassium, sodium, phosphorus and
calcium in minute but physiologic proportions&mdash;the solution as a whole being designed to
approximately closely in various fundamental details the chemistry of the blood.”</p></div>

<p>No statement is made as to the quantities of the several ingredients, nor is
any information given as to the identity of the “creosols” and “phenols,” nor
the nature of the processes whereby these are “detoxicated.” It is further
claimed that it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The composite character of Hemo-Therapin, the relative proportion and balance
of its several ingredients, and the action of the compound as a whole, to which its
potency is due.”</p></div>

<p>And it is suggested that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It will be apparent that the ingredients which enter into the composition of Hemo-Therapin,
a remedy used intravenously exclusively, have been selected with the utmost
care with the object of assuring not only maximum therapeutic potency but also <i>absolute
safety and freedom from all dangers of toxic or other unpleasant or harmful action</i>.” [Italics
in the original.]</p></div>

<p>The advertising does not explain, however, why the complex preparation
should be thera­peutically efficient or why the intravenous administration of
this mixture should be absolutely safe and free from toxic or harmful action.
Of the origin of Hemo-Therapin it is said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For many years Dr. E.&nbsp;B. Witte, a prominent physician of Trenton, N.&nbsp;J. [apparently
owner of the Hemo-Therapin Laboratories] has devoted himself to the study of the blood.
As a result of his researches, he early determined that when the blood is close to normal
standards, the body is well nourished, the natural waste products are properly eliminated,
an effective resistance is offered to the invasion of pathogenic bacteria, and the various
functions of the body are kept normally active. But when, for one reason or another,
the blood falls away from normal standards, the nutrition of the body suffers, the elimination
of waste products is impaired, the resistance to germ attack is weakened, and the various
functions of the body become sadly deranged and perverted. In other words, instead of
the physiologic processes of the body being normally active, as soon as the blood is
depreciated, they become depressed or deranged, with a loss of the physiologic harmony
or equilibrium that constitutes a state of health.</p>

<p>“Recognizing the relation of clinical conditions to these various phenomena, Dr. Witte
reached the conclusion that the correction of many aberrant or diseased conditions depended
on restoring the blood to as near to its normal state as possible. He accordingly applied
himself especially to investigation of the chemistry of the blood, with the object of
evolving a substance in liquid form that would so closely approximate normal blood in its
essential chemical characteristics that when introduced into the circulation it would bring
the blood nearer to the condition in which it exists in health.”</p></div>

<p>After the usual “many years of hard painstaking labor,” Dr. Witte elaborated
a “fluid meeting the foregoing conditions” and now the Hemo-Therapin
Laboratories inform us that 5 to 10&nbsp;c.c. of this synthetic blood administered
once in one, two or three days in “acute affection” and at longer intervals in
“chronic ills”&mdash;once a week is said to be usually sufficient&mdash;will restore blood
to a normality and empower it to overcome most ills. While disclaiming that
“Hemo-Therapin is an infallible panacea,” the medical profession is asked to
believe that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In erysipelas, septicemia, pyemia, the acute fevers, puerperal infection, furunculosis,
carbuncles, malaria, acute rheumatism, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and in various skin
diseases, such as eczema, psoriasis, herpes zoster, etc., the results have been prompt and
gratifying.”</p></div>

<p>It is “no less effective” in such “chronic ailments” as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. diabetes, chronic Bright’s disease, goiter, pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic rheumatism,
the severe anemias, arterio-sclerosis [<i>sic</i>], various nervous disorders, locomotor
ataxia, varicose and indolent ulcers<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Evidence of the virtues of Hemo-Therapin is submitted as a series of
“case reports”&mdash;unsigned&mdash;which bear a striking likeness to the testimonials
of “patent medicine” almanacs. A specimen of the “case reports” is the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Blood Poisoning due to Snake Bite.</i>&mdash;Case 9.: Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;; age, 52; was bitten
by a poisonous snake&mdash;a copperhead&mdash;seventeen years ago. On the anniversary of the
bite the arm would swell to more than twice its normal size and there would be pain, chills
and fever. After a month of this the acute symptoms would disappear and the arm
would show large scaly blotches which upon being removed would disclose a thin mucous
liquid. Throughout the seventeen years pain was constant, being particularly acute in
midsummer around the anniversary of the bite. This patient had consulted many physicians
during the seventeen years of suffering without any relief. Large doses of narcotic remedies
were necessary each day to subdue the pain. Twenty-four hours after the first injection
of Hemo-Therapin all pain was dissipated. After four treatments the patient was considered
well and there has been no return of any of the symptoms since the last treatment six
months ago.”</p></div>

<p>Hemo-Therapin is sold in ampules: 6 for $5 and 12 for $10, and a circular
sent to a physician contained this typewritten note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Fees.</span>&mdash;While the physician’s fee is not regulated by this company, the physicians who
use Hemo-Therapin get $5.00 and $10.00 for each treatment.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>VENOSAL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Venosal has been adopted by the Council, and its
publication authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Venosal” is one of the products of the Intravenous Products Company,
Denver, Colo. Its composition has been variously, and obscurely, described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Venosal is a sterile solution representing 1&nbsp;gm. (15.4&nbsp;gr.) of salicylates in combination,
together with colchicum.”</p>

<p>“This is a product for intravenous use. The composition of which is Sodium Salicylate,
15.4&nbsp;grs. (1&nbsp;gm.), Iron Salicylate a minute quantity and the equivalent of approximately
2&nbsp;grs. Dried Colchicum Root.”</p></div>

<p>None of these “formulas” gives the quantity of the product containing the
1&nbsp;gm. of salicylate, etc., but presumably it refers to the contents of 1 ampule
or 20&nbsp;c.c. This inference is in accord with the analysis of the product made
in the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association. The
analysis also brought out the fact that the amount of iron in a given ampule
was 0.0008&nbsp;gm. (about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>80</sub></span> grain). This trace of iron in the presence of salicylate
gives the product a purple color.</p>

<p>Venosal is recommended for the treatment of “rheumatism,” meaning, the
context would indicate, infectious rheumatic fever. As colchicum has no
special action on this disease and as there is no apparent reason for the
<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>employment of the trace of iron present, these additions in fixed proportions
are unscientific, if not absurd. According to the advertising matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Venosal <span class="ell">..</span>. eliminates unpleasant digestive disturbances which frequently forbid
the use of salicylates by mouth and, in addition, insures their full therapeutic value.”</p></div>

<p>The statement is misleading, as the cases in which the oral administration
of the salicylates is contraindicated are not “frequent” but exceptional and
there is no evidence to justify the implication that the “full therapeutic value”
of salicylates cannot readily be attained by their oral use. Still more astonishing
is the following claim:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Venosal is a combination carrying the true salicylates (sodii) in doses much larger
than given by mouth. With this preparation given intravenously, there is no nausea or
disagreeable digestive after-effects, tinnitus aurium, or the accumulating effects of the
drug; yet the specific action of the salicylates seems to be increased many-fold, according
to reports received.”</p></div>

<p>What are the facts? By mouth sodium salicylate is given in doses of from
3 to 15&nbsp;gm. in a day; whereas Venosal is advised as 1&nbsp;gm., in from one to
three day intervals; as a matter of elementary arithmetic it is plain that these
doses of Venosal are smaller instead of being “much larger.” The absence of
digestive ill effects, tinnitus, etc., is explained by the small dosage. That the
specific action of the salicylates should be increased by intravenous administration
is surprising when it is remembered that the drug is absorbed rapidly
and completely from the intestines; in fact, the quoted statement is incredible.</p>

<p>The company further alleges that, on the basis of “clinical reports” it has
received, it does not “hesitate to recommend this product for routine use in all
strepto­coccic infections.” Such a therapeutic suggestion is, to put it conservatively,
gross exaggeration.</p>

<p>The whole question of the justification of using salicylates intravenously is
open to grave doubt. Since it is possible to obtain the salicylate effects
promptly and certainly by oral administration, the inherent dangers of intravenous
medication render its routine employment unwarranted. A further
objection to Venosal, especially at this time when economy is a national policy,
is the unnecessarily high expense of Venosal itself and of its administration.</p>

<p>The referee recommends that Venosal be declared ineligible to New and
Non­official Remedies because of conflicts with Rule 1 (indefinite chemical
composition), Rule 6 (therapeutic exaggerations) and Rule 10 (unscientific
composition).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 5, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>SECRETIN-BEVERIDGE AND THE U.&nbsp;S. PATENT LAW</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Two years ago the Council published reports on two proprietary preparations
said to contain secretin, namely, “Secretogen,” sold by the G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick
Company (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 1, 1915, p.&nbsp;1518), and “Duodenin,”
sold by Armour and Company (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 14, 1915, p.&nbsp;639).
These reports explained that there was no evidence to indicate that an insufficient
amount of secretin was the cause of gastro-intestinal diseases, and
further that there was no evidence that secretin in any form was physiologically
active when administered by the mouth.</p>

<p>Subsequently, A.&nbsp;J. Carlson and his co-workers, at the request of the Council,
studied the question of the stability of secretin and demonstrated (<span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 15, 1916, pp.&nbsp;178 and 208) that commercial secretin
preparations contained no secretin and, further, that secretin given both by the
<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>mouth and even in enormous doses directly into the intestine is entirely
inactive.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of Professor Carlson’s work the attention of
the Council was called to a U.&nbsp;S. patent issued, May 2, 1916, to James Wallace
Beveridge, “Means for and Method of Stabilizing Secretin.” In this patent
Beveridge claimed to have invented “The process of producing secretin in
stable form as a commercial article for therapeutic use&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” that is, a
process for preparing preparations which would contain secretin when they
reach the consumer and in a form resisting destruction in its passage through
the stomach.</p>

<p>In view of the demonstrated instability of secretin, the Council asked
Professor Carlson to investigate the validity of the claims of the Beveridge
patent. The study on “The Question of the Stability of Secretin,” by A.&nbsp;J.
Carlson, A.&nbsp;E. Kanter and I. Tumpowski, which appears below, shows that the
Beveridge patent furnishes no process for the manufacture of commercially
stable secretin preparations, nor any means for preventing the destruction of
secretin by the gastric juice when administered orally. It further demonstrates
that the preparation made by Beveridge was devoid of secretin.</p>

<p>The Council adopted the report of Carlson and his co-workers, and declared
Secretin-Beveridge inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>The Council directed that the report of Carlson and his collaborators be
sent to the Commissioner of Patents with a protest against the granting of
patents without competent and thorough investigation of the claims advanced
therein.</p>

<h3>THE QUESTION OF THE STABILITY OF SECRETIN</h3>

<p class="author">A. J. Carlson, A. E. Kanter and I. Tumpowski</p>

<p class="tac fs85">[From the Hull Physiological Laboratory of the University of Chicago]</p>


<p>In a letters patent, filed May 6, 1914, the patent granted May 2, 1916, James
W. Beveridge, M.D., makes certain claims concerning the stability and physiologic
activity of secretin prepared according to the method patented by him.</p>

<p>In brief, Dr. Beveridge claims that secretin prepared by digesting intestinal
mucosa with a weak acid at a temperature slightly below boiling, and mixed
with 0.2 per cent. to 2 per cent. blood serum, albumin or peptone (1) remains
active for at least six months, (2) stimulates the pancreas when given by
mouth, and (3) “may be injected intravenously in man, if desired.” The only
thing in the letters patent in support of these claims is the statement: “I
have found out by actual tests that the preparation maintains its stability for
five or six months.”</p>

<p>Here are the claims in detail:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the source of secretin I preferably use that part of the alimentary tract of any
lower animal&mdash;such as a hog or sheep&mdash;including the gastric pylorus, the duodenum and
the jejunum. This part is split open and washed with a normal saline solution to clean
the mucosa or mucous membrane of any detritus which may be present. The mucosa
with the epithelial cells is then removed or separated from the muscular wall by scraping
with a blunt knife or in any other suitable way. The scrapings or cuttings, which contain
the secretin, are then macerated or broken up.”</p>

<p>“The macerated mass is placed in a suitable vessel and subjected to the action of an
acid solution until digested. The time for the digestion of the mass will, of course, depend
upon the strength and temperature of the acid solution employed. The stronger the solution
and the higher the temperature, the shorter the time necessary for complete digestion. This
period may vary from several minutes to several hours. In my experiments I found that
the best results were obtained with hydrochloric acid solution of one-tenth to five-tenths
of one per cent. in strength, although as high as eight-tenths per cent. might be used. The
mixture is brought to a temperature of approximately 210&nbsp;F., and it may even for a few
moments exceed that temperature, but it should be kept below the boiling point, for
<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>excessive heat injures or breaks down the secretin molecule and impairs or destroys its
activity. Although I prefer to use hydrochloric acid, I would have it understood that
other acids&mdash;both organic or inorganic&mdash;may be employed, provided that the percentage of
acidity is regulated to prevent a chemical change in the secretin, and further provided,
of course, that the acid has no injurious effect on the human system.”</p>

<p>“After the mass has been digested in the heated solution, the decoction is decanted,
and after being allowed to cool is passed through a suitable filter until the filtrate is clear.
I found that by filtering the decoction from four to six times through a carbon filter, I
obtained a clear colorless filtrate. This is a solution of secretin and the acid which was
used, and the clearness of the solution shows that it is practically free from albumoses,
gelatin and other impurities (such as cell tissues, etc.) present in the raw material under
treatment.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the solution of pure and active secretin prepared as above explained, there is
added a suitable quantity of blood serum&mdash;say from one-fifth to two per cent. or any
equivalent medium&mdash;such as albumin solution or a peptone solution&mdash;which will aid and
sustain the activating power of secretin as provided by the blood. That is to say, any
medium having the same power, similar quality or chemical composition that the blood-stream
possesses in combining with secretin to stimulate the pancreas. The addition of such
a medium to the active secretin solution increases the potency of the secretin and its degree
<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>of stability by preventing oxidation or deterioration thereof. If this strengthening or
fortifying medium, as it may be properly termed, is alkaline, it performs the additional
function of lowering the acidity of the secretin filtrate. It is preferable that the final product
be just faintly acid. If desired, the final product may be made into an elixir by the
addition of aromatics.”</p>

<p>“Any desired strength of secretin solution may be obtained according to the quantity
of acid solution. In my experiments I used from ten to fourteen duodena to a pint of
acid solution.”</p>

<p>“The solution of secretin prepared as above described is characterized by its ability
to resist oxidation or deterioration for a sufficient period of time to render the solution
available as a commercial article, and is furthermore characterized by freedom from
poisonous and irritable chemical substances, whereby the secretin is chemically adapted
to the human system to stimulate the pancreas to increased secretion.”</p>

<p>“As previously stated, the secretin prepared according to my method may be administered
orally to produce the desired physiological action. Of course, if desired, the secretin
might be injected intravenously, but this more or less dangerous procedure is not at all
necessary, and I merely mention it here to point out that when I refer to the oral administration
of my new secretin preparation, I do not mean to exclude its administration by
injection.”</p>

<p>“As to the commercial stability of the secretin prepared according to my method, I may
say that I have found by actual tests that the preparation maintains its stability for as long
a period as five or six months. When I refer to my product as being “commercially stable,”
I mean that it resists oxidation or deterioration for a sufficient period to render the same
available as a commercial article. This period may vary from several weeks to several months,
depending upon certain commercial factors well understood by the manufacturer. So, roughly
speaking, I should say that secretin is commercially stable when it retains its activity from one
to six months. I do not wish to be understood, however, as limiting myself to these exact
figures.”</p></div>

<p>That active secretin may be extracted from macerated intestinal mucosa by
weak acids below the temperature of boiling is well known. In fact, weak acids
at body temperature in contact with the duodenal mucosa lead to the formation
of secretin. The claims that secretin given by mouth reaches the blood and
acts on the pancreas has been made for other preparations of secretin. It has
also been shown that these claims are erroneous<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_122_128" id="FNanchor_122_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_128" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> Thus it would appear that
the only novel element in Dr. Beveridge’s patented secretin is the addition of
serum, soluble proteins or peptones. What reason is there for believing that
this will render the secretin stable for months, and physiologically active when
taken by mouth? We do not believe Dr. Beveridge ever injected his secretin&mdash;protein
mixture&mdash;intravenously in man or animals not under anesthesia,
otherwise he would not have stated: “Of course, if desired, the secretin may
be injected intravenously.”</p>


<h5>BEVERIDGE’S PATENTED SECRETIN IS NOT STABLE</h5>

<p>I. <i>The Samples of Secretin Sent Us by Dr. Beveridge.</i>&mdash;Physiological tests
were made on four quart bottles of the secretin kindly sent us by Dr. Beveridge
June 26, 1916. According to a letter from Dr. Beveridge of July 20, 1916, those
samples of secretin were prepared June 20, that is, only six days before received
by us. The material came in dark colored bottles. It was kept in the original
bottles and placed in the ice box immediately on receipt. Dr. Beveridge stated
the secretin “should remain active until the month of November, 1916, at least.”</p>

<p>Tests were made on three out of the four bottles. The fourth bottle was not
opened, as we desired to learn what change it might undergo in the way of
protein precipitation and bacterial decomposition. There is nothing in the
Beveridge method of preparation that insures a sterile secretin unless it is
passed through a Berkefeld filter. In all our crucial experiments the animals
(dogs) were kept under light ether anesthesia, a cannula inserted into the
pancreatic duct, the blood pressure recorded from the carotid artery and the
various secretin preparations injected intravenously. When inactive secretin
preparations were encountered, control tests were always made with active
<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>solutions of secretin to eliminate possible individual peculiarities of the animal.
Thus when the pancreas of a dog reacts to the injection of preparation <i>A</i>, but
not to preparation <i>B</i>, it is evident that absence of response to <i>B</i> is due to this
preparation and not to the animal or to the experimental conditions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">

of secretin (twenty hours old) made by us according to the Beveridge method. Showing
that the secretin preparations sent us by Dr. Beveridge contained no secretin.</div>
</div>

<p>Each of the three samples of secretin sent us by Dr. Beveridge was tested
in the above manner on five dogs. The first tests were made June 27, 28 and
29, respectively, that is, within nine days of the preparation of these samples
of secretin. <i>None of the samples was active (Fig.&nbsp;1), even when injected
intravenously in quantities up to 50 c.c.</i>: 40–50&nbsp;c.c. of Beveridge’s secretin
mixture may kill a dog by too great lowering of the blood pressure. A good
secretin preparation yields a copious secretion of pancreatic juice on intravenous
injection of a few cubic centimeters.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to prepare a secretin, by the original Bayliss or Starling
method or by the Beveridge method, that retains some activity for a longer
period than nine days. Hence we cannot account for the absolute inactivity
of these preparations except on the assumption that they did not contain any
secretin to start with; that is, faulty preparation and absence of physiologic
standard­ization.</p>

<p>The sample kept intact in its original container for six months became
gradually cloudy, a large mass of amorphous precipitate settled to the bottom
and the odor showed bacterial decomposition. It is reprehensible, to say the
least, to state concerning such a mixture: “Of course, if desired, it may be
injected intravenously.” The fact that Beveridge’s secretin may be rendered
clear by filtering through carbon is not sufficient evidence that it is “pure
secretin,” free from bacteria and other injurious substances.</p>

<p>II. <i>Beveridge Secretin Mixture Is Rapidly Rendered Inactive by Human
Gastric Juice.</i>&mdash;We prepared active secretin solutions by the Beveridge method,
using 0.2 per cent. serum as the protein “stabilizer” (?). The addition of the
serum does not appear to affect the activity of the fresh secretin preparation.
If Beveridge’s secretin is able to act on the pancreas when given by mouth, it
is obvious that it must run the gamut of gastric digestion, except in cases
of complete achlorhydria. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that all other
secretin preparations are rapidly destroyed by pepsin-hydrochloric acid digestion.
Is Beveridge’s secretin an exception? What is there in a little serum,
native albumin, or peptones to protect secretin against gastric digestion?</p>

<p>The pure human gastric juice used in these tests was secured from the
fistula case (Mr. F.&nbsp;V.) that has been under observation in our laboratory
for years<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_123_129" id="FNanchor_123_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_129" class="fnanchor">123</a></span></p>

<p><i>Two cubic centimeters of fresh gastric juice added to 8–10&nbsp;c.c. Beveridge
secretin, the mixture being kept at body temperature (38&nbsp;C.), renders the secretin
completely inactive in from 5 to 8 minutes</i> (Fig.&nbsp;2). There is no exception to
this rule, as we have repeated the test on many different secretin preparations
and using different samples of human gastric juice. The secretin of Beveridge
is just as vulnerable as the secretin of Bayliss and Starling to pepsin-hydrochloric
acid digestion. On what kind of tests does Beveridge base his
claim that his secretin mixture acts on the pancreas when given by mouth?</p>

<p>III. <i>The Relative Rate of Deterioration of the Secretin Solutions Prepared
According to Bayliss and Starling and According to Beveridge.</i>&mdash;Six different
preparations of the two kinds of secretin were made, kept in dark stoppered
bottles in the ice box, and tested by intravenous injection in dogs under ether
anesthesia from time to time until all influence on the pancreas had been lost.
One typical series of these tests is given by the way of illustration. (See
Table on page <a href="#Page_126">126</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/175.jpg" width="520" height="366" alt="" />
<div>Fig.&nbsp;2.&mdash;Records of carotid blood pressure and flow of pancreatic juice on intravenous injection
of secretin prepared by us according to the Beveridge method. <i>X</i>, injection of 10&nbsp;c.c. of
the secretin; <i>b</i>, record of flow of pancreatic juice in drops. Tracing <i>A</i>, the 10&nbsp;c.c. of
Beveridge’s secretin injected had been digested for five minutes with 3&nbsp;c.c. of human gastric
juice. Tracing <i>B</i>, injection of 10&nbsp;c.c. of the same secretin preparation not subjected to gastric
digestion. Showing rapid and complete destruction of Beveridge’s secretin by human gastric
juice.</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the rate of deterioration (oxidation or decomposition)
of the secretin is practically the same whether prepared according to Bayliss
and Starling or according to Beveridge (Figure 3). In both preparations the
rate of deterioration is most rapid the first few days after preparation. It is
scarcely necessary to point out that secretin preparations not kept constantly
at low temperature and in the dark, as in the above experiments, will deteriorate
more rapidly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span></p>

<p>Why can we hope that the addition of serum or any solution of protein
will render secretin more stable? In the intact man or animal under normal
conditions of digestion, secretin reaches the pancreas by way of the blood, that
is, it is in solution in blood. Does that fact render the secretin stable? By
no means. The reader is familiar with the fact that the response of the
pancreas to a single intravenous administration of secretin is very transitory
(5–15 min.). The cessation of activity is due, not to fatigue of the pancreas,
as a second injection of secretin gives a prompt response of pancreatic secretion,
but to the disappearance of active secretin from the blood. In fact,
secretin left in the test tube or in the bottle remains active over a much longer
period of time than when introduced into the blood stream.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Beveridge’s Secretin Given by Mouth to the Intact Animal Has No
Specific Action on the Pancreas.</i>&mdash;Active secretin prepared according to the
method of Beveridge was fed on an empty stomach to a small dog (5 kilo)
with permanent fistula of one of the pancreatic ducts. On control days we
gave the dog (<i>a</i>) equal quantities of n/10 HCl, and (<i>b</i>) bread and milk. The
Beveridge secretin was prepared with 0.3 per cent. HCl and the addition of
0.2 per cent. serum. The results may be stated by the following summary:</p>

<p>The Control experiments with pure hydrochloric acid show that the secretion
of pancreatic juice following the introduction of Beveridge’s secretin into the
stomach is due to the acid factor and the protein content.</p>


<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>The patented secretin of Beveridge is rendered inactive by gastric juice,
is without effect when given by mouth, and exhibits no greater stability or
keeping qualities than the secretin prepared according to Bayliss and Starling.
It has no merit as a therapeutic agent. It should under no conditions be
administered intravenously in man, as it contains deleterious protein split
products and living bacteria.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 12, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>NEED FOR PATENT LAW REVISION</h3>

<h4>Report of the Committee on Patent-Law Revision of the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association</h4>


<p>At the present critical time when the efficiency of this nation must be raised
to the highest point, it is essential that the United States government should
lead in the efforts tending to such increased efficiency. To bring this about
the government must protect and stimulate science, art and industry and at
the same time curb or prevent waste of the country’s resources. In this field
the United States Patent Office has unlimited power for good and evil&mdash;good,
in the issuance of patent grants for novel devices and substances which go to
increase national efficiency; evil, in the granting of patent protection where
such protection is not in the interest of national efficiency, conservation of
energy and material resources.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span></p>

<p>For years the American Medical Association, in common with the national
pharmaceutical bodies, has been urging amendment of the law which governs
the issuance of patents on medicinal preparations and more particularly revision
of the procedure under which such patents are issued. At the Chicago (1908)
meeting of the American Medical Association a special committee of five was
appointed by the House of Delegates to study the questions involved, and to
cooperate with the Association’s committee on medical legislation in preparing
and securing the enactment of a bill which would correct the abuses connected
with the enforcement of our patent laws (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 13, 1908,
p.&nbsp;2003). This committee presented a comprehensive report at the Atlantic
City (1909) meeting of the American Medical Association (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 19, 1909, p.&nbsp;2063). A further report was presented at the St.
Louis (1910) meeting of the American Medical Association (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 18, p.&nbsp;2079). In 1911 (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 25, 1911,
p.&nbsp;1780) the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical
Association issued a report which set forth the inadequacy of our patent laws
as they are administered in relation to medical products particularly.</p>


<h5>AGAINST PUBLIC INTEREST</h5>

<p>Since that time the Council has continued its study of the U.&nbsp;S. Patent law
as it applies to medicine and has become convinced that in many instances
the patent law or its enforcement is contrary to the best interest of the public,
both as concerns health and prosperity. The Council feels it a duty at this
time to protest against the provisions of our patent law, or the methods of
its enforcement, which permit the granting of patents without thorough and
scientific investigation of the claims advanced in such letters patent. As one
means of improving conditions the Council urges that the U.&nbsp;S. Public Health
Service, the Bureau of Chemistry, U.&nbsp;S. Department of Agriculture and other
scientific departments of the United States government conversant with medicines
and related subjects be consulted before the issuance of patents on
medicinal preparations.</p>

<p>In support of the Council’s contention that the patent law procedure requires
revision, the following is offered: In 1912 a U.&nbsp;S. Patent (No. 1,031,971) was
granted on a cresol derivative, metacresyl acetate, a product described in
chemical literature in 1903. When the Council inquired as to the grounds for
the issuance of a patent for a substance known to science, the Patent Office
replied that it was not familiar with the publication in which metacresyl
acetate had been described. It seems evident that this patent would not have
been issued had the application first been submitted to a government department
familiar with chemical literature.</p>

<p>An illustration of the granting of a patent on the use of well-known
chemical bodies which present no discovery or originality, is the patent issued
for the use of peroxids, perborates and percarbonates as ingredients of tooth
powders (U.&nbsp;S. Patents Nos. 760,397 and 802,099). Regarding these patents
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association (Sept. 20, 1913, p.&nbsp;978)
commented:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The patents held by McKesson and Robbins give this firm the exclusive right of manufacturing
tooth powders containing peroxids, perborates and percarbonates. It is another illustration
of the unfair monopolies that may be secured under our present patent laws.”</p></div>


<h5>GRANTING A PATENT TO A NOSTRUM</h5>

<p>Again in 1913 U.&nbsp;S. Patent No. 1,081,069 was granted to a citizen of
Switzerland (a country which does not grant patents on medicinal preparations)
for a “composition which is intended to be used internally and which confers
to the organisms immunity against the following microbial infectious illnesses:
<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span><i>diphtheria, pneumonia, typhus, scarlet fever, influenza, septic infections, cerebral-spinal
meningitis, syphilis, pest, cholera and tuberculosis; it is also effective in
another kind of disease, viz., goiter</i>.” (Italics not in original). The patent
specification states that “The principal of these substances is creatinin&nbsp;<span class="ell">…</span>,”
but offers no evidence whatever that this well-known chemical body has the
extensive and miraculous powers claimed for it. In publishing a notice of this
patent <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association (Jan. 3, 1914,
p.&nbsp;54) explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It appears that the inventor is dead, and that his estate took out the patent. Since this
great benefactor should have been, by the use of his preparation, immune to practically all
diseases, he must have died of senility, although this seems hardly to have been the case.”</p></div>

<p>and held:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Assuredly granting patents on such claims ought to be sufficient to show the need of a
change in the methods of granting patents&mdash;at least of the methods governing the issuance of
patents for medicinal products.”</p></div>

<p>We submit, that had the department of the government entrusted with the
enforcement of the federal Food and Drugs Act been consulted as to the claims
of this patent, it would probably have advised that, if the absurd and palpably
fraudulent claims set forth in this application for a patent were made on the
label of a preparation of creatinin offered for sale in interstate commerce or
in the District of Columbia, the vendor would be prosecuted.</p>

<p>In 1914 there was issued U.&nbsp;S. Patent No. 1,086,339. Here the “inventor”
declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is the object of my invention to destroy parasitic micro-organisms, particularly on living
tissue without injuring the latter, by progressively evolving sodium hydroxid contiguous to said
tissue, from and in a moist mixture of calcium hydroxid, sodium carbonate, aluminum sulfate
and boric acid&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>In a word, this patent apparently was granted for the production of sodium
hydroxid by a chemical reaction which had been in use for several centuries.
Because the patentee had twisted the granting of this patent into a quasi-endorsement
of his nostrum, the Council’s consideration of this preparation was
sent the Patent Office as a protest against the present law which authorizes
the granting of patents on unproved and improbable medical claims. At that
time the Council was informed by the Patent Office that reforms in the
issuance of patents for medicinal substances had been instituted, and that “the
trouble will not be so pronounced in the future as it has been in the past.”</p>


<h5>FLAVORING EPSOM SALT A “DISCOVERY”</h5>

<p>There was issued early in 1917 U.&nbsp;S. Patent No. 1,212,888 for a method of
flavoring Epsom salt&mdash;yet this “discovery” is a procedure which has been
practiced ever since the cathartic action of this bitter salt has been known.
Not only does the patent describe a process long known to physicians and
pharmacists, but it sets forth claims that the flavored cathartic salt produced
by the process cures flatulency, indigestion, sick and sour stomach, colic and
destroys worms. In commenting on this patent <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American
Medical Association (June 23, 1917, p.&nbsp;1914) was constrained to remark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The splendid conception of the framers of our constitution in providing a plan for promoting
progress in science and useful arts by granting to inventors for a limited time the
exclusive use of their inventions, in exchange for the publication of full knowledge thereof, is
being debased. No branch of our government is of greater importance to the progress of the
country than the patent office, provided that office is intelligently administered. When the
patent office is used, however, for an extension of the nostrum business, founded on the abuse
of patent and trade-mark laws, it becomes a menace to the public health. The objects of the
patent law are being defeated by the practices of the patent office.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span></p>
<p>Still further, attention is called to U.&nbsp;S. Patent No. 1,226,394 for a process
of making hexa­methylen­amin tetraiodid and on the product so produced. This
patent was issued after the Council had notified the Patent Office that
hexa­methylen­amin tetraiodid had been discovered in 1888 and that a process
identical in principle with that for which patent application appeared to have
been made was published in 1916. On the basis of claims for which no
evidence is produced this patent is issued for a well-known substance on the
ground that as previously produced it contained a little free iodin or that the
known processes were less economical. This patent appears to be an illustration
of our patent procedure which obliged American users of acetyl­salicylic
acid to pay an exorbitant price because this country granted a patent which
gave to the patentee, a foreigner, the exclusive right to the manufacture of the
substance, whereas no such patent was issued in the patentee’s own country
nor, so far as we can learn, in any other country. It forcibly illustrates the
need for a revision either of our patent laws or of their methods of enforcement
or both.</p>


<h5>THE BEVERIDGE PATENT</h5>

<p>In further justification of the Council’s protest against the provisions of
our present law, or the methods of its enforcement, which permit the granting
of patents without thorough and scientific investigation of the claims advanced
in such letters patent, the Council calls attention to the report, appearing above,
of an investigation made by A.&nbsp;J. Carlson, A.&nbsp;E. Kanter and I. Tumpowski,
“The Question of the Stability of Secretin,” which relates to U.&nbsp;S. Patent No.
1,181,424, issued to James Wallace Beveridge.</p>

<p>Whereas the regulations governing the issuance of patents demand that
the processes shall be described in such detail that one versed in the sciences
can confirm the claims made by the patentee, no pretense whatever of fulfilling
this requirement is made in the patent specifications of this patent.
The substance of the first three paragraphs of this patent has long been
general knowledge. Nearly every sophomore medical student has himself
performed, or seen performed such “experiments” as are therein described. The
claims of novelty evidently are confined to the assertion that the preparation
is able to “resist oxidation or deterioration”; that it is free from “poisonous
and irritable chemical substances”; that it “may be administered orally to
produce the desired physiological action.” etc., etc. Not the slightest hint is
given as to how any person can substantiate these claims. As a matter of
fact, the investigation of Professor Carlson and his co-workers has shown
that a preparation having the properties claimed cannot be made by the process
described in this patent. Any one familiar with the subject could have demonstrated
readily that the applicant was withholding information concerning
essential features of his process, assuming that he had any information on the
subject (which he probably did not have) and would have advised against the
issuance of the Beveridge patent.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 12, 1918</i>.)</p>

<h3>SURGODINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report submitted by a referee was adopted by the Council and
authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Surgodine (Sharp and Dohme, Baltimore, Md.), according to an advertising
pamphlet, is a solution of 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> per cent. of iodin in alcohol, containing no
alkaline iodid, but miscible with water in all proportions. The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
<span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>Chemical Laboratory reports that Surgodine is an alcoholic liquid (containing
91.8 per cent. alcohol by volume) containing free iodin, combined iodin and
free acid, probably hydrogen iodid (hydriodic acid). Quantitative estimations
gave 2.51&nbsp;gm. free iodin per 100&nbsp;c.c. and 1.78&nbsp;gm. combined iodin (the greater
part apparently was present as hydrogen iodid).</p>

<p>It is therefore similar to several other iodin preparations already considered
by the Council. Like these, it is essentially similar to the official tincture of
iodin, except that it is considerably weaker, and instead of potassium iodid
it presumably contains hydrogen iodid and probably ethyl iodid to render the
iodin water-soluble. Its composition, however, is secret.</p>

<p>There would be no objection to the use of ethyl iodid or hydrogen iodid,
except perhaps the acidity of the latter, as a solvent agent rather than of
potassium iodid. But neither is there any important advantage, and these
preparations would have to be considered as unessential modifications of official
preparations, and therefore ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>The attempt to make these modifications commercially profitable, however,
seems inevitably to lead to exaggerations and misstatements. In an advertising
pamphlet the following claims for Surgodine are unsupported by any evidence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But from the surgical viewpoint the addition of this potassium salt is most objectionable
because when such solutions as the official tincture are used locally in the antiseptic treatment
of open and often infected wounds the Potassium Iodide acts as an irritant to the wound and
therefore produces a localized irritation which is not only objectionable from the surgical
standpoint but also materially lessens the antiseptic power of the Iodine itself.”</p>

<p>“It has been demonstrated repeatedly that Iodine without the admixture of any alkaline
iodide is much more efficient as a surgical antiseptic than any iodine solution that contains such
an addition.”</p>

<p>“Iodine does not produce ‘iodism’ as quickly as the alkaline iodides do because it is
eliminated more quickly and more perfectly than the alkaline iodides.”</p></div>

<p>The next statement intimates that iodin taken by mouth enters the intestinal
tract unchanged and is there free to combine with various gases:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Iodine in the presence of phosphorated or sulphurated gases in the gastro-intestinal tract
unites with their hydrogen and thus breaks up these noxious compounds.”</p></div>

<p>This is certainly untrue at least for ordinary doses.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Surgodine be held inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because its composition is secret (Rule 1); because the
therapeutic claims made for it are exaggerated and unwarranted (Rule 6);
and because it is an unessential modification of the official tincture of iodin
(Rule 10).</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Comment.</span>&mdash;Surgodine is a good illustration of the economic
waste inseparable from most proprietary medicines. A hospital pharmacist
writes that whereas his hospital obtains tincture of iodin at less than 82 cents
a pint, Surgodine costs $2.13 a pint. This means that while the free-iodin
strength of Surgodine is only about one-third that of the official tincture,
its price is between two and three times as high.]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>MEDEOL SUPPOSITORIES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Medeol Suppositories has been adopted by the
Council, and its publication authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span></p>
<p>“Medeol Suppositories” (Medeol Company, Inc., New York) appear to be an
imitation of “Anusol Suppositories” which, in 1907, were found to be inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies. A comparison of the composition
and of the claims made for the two preparations will be of interest in the
present consideration of Medeol Suppositories:</p>

</table></div>

<p>“Anusol” was formerly said to be bismuth iodo­resorcin­sulphonate. The
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory published a report in 1909 showing that the
suppositories contained only 1 per cent. of the iodin declared in the “formula,”
and were greatly deficient in bismuth and sulphur. After the publication of
the report the American agents for the product disclaimed that “Anusol” was
a definite chemical compound. Today Anusol Suppositories are said to contain
unstated amounts of the indefinite “bismuth oxyiodid and resorcin­sulphonate.”</p>

<p>“Medeol” is said to be “resorcinated iodo bismuth,” but no information is
vouchsafed as to the character or composition of the ingredient. The therapeutic
claims made for the two preparations are similar, as the following, taken
from circulars, show:</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="box1 fs85">
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Anusol Suppositories</span></p>

<p>An innocuous, non-irritant remedy for anal,
rectal and vaginal inflammatory affections,
especially for <span class="smcap">Hemorrhoids</span>!</p>

<p>The local medicinal treatment of hemo­rrhoid­al
and other inflammatory ano-rectal
conditions has always been un­satis­factory.
The usual media cannot be applied in effective
concentration without producing intense inflammatory
reactions; they are either ineffective
or intolerable<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>Anusol suppositories are absolutely free
from narcotic, caustic or other injurious in­gredi­ents
and may unhesitatingly be used by
both sexes, at any age and under all conditions.</p></div>

<div class="box1 fs85 vat">
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Medeol Suppositories</span></p>

<p>An innocuous, Non-irritant, Efficient Anti­phlogistic
for use in inflammatory diseases of
the rectum, anus and vagina especially in
<span class="smcap">Hemorrhoids</span>.</p>

<p>Hitherto most of the local remedies used in
these conditions have either been too irri­ta­ting
to be employed in sufficient con­cen­tra­tion
to be efficient or they have lacked efficiency
per se<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>Medeol suppositories do not contain any
narcotic or any caustic or other constituent
having violent action; their blandness permits
of their use in either sex and at all ages.</p></div></div>

<p>The claims made for these preparations&mdash;as for instance “that surgical
treatment <span class="ell">..</span>. should rarely be undertaken until Medeol Suppositories have
been given a thorough trial”&mdash;are misleading in that they create the inference
that the limitations in the palliative treatment of piles have been overcome.
It is altogether untrue that these mixtures can be expected to “relieve the
most obstinate cases,” as stated in a Medeol circular. This, from an Anusol
circular, is equally misleading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If dietetic and other requirements are complied with, even the most obstinate chronic cases
will frequently readily yield to treatment with Anusol Suppositories.”</p></div>

<p>The Council declared Medeol Suppositories inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because their composition is secret (Rules 1 and 2); because
unwarranted therapeutic claims are made for these (Rule 6); because the
name is objectionable (Rule 8), and because the combination is unscientific
(Rule 10).</p>

<p>In those cases of hemorrhoids in which palliative measures may be expected
to enable the patient to avoid surgical interference and afford relief from attacks,
the object should be to secure cleanliness, to avoid irritation, whether it be
<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>by friction or irritating fecal matter, to reduce inflammation by astringents
and, when necessary, to relieve pain by analgesics. If an antiseptic dusting
powder is desired, boracic acid in impalpable powder with talc may be
employed; if an astringent, finely powdered oxid of zinc may be added; if a
local analgesic is necessary, a little extract of belladonna may be incorporated
with petrolatum or other ointment base. The main reliance, in any event, should
be to effect normal bowel movements by regulating the diet rather than by the
use of purgatives; the use of warm water to insure cleanliness; the avoidance
of irritation, especially that caused by friction and secretions; a mild astringent
to reduce inflammation.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 9, 1918</i>)</p>

<h3>GUAIODINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Guaiodine, marketed by the Intravenous Products
Company, Denver, has been adopted by the Council and its publication
authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>A referee of the Committee on Pharmacology, in submitting to the Council
a report from the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory on Guaiodine, advises that
the Laboratory’s examination shows that instead of containing free “colloidal”
iodin as claimed, the preparation is essentially an iodated fatty oil, containing
only combined iodin. Equally misleading, in view of the Laboratory’s findings,
are the implied claims that the antiseptic action of Guaiodine corresponds
to that of free iodin.</p>

<p>Guaiodine is advertised mainly for the treatment of gonorrhea. While it
may be true that the guaiacol contained in Guaiodine has some beneficial effect,
especially when preceded by potassium permanganate irrigation as advised,
the advertised claim that “Guaiodine acts as a specific for gonorrhea in a
majority of cases” is utterly false.</p>

<p>The “case records” offered to establish the therapeutic value of Guaiodine
are in themselves sufficient to condemn the “evidence.” The following are
fair samples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The second boy came a day or so later with a slight discharge with the characteristic
burning and itching, and with symptoms of a beginning gonorrhea, and judging from the
source of the infection, it was believed to be so. Two injections of Guaiodine were given when
the discharge ceased.”</p>

<p>“I have several cases that were completely cured in a very short time. I note this, that
the first dose causes a cessation of the discharge and the second seems to increase the flow, but
the color is changed. I give three doses, and then use a mild wash, and in ten days they are
well. I am very pleased with this preparation and very truly believe that it is the best there
is to date for the positive cure of gonorrhea.”</p></div>


<h5>REPORT OF THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY</h5>

<p>Guaiodine is manufactured by the Intravenous Products Company, Denver,
Colorado. The “literature” which accompanies the product describes Guaiodine
as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. an electro-chemically prepared iodin, suspended in oil, containing iodin, the same
strength as the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. tincture of iodin, or 7 per cent., together with a therapeutic dose of
guaiacol.”</p></div>

<p>The Intravenous Products Company claims that Guaiodine is made by an
“electro-chemical process of preparing colloidal iodine,” discovered by one
E.&nbsp;B. Page, and that by this process the tendency of iodin to produce iodism
has been “overcome.” It is said to be “pre-eminently an antiseptic and
<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>germicide.” Guaiodine is a dark brown, oily liquid with a specific gravity of
0.9845 at 15.6&nbsp;C. and an odor suggestive of guaiacol. Its solubilities were
those of a fat. Free iodin was absent in the recently purchased specimen
(traces were present in an older one). Steam distillation indicated that the
product consisted of volatile and nonvolatile constituents. The volatile matter
was concluded to consist, in the main, of guaiacol or some guaiacol-like body,
and the nonvolatile matter to be an iodized fatty oil. Quantitative determinations
indicated that Guaiodine contained about 7.25 per cent. of iodin in combination,
and that it is composed approximately of 3 per cent. volatile matter
and 97 per cent. nonvolatile matter. Hence Guaiodine appears to be an iodized
fatty oil to which a small amount of guaiacol or some guaiacol-like substance
has been added.</p>


<h5>THE COUNCIL’S ACTION</h5>

<p>On the recommendation of the referee, the Council voted that Guaiodine
be declared inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because of false
statements as to composition and action.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April
6, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>SEVERAL “MIXED” VACCINES NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The “mixed” vaccines which are discussed in the reports that follow were
considered by the Council during the past year because inquiries had been
received in regard to them.</p>

<p>In publishing these reports it is desirable that the attitude of the Council
toward “mixed” vaccines again be stated. In view of the rapid development
of bacterial therapy, the possibility for harm that attends the use of bacterial
vaccines and the skepticism among experienced clinicians as to the value of
vaccines representing a combination of organisms, the Council has felt that
it should scrutinize the claims for such agents with exceptional care and that
there should be admitted to New and Non­official Remedies only those vaccine
mixtures for which there is acceptable evidence to indicate that the use of the
particular mixtures is rational.</p>

<p>In considering the subject the Council has borne in mind the fact that
in many institutions in which cases are studied and the results of therapeutic
measures carefully observed and controlled, vaccines of any sort are practically
never used&mdash;certainly here the stock mixed vaccine has no recognition.
Experienced clinicians have generally come to the conclusion that mixed
vaccines have no specific action and that any effect they may produce is due
to a non-specific protein reaction.</p>

<p>As set forth in the reports, in no case was the evidence submitted by the
proprietors sufficient to establish the claims made for the preparations. Hence
none was accepted for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>The preparations that form the basis for the accompanying reports are only
a few of the many that are being made and sold by some biological houses.
Doubtless many of those not dealt with in this report are equally irrational
and sold under claims equally&mdash;or probably even more&mdash;unwarranted than those
with which the present report deals.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h4>Mixed Vaccines-Abbott</h4>

<p>In response to inquiry the Council undertook a consideration of the following
“mixed{”} vaccines sold by the Abbott Laboratories:</p>

<p><i>M. Catarrhalis-Combined-Bacterin</i>, said to contain killed Micro­coccus catarrhalis,
Bacillus Friedländer, Pneumo­cocci, Strepto­cocci, Staphylo­coccus aureus
and Staphylo­coccus albus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span></p>
<p><i>B. Coli-Combined-Bacterin</i>, said to contain killed Strepto­coccus viridans,
Strepto­coccus hemo­lyticus and Bacillus coli.</p>

<p><i>Pertussis-Combined-Bacterin</i>, said to contain killed Bacillus pertussis, Pneumo­cocci,
Strepto­cocci, Staphylo­coccus albus, Staphylo­coccus aureus and Micro­coccus
catarrhalis.</p>

<p><i>Strepto­coccus-Rheumaticus-Combined-Bacterin</i>, said to contain killed “Strepto­cocci
(Rheumaticus, Viridans, etc.)” and Pneumo­cocci.</p>

<p><i>Strepto­coccus-Viridans-Combined-Bacterin</i>, said to contain killed Strepto­coccus
viridans, Strepto­coccus hemo­lyticus, Pneumo­coccus and Staphylo­coccus
albus.</p>

<p>The Abbott Laboratories were asked to assist in the investigation of these
products and to submit evidence to establish their eligibility for admission to
New and Non­official Remedies. The manufacturer was informed that the
Council accepts “mixed” vaccines or bacterins, provided the usefulness of these
products is established by acceptable clinical evidence, and references to the
literature bearing on the value of the preparations were requested.</p>

<p>The Abbott Laboratories submitted specimens of the products, the advertising
matter therefor and a considerable list of references to current literature;
all of which was transmitted to the Committee on Serums and Vaccines for
consideration. In due time a referee of the committee submitted the following
report:</p>


<h5>THE COMMITTEE’S REPORT</h5>

<p>The referee has studied the literature covered by the references submitted.
In general the articles are favorable to the use of vaccines, though many of
these papers do not consider “mixed” vaccines; indeed, a number of the articles
do not discuss treatment at all, but are devoted entirely to the consideration of
etiology of the disease. Many of the papers are by those who are obviously
overenthusiastic on the subject of the use of biologic preparations. One paper&mdash;not
included in the references submitted by the Abbott Laboratories&mdash;records
an alarming reaction following a dose of mixed vaccine; no claim is made
that improvement followed.</p>

<p>The following comments on the submitted references are offered:</p>

<p><i>M. Catarrhalis-Combined-Bacterin.</i>&mdash;Only four of the nine references given
deal with the therapeutic use of the vaccine. The reported results in general
were favorable, but sometimes in the discussion evoked by certain of the papers,
views the reverse of those expressed by the author were brought forward. The
enthusiasm of one writer is shown in his statement that following the use of
vaccine in cases of carbuncle complicating diabetes the sugar in the urine
disappeared or was reduced. One observer, who reports excellent results in
nasal pharyngeal catarrh, speaks of certain vaccines as “bulk goods,” while
another considers “&mdash;&mdash;’s No. 7” as the proper thing. It is evident that the
reports are not based on careful, scientific data, or such unscientific definition
of the product employed would not be used.</p>

<p><i>B. Coli-Combined-Bacterin.</i>&mdash;In the references cited in support of this
preparation the following general statements are noted: One enthusiastic
writer says, “It must be recognized that we have no satisfactory explanation
of the action of vaccines, and their use at present is empirical.” One author
dwelt on the superiority of autogenous vaccines but admits that occasionally
stock vaccines are indicated. One vaccine therapist in concluding an article
states, “It is simply impossible to practice modern urology without our modern
biologic products.” Yet it is a well-known fact that many successful and
capable genito-urinary surgeons avoid the use of vaccines, mixed or simple.</p>

<p><i>Pertussis-Combined-Bacterin.</i>&mdash;These reports are uniformly favorable, but
are not controlled and their value is not to be compared with a recent report
<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>from the New York City Department of Health which indicates that the
vaccine is practically valueless. It is noted, further, that one of the articles
cited which dealt rather fully with the treatment of pertussis did not mention
vaccines.</p>

<p><i>Strepto­coccus-Rheumaticus-Combined-Bacterin.</i>&mdash;The references cited in support
of the preparations by the manufacturer give no support whatever for the
use of mixed stock vaccines. The first reference deals with the relation of
Strepto­coccus viridans to arthritis deformans and endocarditis and reports the
following cases:</p>

<p class="ml1em fs85">
<i>Case 1.</i>&mdash;Vaccine case&mdash;improvement after eight months.<br />
<i>Case 2.</i>&mdash;Slight improvement following use of vaccine.<br />
<i>Case 3.</i>&mdash;Slight improvement following use of vaccine.<br />
<i>Case 4.</i>&mdash;Marked improvement.<br />
<i>Case 5.</i>&mdash;Prompt improvement.<br />
<i>Case 6.</i>&mdash;Vaccine not mentioned.<br />
<i>Case 7.</i>&mdash;Vaccine followed by slight improvement.<br />
</p>

<p>In each of the cases other methods of treatment were used. The paper
shows the etiologic relation of Strepto­coccus viridans rather than the value
of vaccines. There is no indication that stock vaccines were used, though
the paper is not clear on this point. The second paper deals with the application
of vaccine therapy in the treatment of arthritis. This paper is by a
man who is avowedly an enthusiast on vaccine therapy. The indications are
that he generally used a mixed autogenous vaccine, but the reports of cases
are not always clear. This writer apparently makes no serious attempt at
the classification of the joint conditions he treats. The third reference is a
purely experimental study and has no bearing on the use of vaccines in
treatment. The fourth article was admitted by the manufacturer to be “negative
as regards evidence.” The fifth reference specifically states that “the
vaccine must be autogenous.” The sixth reference deals with the experimental
production of appendicitis by the use of diplococci, and has not the most
remote bearing on the use of vaccines in the treatment of rheumatism.</p>

<p><i>Strepto­coccus-Viridans-Combined-Bacterin.</i>&mdash;The article which bears evidence
of more care than the others admits that we are not in position to state the
value of vaccines in pyorrhea but the author believes they may have value
supplementary to local treatment.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that a large number of favorable reports can be
accumulated when we appreciate how promptly men report what they consider
to be their successes and how commonly they leave their failures unrecorded.
Bearing in mind the fact that these stock mixed vaccines, though before the
profession for many years, have not been used, or continued in use, in hospitals
where work is rigidly controlled and that they are used practically not at all
in the large government hospital service, a candid critic must hold that there
is no substantial evidence in favor of the therapeutic use of a mixed vaccine,
certainly not for stock “goods” and that probably there is but a limited field
for the employment of autogenous vaccines.</p>

<p>The referee calls attention to a shift in the advertising matter on vaccines&mdash;the
tendency to recommend vaccines to be used in conjunction with drugs.
A heading in the Abbott booklet reads, “The Biologics Do Not Replace Drugs”;
and the paragraph speaks of serums and bacterins as “new tools, supplemental
to those we already have, but not replacing them.” <span class="ell">..</span>. “We need them
both.”</p>

<p>The referee recommends that the several mixed vaccines discussed in this
report be not accepted on the grounds that satisfactory evidence of their value
is wanting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span></p>
<p>Having been endorsed by the Committee on Serums and Vaccines the Council
adopted the report and declared M. Catarrhalis-Combined-Bacterin, B. Coli-Combined-Bacterin,
Pertussis-Combined-Bacterin, Strepto­coccus-Rheumaticus-Combined-Bacterin
and Strepto­coccus-Viridans-Combined-Bacterin ineligible for
admission to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>


<h4>Catarrhal Vaccine Combined-Lilly and Influenza Mixed Vaccine-Lilly</h4>

<p>Because of inquiry received, the Council requested Eli Lilly and Company
to aid in determining the acceptability of the following products for New and
Non­official Remedies: “Catarrhal Vaccine Combined,” said to contain killed
cultures of the Bacillus of Friedländer, Micro­coccus catarrhalis, Staphylo­coccus
aureus and albus, Pneumo­coccus and Strepto­coccus; “Influenza Mixed
Vaccine,” said to contain killed cultures of Staphylo­coccus albus and aureus,
Strepto­coccus, Pneumo­coccus, Micro­coccus catarrhalis and Bacillus influenzae.</p>

<p>Lilly and Company sent the circulars, etc., used in advertising these products.
A circular for “Catarrhal Vaccine Combined” contained the following claim:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Catarrhal Vaccine has been especially useful in many respiratory infections, including
bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, chronic catarrh and in the mixed infections of pulmonary
tuberculosis.”</p></div>

<p>A circular for “Influenza Mixed Vaccine” contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The vaccine is useful in the treatment of influenza and ordinary colds, and in any infection
in which the Bacillus influenzae is the causative agent.”</p></div>

<p>An advertising pamphlet contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Catarrh, Acute and Chronic; Colds, Influenza.&mdash;The micro-organisms capable of producing
catarrhal conditions of the nose and pharynx and most commonly isolated are B. Friedländer,
M. catarrhalis, staphylo­coccus, pneumo­coccus (in infections beginning in the larynx), <i>B.
influenza</i> and strepto­coccus. These organisms are found normally in the respiratory passages
and acquire virulence only when resistance has been lowered through overwork, exposure to
cold, etc.</p>

<p>“The results following the use of Catarrhal Vaccine Combined (in the non-epidemic forms)
and influenza Mixed Vaccine (in the epidemic types) have been very satisfactory, due to the
great vascularity of the tissues. Acute attacks are aborted altogether or shortened in duration
and the danger of complications greatly minimized.”</p></div>

<p>No evidence was submitted which warrants the preceding claims nor is the
Council aware of any reliable testimony to indicate that the administration of
the mixture here discussed is warranted or desirable. On the recommendation
of the Committee on Serums and Vaccines the Council voted that “Catarrhal
Vaccine Combined-Lilly” and “Influenza Mixed Vaccine-Lilly” be not included
in New and Non­official Remedies because satisfactory evidence of their value
is wanting.</p>


<h4>Influenza Serobacterin Mixed-Mulford</h4>

<p>Because of inquiry received, the Council took up the consideration of
“Influenza Serobacterin Mixed-Mulford,” and requested the Mulford Company
to present evidence to establish the admissibility of the preparation to New
and Non­official Remedies. The Mulford Company sent specimens of the serobacterin
in question, an advertising circular and a letter by the director of its
Biologic Laboratories.</p>

<p>According to the label on the package, the preparation is made from the
following organisms: Bacillus influenzae, Staphylo­coccus aureus, Staphylo­coccus
albus, Strepto­coccus, Pneumo­coccus and Micro­coccus catarrhalis
(group). This mixture is recommended by the manufacturer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the prophylaxis and Treatment of Common Colds, Mixed Infections of the Respiratory
Mucous Membranes, Acute and Chronic Catarrhal Conditions of the Nose, Throat and Respiratory
Passages.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span></p>
<p>No evidence is submitted for this recommendation except that in “colds
and bronchitis and the other common infections of the upper respiratory passages <span class="ell">..</span>.
five or six bacteria are very commonly present&mdash;two or more of
them are nearly always present&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” and the letter by the director of the
Mulford Biologic Laboratories expressing the belief that in his own case the
use of the mixed vaccine has aborted or prevented colds.</p>

<p>As regards the use of this complex biologic preparation:</p>

<p>First, the cause of common colds is, at the present time, quite unknown.
One of the most striking things is that at the beginning of a cold the organisms
to be cultivated from the nasal mucous membrane are very few in number and
there is no uniformity in the type of organism found. If someone of the well-known
organisms (Strepto­coccus, Staphylo­coccus, Pneumo­coccus, Micro­coccus
Catarrhalis, Influenza Bacillus, etc.) were responsible, we should expect to find
one of them preponderating and in overwhelming numbers. This is far from
the case. After the duration of the cold for a day or two with the increased
production of mucus and apparently with the infection of a mucous membrane
whose powers of resistance have been greatly lowered, bacteria of all kinds
are to be found in immense numbers. There is considerable reason for believing
that an ultramicroscopic organism is responsible for this condition (See
Foster, <i>Journal of Infectious Diseases</i> <b>21</b>:451 [Nov.] 1917).</p>

<p>Second, there is no acceptable clinical evidence that vaccination with the
influenza bacillus, the Strepto­coccus, the Pneumo­coccus or the Micro­coccus
Catarrhalis will influence the course of an infection due to one or the other
of these organisms. It has been repeatedly found that a staphylo­coccus vaccine
is of a certain degree of value when the infection with the staphylo­coccus is
localized, but it is well known that general systemic infections with the staphylo­coccus
are not at all benefited.</p>

<p>Third, the letter submitted as evidence by the Mulford Company is not
convincing. The Council is not prepared to accept evidence of this sort unless
it is in volume large enough to justify a definite conclusion.</p>

<p>Holding that there is no evidence for the value of this mixture, the Council
declared “Influenza Serobacterin Mixed-Mulford” inadmissible to New and
Non­official Remedies because its use is illogical.</p>


<h4>Sherman’s Mixed Vaccine No. 40</h4>

<p>Because of inquiry received the Council decided to consider this preparation
and requested the manufacturer, G.&nbsp;H. Sherman, Detroit, Mich., to submit
evidence in support of the claims made for it.</p>

<p>This vaccine is said to be made from killed cultures of Strepto­coccus, Pneumo­coccus,
Micro­coccus catarrhalis, Staphylo­coccus aureus, and Staphylo­coccus
albus. In the printed matter sent out by G.&nbsp;H. Sherman this vaccine is recommended
for hay-fever, in which it is stated that some of the symptoms are due
to bacterial invasion of the respiratory mucosa; for tonsillitis, both as a
remedy and as a prophylactic against rheumatic and other sequelae; for
“throat infections”; for rhinitis with the claims that acute coryza can be aborted
within twenty-four hours; for pneumonia in which it is advised for all stages;
for laryngitis, for bronchitis, and for asthma.</p>

<p>No acceptable evidence was submitted as to the value of the product in the
treatment of any of the foregoing conditions. In view of what is known about
non-specific reactions, it seems likely that any influence which this vaccine may
have on the diverse conditions enumerated by the manufacturer, is due to this,
rather than to the combination of organisms used in its preparation.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on Serums and Vaccines, the
Council declared “Sherman’s Mixed Vaccine No. 40” ineligible to New and
Non­official Remedies because the therapeutic claims made for it are unwarranted
<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>(Rule 6) and because the combination, in view of its complexity, is
irrational and detrimental to sound therapy (Rule 10).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 23, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>OPHTHALMOL-LINDEMANN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Ophthalmol-Lindemann was taken up for consideration by the Council because
of inquiries received. The following report, declaring Ophthalmol inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies, was adopted by the Council and its publication
authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Ophthalmol-Lindemann (Innis, Speiden and Co., New York) is advertised
as a treatment for eye diseases by “hyperemia.” The circular advertising the
product is written somewhat in the style of “patent medicine” advertisements. It
contains testimonials of dubious value. The principle underlying the use of
Ophthalmol is that employed to a considerable extent by ophthalmologists,
through the use of ethylmorphine (“dionin”), etc., viz., the production of conjunctival
irritation in inflammatory eye diseases. Ophthalmol is, therefore,
merely a special agent for the production of such ophthalmic irritation.</p>

<p>The advertising circular contains no evidence that Ophthalmol is in any
respect superior to the established agents for producing conjunctival hyperemia.
On the other hand, there are obvious objections to the use in the eye of a
substance of unknown and apparently indefinite composition and uncertain
activity. Ophthalmol is said to be an oily solution of “glandular extract of the
fish Cobitis Fossilis.” <i>Cobitis fossilis</i> is a small fish said to be common in
Germany. According to Kochs, who analyzed Ophthalmol (<i>Arb. a. d. Pharm.
Inst. d. Univ. Berl.</i>, <b>4</b>:140, 1907), this fish is popularly believed to predict
weather, but medical virtues are not ascribed to it. This “fishy” extract is
indefinite, to say the least.</p>

<p>The activity of the preparation is described by the manufacturer thus: “It
seems probable that the typical action of Ophthalmol is due to certain organic
acids which may have formed during manufacture through the decomposition
of protein bodies contained in the crude material.” The profession is not told
whether this important decomposition is, or, in fact, can be controlled so as to
produce a material of uniform activity.</p>

<p>Kochs concluded from his analysis that Ophthalmol had the properties
of rancid olive oil containing about 6 to 7 per cent. mineral oil. The oil contained
no nitrogen, left no ash on ignition and though traces of iodin were
claimed to be present, no iodin could be found.</p>

<p>It is recommended that Ophthalmol be rejected first, because the use in the
eye of an irritant of secret composition and uncertain activity is unscientific
and against the interest of public health; second, because Ophthalmol is of
secret composition (the composition claimed being practically meaningless),
and, third, because no evidence has been submitted to substantiate its claimed
superiority over established methods of treatment. The Council declared
Ophthalmol inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 6, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>SILVOL INELIGIBLE FOR N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Silvol (Parke, Davis &amp; Company) was adopted by
the Council and its publication authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span></p>

<p>The Council took up the consideration of Silvol (Parke, Davis &amp; Company)
because of inquiries received. The following report was submitted by the
referee in charge of silver preparations:</p>

<p>Silvol (Parke, Davis &amp; Company) is a silver-protein preparation of the
Argyrol type. Like Argyrol, it is said to contain about 20 per cent. of silver.
The referee finds that, like Argyrol, it is nonirritant to the nasal mucosa in
a 10 per cent. solution; does not precipitate with chlorid; dissolves in water
readily; a 25 per cent. solution has a high specific gravity (Silvol, 1.137 at 20
C.; Argyrol, 1.147 at 20&nbsp;C.), and is not very viscid (viscosity, 1.25). A 1:1,000
solution of Silvol is clear and about 50 per cent. deeper in color than a solution
of Argyrol of the same strength.</p>

<p>Silvol differs from Argyrol mainly in that its solutions yield a fine precipitate
with egg albumin (under suitable conditions), while Argyrol is nonprecipitant;
and in that Silvol solutions are not so effectively decolorized by
Lloyd’s reagent.</p>

<p>The manufacturers did not reply to an inquiry with regard to the basis for
the claims made for Silvol (see <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>). The referee was therefore obliged
to deduce these claims from the firm’s advertising matter. About the same
claims are made for the local use of Silvol as are generally made for Argyrol.
These may be accepted without detailed evidence in view of the similarity of
the two preparations.</p>

<p>Its usefulness, as suggested in the advertising, when given by mouth “in
the treatment of acute or chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, or gastro-enteritis,”
or the efficacy of very dilute solutions (0.2 per cent.) against dysentery, etc.,
is doubtful and requires substantiation by evidence. The claims that Silvol is
astringent, though nonirritant and noncoagulant, that it is a “powerful germicide”
or even that it is a “powerful antiseptic,” and that it may be used with
advantage wherever “a silver salt is indicated,” need substantiation. There
is no proof of the assertions that Silvol is “the most efficacious of silver salts”;
“the most efficient antiseptic,” and “the most remarkable organic silver compound&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>As the manufacturers have not presented any evidence for their highly
improbable claims, and as they have not signified any intention of making their
claims agree with substantiated facts, it is recommended that Silvol be declared
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>The Council adopted the report of its referee and authorized its publication.</p>


<h5><a id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h5>

<p>The following letter from the Secretary of the Council was sent to Parke,
Davis &amp; Company, March 20, 1917. No reply to it has been received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The referee of the Council who is conducting an investigation of silver preparations asked
me to inquire if you are willing to submit your evidence for the following claims which are
made in your circulars for Silvol:</p>

<p>1. How it is possible for the solution to be astringent, and at the same time nonirritant and
noncoagulant?</p>

<p>2. That intestinal irrigation with a Silvol solution containing 10 to 15 grains to the pint is
sufficiently bactericidal to “be used in the abortive treatment of such infectious processes as
dysentery, cholera infantum, and colitis.”</p>

<p>3. What evidence have you as to the degree of antiseptic and germicidal power of Silvol
solutions?</p>

<p>4. What evidence have you as to the degree of antiseptic and germicidal power of 5 per
cent. Silvol Ointment?</p></div>

<p>A reply to the above questions and any other information in regard to
Silvol will receive careful consideration.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July

<h3>KATHARMON</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Following inquiries, the Council took up “Katharmon” for consideration and
authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Katharmon Chemical Company of St. Louis in advertising its Katharmon
appeals especially to a profession whose members, should they live up
to their ethical code, could not prescribe it<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_124_130" id="FNanchor_124_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_130" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> In 1893 (when the publication of
“a formula” for proprietary preparations was thought to satisfy the requirements
of scientific medicine) an advertisement in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American
Medical Association gave the following “formula” for Katharmon:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hydrastis Canadensis, Phytolacca Decandra, Acid Salicylous C.&nbsp;P. (from Oil of Wintergreen),
Acid Boric C.&nbsp;P., Mentha Arvensis, Thymus Vulgaris, Dist. Ext. Hamamelis Virg.
Conc.”</p></div>

<p>In 1907 an advertisement in the Kansas City <i>Medical Index-Lancet</i> declared
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Katharmon represents in chemical combination the active principles of Hydrastis Canadensis,
Gaultheria Procumbens, Hamamelis Virginica, Phytolacca Decandra, Mentha Arvensis,
Thymus Vulgaris, with two grains C.&nbsp;P. Boric Acid to each fluid drachm.”</p></div>

<p>Now the advertisements which appear in some medical journals state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“KATHARMON represents in combination Hydrastis Canadensis, Thymus Vulgaris,
Mentha Arvensis, Phytolacca Decandra, 10<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains Acid Borosalicylic, 24 grains Sodium
Pyroborate to each fluid ounce of Pure Distilled Extract of Witch Hazel.”</p></div>

<p>A comparison of these so-called formulas shows that they have not only
varied from time to time, but that in no instance was a quantitative statement
with regard to all the asserted ingredients given.</p>

<p>The Chemical Laboratory of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. reports: Katharmon has an
alkaline reaction and therefore cannot contain boric acid, salicylic acid or
“borosalicylic acid” (the latter is unknown to medical literature except as
loosely applied to a simple mixture of boric and salicylic acids). The solution
gives tests for sodium, borate, and salicylate and therefore probably contains
sodium borate and sodium salicylate. Examined by the methods used for the
determination of hydrastin in goldenseal preparations, a residue giving only a
faint test for alkaloid was obtained; if present at all, hydrastis canadensis
(goldenseal) is there only in very small amounts.</p>

<p>A circular wrapped with the trade package of Katharmon contained the
following, palpably unwarranted, claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Internally</span> it is very useful in acute indigestion, Gastric Catarrh, Diarrhoea and Cholera
Infantum.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it has demonstrated its remarkable curative effects, not only in preventing
unhealthy conditions of fresh wounds, but also in correcting the decaying of putrefactive
processes peculiar to the body under certain circumstances. It has, further, a remarkable
efficacy in surface inflammations, whether produced by accident or disease, and is an indispensable
remedy in the affections of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, stomach,
bowels, vagina, uterus, urethra, bladder and rectum.”</p></div>

<p>Katharmon is in conflict with Rules 1 and 4 of the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry because of its indefinite and secret composition and the method
of advertising it indirectly to the public; it is in conflict with Rules 10, 6 and
<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>8, in that it is an irrational shotgun mixture sold under unwarranted therapeutic
claims and under a name nondescriptive of its composition.&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 10, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>IODINIZED EMULSION (SCOTT) AND CREOSOTONIC (SCOTT)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>“Iodinized Emulsion (Scott)” and “Creosotonic (Scott)” are proprietary
preparations of the Dawson Pharmacal Company, Dawson Springs, Ky. The
latter preparation used to be known as “Iodinized Emulsion (Scott) with
Hypo­phosphites, Guaiacol and Creosote.” In 1907 these preparations were considered
by the Council and found inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.
Examination of the preparations having been again requested, the Council considered
them anew because the composition and claims had been changed somewhat
and because at the previous consideration no report was published.</p>

<p>The reports which appear below were sent to the Dawson Pharmacal Company
for comment before publication. In reply the company offered to revise its
claims for the preparations. The Council replied that the report sent explained
that both preparations are irrational mixtures, and hence a revision of the
claims would not make them eligible for New and Non­official Remedies. It
advised that publication of the report would be withheld sixty days and that
it would be revised if new information or evidence was submitted permitting
such revision. After expiration of the stipulated postponement, the Dawson
Pharmacal Company wrote that no new advertising matter had been prepared,
but that the old circulars were not being sent out.</p>

<p>As these irrational preparations were still sold and advertised to the
medical profession and presumably used by some physicians, the Council directed
publication of its report with this explanation.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h4>Iodinized Emulsion (Scott)</h4>

<p>The label for Iodinized Emulsion (Scott) declares:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Each fluidram contains: Alcohol, m.&nbsp;4<span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>; Rectified Ol. of Turpentine, m.&nbsp;3<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>; Iodin,
gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span>; Phenol, gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>; Glycerine and Elixir Lactated Pepsin with Aromatic Oils in the form
of a perfect emulsion.”</p></div>

<p>A circular which gives what is asserted to be the composition of Iodinized
Emulsion, declares that, among other ingredients, each fluidram contains
“one and three quarters m. Tincture of Iodine.” Both the statement on the
label that the preparation contains “iodin” and the one in the circular that
tincture of iodin is present in the product are incorrect, for the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory reports that no free iodin could be detected in the preparation,
and that it responded to tests for iodid instead.</p>

<p>An advertising circular for Iodinized Emulsion (Scott) makes unwarranted
claims for the therapeutic properties of the constituents. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the great usefulness of Turpentine in diseases, especially of the Intestinal Infection,
such as the Meteorism and Tympanites of Typhoid.”</p></div>

<p>And this absurdity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. where Turpentine, Carbolic Acid or Iodine or even Pepsin is indicated, that it
will give satisfaction in each and every case.”</p></div>

<p>Iodinized Emulsion (Scott) is not a “pharmaceutical triumph”; it is an
irrational mixture&mdash;a reminder of a decadent polypharmacy&mdash;sold under misleading
<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>and unwarranted claims. It is inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies for conflict with Rules 1, 6, 8 and 10.</p>


<h4>Creosotonic (Scott)</h4>

<p>Creosotonic (Scott), advertised as a “reconstructive tonic” for the tuberculous,
according to the label, contains in each fluidram:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Alcohol, m.&nbsp;2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>; Creosote and Guaiacol sulphonates of each, gr.&nbsp;1; Compound Hypo­phosphites,
gr.&nbsp;1 (including Quinine Hypo­phosphites, gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>36</sub></span> and Strychnine Hypo­phosphites,
gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>256</sub></span>), with Iodinized Emulsion (Scott) m.&nbsp;30.”</p></div>

<p>As in the case of Iodinized Emulsion (Scott), the advertising makes exaggerated
therapeutic claims for the individual constituents of the preparation
and for the heterogeneous mixture of guaiacol and creosote sulphonates, hypo­phosphites,
quinin, strychnin, turpentine, phenol, iodin, “lactated pepsin,” etc.
Thus, while it is well established that in guaiacol sulphonate and creosote sulphonate
the phenolic constituent is bound so firmly that, when administered,
but very little is split off in the organism, yet the advertising claims “that the
system can be saturated in a shorter time and with smaller doses of creosote
and guaiacol sulphonates than with any other form of these drugs” and that
(on the false premise that the guaiacol and creosote from these drugs will permeate
the tissues of the lungs) “they help to clear up the local infection and
thus aid in returning to normal the diseased mucous membrane.”</p>

<p>In the advertising pamphlet, following a discussion of the effect of climate
and food in the treatment of the tuberculous, we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While admitting the great importance of the foregoing points, we are firmly of the opinion
that proper medication is a great aid in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, and, with this
in view, we offer to the profession Creosotonic (Scott) believing that in it we have a superior
preparation for this purpose.”</p></div>

<p>This is unwarranted. Of course suitable medication to meet special conditions
is proper in the treatment of tuberculosis, but the routine administration
of a complex and irrational mixture such as Creosotonic (Scott) is bound to
cause inattention to the prime requisites for the proper treatment of the tuberculous&mdash;hygienic
surroundings and good food.</p>

<p>Creosotonic (Scott) is an irrational mixture, sold under misleading and
unwarranted claims. It is inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies for
conflict with Rules 1, 6, 8 and 10.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 24, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>CAMPETRODIN AND CAMPETRODIN NO. 2</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Campetrodin and Campetrodin No. 2 has been
adopted by the Council and its publication authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The following report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory on “Campetrodin”
and “Campetrodin No. 2,” sold by the A.&nbsp;H. Robins Company, Richmond, Va.,
was submitted to the Council by a referee of the Committee on Pharmacology:</p>

<p>Campetrodin and Campetrodin No. 2, Double Strength, are called “ethical
medicinal specialties” by the A.&nbsp;H. Robins Company, Richmond, Va., which
sells them. An advertisement in the <i>Maryland Medical Journal</i> (December,
1917) contains the following claim for composition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Campetrodin</span> (Made in Two Strengths of Iodine). This preparation is an Oleaginous
Solution of Iodine in Camphor.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span></p>
<p>A booklet describing the “specialties” of the Robins Company contains the
following in reference to Campetrodin: “Composition: Camphor, Iodine Element,
Oleaginous Solvent.” From this it appears that the preparations are
claimed to contain elementary (free) iodine in an “oleaginous solvent.” Since
free iodin, as is well known, readily combines with fats, it was decided to
determine the form in which the iodin was present in these preparations. The
examination demonstrated that both preparations contained but a trace of free
iodin. On steam distillation there was obtained from both preparations a distillate
amounting to about 35 per cent. by volume which had an odor strongly
suggestive of turpentine, while the residue contained the iodin and had the
characteristics of an iodized fatty oil.</p>

<p>Quantitative determinations indicated that Campetrodin contained approximately
0.03 per cent. of free iodin and 1.3 per cent. of iodin in combination
with the fatty oil. Campetrodin No. 2, Double Strength, contained approximately
0.03 per cent. free iodin and 2 per cent. of iodin in combination with
the fatty oil.</p>

<p>Thus, contrary to the published statements, Campetrodin is <i>not</i> a preparation
of free (elementary) iodin and Campetrodin No. 2, Double Strength, does
<i>not</i> contain twice as much iodin as Campetrodin.</p>

<p>The report of the Chemical Laboratory shows that the statements made in
regard to the composition of Campetrodin and Campetrodin No. 2 are incomplete
in some respects and false in others. In view of the Laboratory’s findings
it appears superfluous to inquire into the therapeutic claims made for the
preparations: It is evident, however, that a solution containing practically no
free iodin is not, as claimed by the Robins Company, “adapted for use wherever <span class="ell">..</span>.
iodin is indicated externally<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>It is recommended that Campetrodin and Campetrodin No. 2 be declared
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because of false statements as to
chemical composition and therapeutic action, constituting conflicts with Rules
1 and 6.</p>

<p>The Council adopted the recommendation of the referee and authorized
publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 21, 1918.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>CARMINZYM</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following which explains
why Carminzym was not accepted for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Carminzym is a tablet sold by Fairchild Bros. and Foster, New York. Each
tablet contains, according to claims made, approximately 32&nbsp;mg. of an extract
of pancreas, 50&nbsp;mg. sodium bicarbonate, 172&nbsp;mg. prepared chalk, 1.5&nbsp;mg. powdered
ipecac and “aromatics <i>q. s.</i>” Without considering other possible conflicts
with its rules, the Council held the preparation inadmissible to New and
Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rule 10 which holds that unscientific
or useless articles are not acceptable products.</p>

<p>The Council holds that complex mixtures of remedial agents are, from
every point of view, inimical to therapeutic progress and therefore to the public
welfare. Such mixtures are especially objectionable because it is impossible
accurately to determine the effects which follow the simultaneous administration
of a number of drugs having dissimilar actions; because the practice of
prescribing such mixtures tends to discourage careful consideration of the
special needs of individual patients without which there can be no rational
<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>drug therapy. On the contrary, with the use of such mixture therapeutic
treatment becomes haphazard and mere guesswork.</p>

<p>The Council, appreciating that long established customs cannot be changed
at once, has applied Rule 10 concerning the recognition of mixtures with the
greatest leniency compatible with consistency. When there has been a reasonable
doubt concerning the value of a mixture it has frequently directed that
Rule 10 should not apply pending further clinical trial of such mixture. In
no instance has subsequent experience shown that a strict interpretation of the
rule would have worked hardship or injustice. The Council feels that there is
no longer warrant for the admission of complex mixtures to New and Non­official
Remedies or for the retention of any that have been admitted unless
definite evidence of the therapeutic value of such combinations is available.
In accordance with this decision several mixtures now described in New and
Non­official Remedies will be omitted at the expiration of the three year period
for which articles are accepted.</p>

<p>Reverting to the Carminzym tablet: When it is desired to obtain the effects
of pancreatic extract by oral administration it must be administered with a
view of preventing its destruction by the gastric fluid. With this end in view
an antacid should be administered to decrease the acidity of the gastric juice.
The amount of alkali may be supplied in the form of any of the official preparations,
but the amount must be adjusted to the individual patient for the
reason that no two successive patients are likely to have the same degree of
gastric acidity.</p>

<p>Ipecac has a well defined though limited field of usefulness. When it is
used, it should be given with a due regard to the amount needed by the patient
and the frequency of the repetition of the dose. There is no reason to suppose
that any two successive patients will require ipecac and extract of pancreas
in a fixed proportion and with equal frequency. As a matter of fact, the amount
of ipecac in Carminzym is so small that no definite therapeutic action can be
assigned to it and its use in this combination is purely empirical.</p>

<p>In a word, the employment of mixtures of pancreatic extract, alkalis, ipecac
and carminatives in fixed proportion leads to slipshod treatment and irrational
therapeutics. Carminzym is an irrational mixture the use of which is detrimental
to therapy.</p>

<p>The preceding report was sent to Fairchild Bros. and Foster for comment
in accordance with the Council’s usual procedure. The following reply was
received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The long established custom of the use of mixtures of remedial agents rests upon considerations
well known and generally accepted. This is equally true of combinations of drugs of
similar and dissimilar properties. The drugs of these combinations, especially those of marked
therapeutic action, are well known and used by themselves when indicated.</p>

<p>In fact, dissimilarity of action is a cause of combination, an essential of synergism.</p>

<p>Drugs classed as similar are by no means alike in action; laxatives, tonics, carminatives,
diuretics are combined with distinct advantage, economy of dose, enhanced effect, potency not
obtainable with the single drug.</p>

<p>Your sweeping arbitrary conclusions that complex mixtures of remedial agents are from
every point of view inimical to therapeutic progress is not, it seems to us, sustained by fact
and experience. There is therapeutic progress in the considerate use and observation of combinations
as well as in the use of a single drug. Indeed, in the production of a synthetic
chemical substance as a therapeutic agent, the combination of potent and dissimilar elements is
worked out to mitigate and correct an objectionable side effect, and promote desirable action.</p>

<p>As for ourselves, at the very outset in our line of work we quite voluntarily declared our
principles and our intentions as opposed to incompatible and therefore unstable or inert combinations
of the enzymes; and against the “unnecessary multiplication of preparations”&mdash;see
Fairchild’s Hand-Book of the Digestive Ferments.</p>

<p>Is not this after all the crux of the whole matter&mdash;does a combination contain the ingredients
stated, does it possess the demonstrable properties which are to be attributed to it in
consequence of this composition; and if for a certain purpose, is it well designed therefor?</p>

<p>Carminzym presents certain agents of well known properties, not in the least of incompatible
or antagonistic action, but indeed especially suitable for the particular purpose designed;
<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>its efficacy not to be measured and judged by theory or opinion as to the efficiency of a
certain dosage of a particular drug by itself. That the doses as contained are minimal and
effective is distinctly advantageous.</p>

<p>The alkaline carbonates are in Carminzym in stated quantities; the physician adjusts the
dosage to the individual patient and with obvious evidence of the efficiency of the adjustment.
As we understand it, the employment of alkaline carbonates is not based on purely chemic
considerations&mdash;a definite known quantity of acid of the gastric juice is to be neutralized; the
whole literature and practice dealing with the alkaline carbonates show them to be accredited
with a much wider field of use and repute in gastro-intestinal disorders.</p>

<p>The pancreatic extract in Carminzym is designed to be diffusible in the stomach, the tablet
is preferable to be crushed in the mouth before swallowing, and we believe the pancreatic
extract to be an effective constituent as administered in Carminzym.</p>

<p>You comment as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs100">

<p>“Ipecac has a well defined though limited field of usefulness. When it is used
it should be given with due regard to the amount needed by the patient and the
frequency of the repetition of the dose.”</p></div>

<p>This in a sense may be said of any of the most useful drugs, but not in the least special
degree does it apply to ipecac, which is, on the contrary, of quite characteristic, peculiar range
of therapeutic properties, useful in varying combinations and in widely varying proportions
and doses according to the purpose for which it is employed.</p>

<p>Ipecac in well known official alkaline, carminative, laxative preparations occurs in the
“average dose” in the varying quantities of <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>14</sub></span>, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span>, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span>, and <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub></span> of a grain.</p>

<p>The ipecac in combination with the other ingredients in Carminzym is designed for a tablet
which shall carry a minimal quantity whilst capable of adequate remedial action, thus admitting
of increase of dosage or repetition as occasion requires. The quantity of ipecac was not taken
at random, but chosen after long trial and consideration.</p>

<p>We believe that Carminzym possesses carminative properties in a superior degree and that,
furthermore, in consequence of its composition it directly stimulates the gland secretions and
thus exerts a beneficial action upon the whole digestive functions.</p>

<p>Carminzym is for use as occasion requires, and this is to be especially noted. Thus it is
not only of direct benefit, but helpful in promoting systematic therapeutic measures and
regimen.</p>

<p>The Council takes the ground that complex mixtures of remedial agents are so wrong that
there is no longer warrant for their admission into New and Non­official Remedies; and that
Carminzym is an irrational mixture.</p>

<p>We hold that certain desirable therapeutic properties may rationally be attributable to
Carminzym; and that these are manifested in practice.</p>

<p>During the time since the description was sent and the receipt of the statement of the
action of the Council, some ten months, Carminzym has proved of constantly increasing service.</p></div>

<p>The statement in the letter of Fairchild Bros. and Foster “The long established
custom of the use of mixtures of remedial agents rests on considerations
well known and generally accepted” might well be paraphrased to read: The
one-time prevalent custom of using ill-considered combinations of remedial
agents has been thoroughly discredited and is generally abandoned by progressive
practitioners. Such arguments as that “laxatives, tonics, carminatives,
diuretics are combined with distinct advantage” have led to the use of irrational
mixtures such as the compound syrup of hypo­phosphites and the electuary of
theriaca. The Council is confident that no one who has studied the causes
and treatment of digestive disorders will find occasion to prescribe at one time
all the ingredients stated to be contained in Carminzym, and certainly not in
the fixed proportions present therein.</p>

<p>The comments in the Council’s report concerning ipecac certainly does
apply to all active therapeutic agents. Ipecac was mentioned in the report
because the several constituents of Carminzym were under discussion and hence
it was necessary to point out the futility of the small dosage of ipecac in
this mixture.</p>

<p>The announcement that “Carminzym has proved of constantly increasing
service” is not convincing. The Council does not know of a single clinical
study of the action of Carminzym under conditions which would have afforded
satisfactory evidence of its therapeutic value.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>PHILLIPS’ PHOSPHO-MURIATE OF QUININE COMP.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Comp. has
been adopted by the Council and authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Comp<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_125_131" id="FNanchor_125_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_131" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> is sold by the Charles H.
Phillips Chemical Co., New York. According to the published formula, each
fluidram contains:</p>

<tr><td class="tal" colspan="4">Flavoring, Glycerin and Syrup, <i>q. s.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Some typical claims made for the preparation are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With marked beneficial action upon the nervous system. To be relied on where a
deficiency of the phosphates is evident.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. brace those tired nerves and aid that worn stomach with Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate
of Quinine.”</p>

<p>“The maintenance of a satisfactory blood pressure level free from intervals of depression
may be accomplished by the use of Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Compound in appropriate
doses.”</p>

<p>“The quantities of quinin and strychnin in this preparation are so well balanced that they
relieve the depression and fatigue from mental or physical exertion, without the necessity of
recourse to alcoholic stimulation.”</p>

<p>“The other ingredients of Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine&mdash;phosphoric acid, and the
phosphates of potash, magnesia, lime, and iron&mdash;are the most rational as well as convenient
means of administering these tissue remedies, and of introducing phosphorus&mdash;the vitalizing
constituent of the nervous system&mdash;into the organism.”</p></div>

<p>The action of such a mixture as a whole is practically that of the sum of
the actions of its constituents. The therapeutic action of strychnin and quinin
are described in every text-book of therapeutics, but it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the various conditions in which these alkaloids have
been used without discrimination, and those conditions in which they have been
proved to be of value. While both have been widely used in a great variety
of conditions, neither is of proved value in more than a distinctly limited range
of diseases. The manufacturers of Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Comp.
seem to appeal to the less discriminating who use these alkaloids without any
definite conception of exactly what they seek to accomplish with them. Quinin,
although used by the uncritical in a host of diseases, has a definite field of
usefulness in the treatment of malaria, both prophylactic and curative, but the
required dose in the treatment of malaria is many times larger than that
recommended in the Phillips’ preparation. The claim that the “strychnin and
quinin in this preparation are so well balanced that they produce a mild,
<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>buoyant effect, so advantageous, instead of alcoholic stimulation, to relieve
depression and fatigue from mental or physical exertion” is nonsensical, if,
indeed, it is not mendacious balderdash.</p>

<p>Calcium and potassium have important functions in the body, but any
deficiency that may arise is usually attributable to an inability of the body to
utilize that which is supplied, for there is seldom any deficiency of these salts
in the food, and when they are needed they are best supplied as simple solutions
of the salts in appropriate doses without all of the other constituents of Phillips’
Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Comp.</p>

<p>Phosphoric acid exerts practically the same actions as other mineral acids,
hydrochloric being usually preferred for internal administration in certain forms
of indigestion, aside from which they are seldom used as such.</p>

<p>In the more recent literature for Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine
Comp., we find the attempt to utilize the well known craze about phosphorus,
which has been through so many phases, every one of which has had its day
and has been discarded.</p>

<p>The phosphoric acid and phosphates present in Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate
of Quinine are of no more value in nervous diseases than is simple sodium
phosphate which does not require the addition of a host of other ingredients
for its action. As a matter of fact, the phosphates of calcium and potassium
present in a dose of Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine are probably devoid
of appreciable effect in practically all conditions.</p>

<p>To pretend that one who suffers from physical and nervous exhaustion can
be materially benefited by this mixture is sheer nonsense and is unworthy of a
moment’s consideration by a clinician who is called on to treat such patients.</p>

<p>Iron is useful in anemia, as every one knows. Iron has practically no
other field of usefulness in therapeutics. When it is indicated it should be
administered in a simple form, such as the pill of ferrous carbonate, for example,
and not in a “shotgun” mixture that is quite as likely to do harm as good.</p>

<p>The claim that a satisfactory level of blood pressure can be maintained by
Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine is mentioned only to condemn as the
limit of impudent therapeutic claims. It is an insult to the intelligence of any
practitioner to pretend that any known agent or combination of remedial
agents can maintain a uniform blood pressure in any one of innumerable
conditions.</p>

<p>In short, Phillips’ Phospho-Muriate of Quinine Comp. is a complex and irrational
mixture exploited by means of unwarranted claims. It is a survival of
the old days of therapeutic chaos when impossible and fantastic chemical
formulas were gravely published and as solemnly accepted without question,
and also without the slightest understanding on the part of many; when the
most eminent of practitioners did not hesitate to give glowing testimonials for
lithia waters that contained no more lithium than ordinary river water; when
no therapeutic claim was too preposterous to receive acceptance, no theory too
nonsensical to justify the use of all manner of claptrap mixtures for all manner
of conditions.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 19, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>B. IODINE AND B. OLEUM IODINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on “B.
Iodine” and “B. Oleum Iodine,” together with the reply submitted by the
manufacturer and a discussion thereon by the referee in charge of the
preparations.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span></p>
<p>Specimens of B. Iodine and B. Oleum Iodine (B. Iodine Chemical Company)
and an advertising pamphlet were sent to the Council by John Bohlander,
A.M., M.D., with the declaration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Well knowing the value of Iodin in surgical operations and dressings, prompted me
for the benefit of my fellow physicians as well as myself, and for Humanity’s sake, to make
Iodin my master-piece in chemistry.</p>

<p>“After several years of diligent work in my private laboratory I succeeded in discovering
a new product of Iodin&mdash;Nitrogen, hydrate of Iodin.”</p></div>

<p>While “B. Iodine” is said to be nitrogen hydrate of iodin and “B. Oleum
Iodine” a 5 per cent. solution thereof, the examination made by Prof. A.&nbsp;H.
Clark of the University of Illinois, School of Pharmacy (working in the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory), indicates that the first is a simple mixture
of iodin and ammonium iodid, and the second a solution of iodin in liquid
petrolatum. The Council adopted the report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical
Laboratory (which appears below) and declared B. Iodine and B. Oleum Iodine
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because:</p>

<p>1. The composition is incorrectly declared. B. Iodine is not a newly discovered
iodin compound, “Nitrogen Hydrate of Iodine,” but a mixture of
iodin and ammonium iodid. B. Oleum Iodine is not a 5 per cent. solution of
B. Iodine as suggested by the statement on the label and in the advertising,
but a solution of iodin in liquid petrolatum containing about 0.85 per cent.
of iodin.</p>

<p>2. Since B. Iodine is a mixture of Iodin and ammonium iodid, its solution
in water will have the properties of other solutions of iodin made by the aid
of iodid, such as a dilution of tincture of iodin or of compound solution
of iodin (Lugol’s solution). Hence, the therapeutic claim that B. Iodine
“being of a colloidal nature has the advantage of being more readily absorbed
and taken up by all cellular structure, thus getting a perfect cellular medication
of Iodine,” is unwarranted.</p>

<p>3. The names “B. Iodine” and “B. Oleum Iodine” are not descriptive of
the pharmaceutical mixtures to which they are applied.</p>

<p>4. B. Iodine and B. Oleum Iodine are unessential modifications of established
articles. B. Iodine has no advantage over tincture of iodin or compound
solution of iodin. (As more convenient of transportation, the Medical Department
of the U.&nbsp;S. Army supplies its field hospitals with a mixture of iodin and
iodid ready for solution in water, either in tablet form or in powdered form
in tubes.) Solutions of iodin in liquid petrolatum may be readily prepared
(Reports Council Pharm. and Chem., 1917, p.&nbsp;88).</p>

<h3>B. IODINE PRODUCTS</h3>

<p class="author">A. H. Clark, Ph.G., B.S.</p>


<p>“B. Iodine” products are marketed by the B. Iodine Chemical Company,
Cincinnati, Ohio; John Bohlander, A.M., M.D., is said to be the discoverer.
They consist of “B. Iodine,” “B. Oleum Iodine,” and “B. Aqua Iodine.” B.
Iodine and B. Oleum Iodine were submitted to the Council.</p>

<p>In a circular submitted by the B. Iodine Chemical Company, B. Iodine is
said to be “Nitrogen Hydrate of Iodin.” It is claimed that “coming in contact
with water, H<sub>2</sub>O, a chemical change takes place forming Hydro Oxid of Iodin,
the Nitrogen of the Nitrogen Hydrate of Iodin escaping, the balance taking
up one of oxygen of the water. Its companion, the H<sub>2</sub>, escaping at the same
time with the Nitrogen then combining with the remainder of the water to
form the solution of Hydrogen Oxid of Iodin; so you can readily see that you
<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>really have a pure water of Iodin, nothing but the H, the O and the I.”&mdash;(<i>From
the Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 1, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h5>B. IODINE</h5>

<p>According to the circular, B. Iodine is soluble in alcohol, chloroform, and
ether. Also it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Has odor, taste, melting and boiling point, same as regular Iodin, has a great affinity for
water and will respond to all the tests of Iodin. Appears in a Bluish Black Granulated mass
or Powder. When heated in vaporating dish will throw off large purple volumes of Iodin
leaving a slight white crystalline precipitate, which on continuous heating will entirely disappear.
With careful manipulation you can get prismatic needle point like crystals, looking
like spores of glass, these dissolving in water will yield pure Iodin coloring the water Iodin.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Pharmacologic, Therapeutical and Physiological Action</span>: Same as Iodin, being of a
colloidal nature has the advantage of being more readily absorbed and taken up by all cellular
structure, thus getting a perfect cellular medication of Iodin.”</p></div>

<p>A sample of B. Iodine, marked “Nitrogen Hydrate of Iodin” was submitted
by the manufacturers and this sample was examined.</p>

<p>B. Iodine was found to be a granular powder, almost black with a purple
cast. It has an odor of iodin and dissolves in water readily. It is also quite
soluble in alcohol, but not entirely soluble in chloroform and ether. Ether
quickly dissolves iodin from B. Iodine, leaving a residue of a white granular
substance. Chloroform acts the same as ether except that the iodin is dissolved
out with some difficulty. On heating B. Iodine, vapors of iodin escape. If the
heating is done on a water bath, a residue of a white granular substance, subsequently
identified as ammonium iodid, remains. If heated in a bunsen flame,
no residue remains. These tests all indicate that iodin is held in the form of a
simple mixture.</p>

<p><i>Ammonia</i>: B. Iodine when mixed with an excess of sodium hydroxid and
warmed, evolves ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Iodine</i>: 0.1567&nbsp;gm. B. Iodine dissolved in water required 5.88&nbsp;c.c. tenth-normal
sodium thiosulphate solution indicating 48.28 per cent. iodin. 0.3721&nbsp;gm.
B. Iodine required 14.18&nbsp;c.c. tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate solution indicating
48.37 per cent. iodin. The average is 48.33 per cent. iodin.</p>

<p><i>Ammonium Iodide</i>: 0.3453&nbsp;gm. of the residue after heating B. Iodine on
a water bath until all iodin had volatilized was dissolved in water, acidulated
with phosphoric acid, and hydrogen dioxid solution added. The liberated iodin
was extracted with chloroform and titrated with tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate.
23.78&nbsp;c.c. were required indicating 0.3447&nbsp;gm., or 99.83 per cent.,
ammonium iodid.</p>

<p>A mixture of 5&nbsp;gm. iodin and 5&nbsp;gm. ammonium iodid has the properties of
B. Iodine mentioned above.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that B. Iodine is essentially a mixture of iodin and
ammonium iodid in equal parts, the two substances being finely powdered and
intimately mixed.</p>


<h5>B. OLEUM IODINE</h5>

<p>The following regarding B. Oleum Iodine is quoted from the circular submitted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“B. OLEUM IODINE: Iodine soluble in mineral oil 5 and 10% for Nasal, Pharyngeal,
Laryngeal, Bronchial, Rectal, etc., and all meucoid affections and abnormal conditions of the
mucous membrane.”</p></div>

<p>A sample of B. Oleum Iodine was submitted by the manufacturer and
examined. The label on the bottle states that it is 5 per cent. B. Oleum Iodine
in mineral oil. This sample has the characteristics of a solution of iodin in
liquid petrolatum. It is oily and has the characteristic violet color.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Ammonia</i>: B. Oleum Iodine, since it is presumed to be a solution of B. Iodine,
was examined for ammonium compounds. A small quantity was mixed with an
equal volume of strong sodium hydroxid solution and heated. No ammonia
was evolved. A few crystals of ammonium chlorid were added to a little of
B. Oleum Iodine and treated as above. Ammonia was readily detected.</p>

<p><i>Iodine</i>: 5.255&nbsp;gm. B. Oleum Iodine was dissolved in chloroform and placed
in a separator. A solution of potassium iodid was added and the iodin titrated
with a tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate solution. It required 3.5&nbsp;c.c. indicating
0.85 per cent. iodin.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that B. Oleum Iodine is a simple solution of iodin in
liquid petrolatum to the extent of 0.85 per cent. and not 5 per cent. as claimed.
Furthermore, it is not a solution of B. Iodine since no ammonium compound is
present.</p>

<p>The preceding report was sent to the B. Iodine Chemical Company. The
following reply was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your letter of the 21st inst., received and contents noted and cannot quite agree with your
report.</p>

<p>Reasons why: NH<sub>4</sub>I, a Nitro Hydrate Iodide; NH<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>, a Nitro Hydrate Iodate; and NH<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>,
Per Iodide, a molecular compound, which I claim, they all being of a NH group, so what can
be the objection of Nitrogen Hydrate of Iodine? Of course when your chemist, with the aid
of heat, drove off all the Iodine, he naturally brought it back to a NH<sub>4</sub>I. There’s where he
gets the A.M.. I claim a molecular compound.</p>

<p>The Oil of Iodine I sent you by mistake was a 1 per cent. and not a 5 per cent. as marked.
I claim it is made from the resublimed Iodine in mineral oil and not the B. Iodine. I claim a
5 per cent. has heretofore never been accomplished, so I therefore can claim something new.</p>

<p>Tr. Iodine contains Alcohol and Potash as a base, the alcohol a dehydrater and Potash an
escharotic, and all other soluble Iodines like the tincture have a metallic base. Mine has not.
My iodine is compatible almost with all the salts, alkaloids, tannates, and even the metals.
You can’t say that for the tincture or the others. Now why should mine not be superior to
others?</p>

<p>Preparations as yet are not on the market and a few pamphlets were printed to meet with
the requirements of your rulings and approval and shall be corrected if we only can agree on
a proper name as you may suggest.</p>

<p class="tac">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="tar"><span class="smcap pr2">The B. Iodine Chemical Co.</span><br />
By John Bohlander, A.M, M.D.</p>

<p>P.S. We are sending you under separate cover another sample of the Oil of Iodine which
is a 5 per cent. solution, and allowing for deterioration will test at least four per cent.</p></div>

<p>The referee in charge of the preparations submitted the above letter to the
Council with the following comments:</p>

<p>The principal statements in the letter are essentially erroneous or misleading:
Mixtures or double salts of ammonium iodid and iodin were not discovered
by Dr. Bohlander, and are nothing new. Watery solutions of iodin by means
of an iodid have long been known and used in the form of Lugol’s solution.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that ammonium iodid is less irritating than potassium
iodid. On the contrary, ammonium salts are generally more irritating than
the corresponding potassium salts. B. Iodine is not compatible with alkaloids,
but behaves essentially like Lugol’s solution. The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
reports that the new sample of B. Oleum Iodine contains only 1.2 per cent.
of free iodin, instead of the claimed amount. It is therefore somewhat weaker
than the iodin petrolatum prepared by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
(Reports Council Pharm. and Chem., 1917, p.&nbsp;88).</p>

<p>However good Dr. Bohlander’s intentions may be, the statements that he
makes about his products are misleading or erroneous, and the products are
ineligible for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>ANTITHYROID PREPARATIONS (ANTITHYROIDIN-MOEBIUS
AND THYREOIDECTIN) OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of antithyroid preparations (Antithyroidin-Moebius and Thyreoidectin)
has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, contains a discussion of “antithyroid”
preparation and describes two of these: Antithyroidin-Moebius (E. Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) and Thyreoidectin (Parke, Davis &amp; Company, Detroit,
Mich.).</p>

<p>The referee reported that these “antithyroid preparations” evidently have
not realized the expectations of their promoters, and are viewed with skepticism
by practically all critical clinicians.</p>

<p>Consequently, notwithstanding the cautiously worded statements of claims
made by the manufacturers of Thyreoidectin, the Council approved the recommendation
that this preparation (Thyreoidectin) be omitted from New and
Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rule 6 (unwarranted therapeutic claims)
and Rule 10 (unscientific and useless articles) (Antithyroidin-Moebius had
already been omitted because it was off the market). The Council further
directed that the general article “antithyroid preparations” be also omitted.</p>

<p>The Council having adopted the recommendation of the referee, Thyreoidectin
is omitted from N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., while the general article appears below, as a
matter of record:</p>

<p>Antithyroid preparations are obtained from the blood or milk of animals,
after the removal of the thyroid glands.</p>

<p>The use of these preparations is based on the theory that the thyroid gland
secretes products which are toxic, but which neutralize and are neutralized by,
other toxic substances produced elsewhere in the body. Removal of the thyroid
glands would then lead to the accumulation of these second toxic substances
as evidenced by the phenomena of cachexia strumipriva and myxedema. On
the other hand, the blood or milk of such animals is claimed to be capable of
preventing the effects of hypersecretion of thyroid substance, such as is supposed
to occur in hyperthyroidism (Basedow’s or Graves’ disease&mdash;generally
called exophthalmic goiter).</p>

<p>These views are largely hypothetical; attempts to give to them a rational
experimental basis have failed, but some clinical observers report distinctly
beneficial results in the milder forms of the diseases, and in obscure nervous
disorders which are supposedly connected with thyroid hypersecretion from the
administration of the milk from thyroidectomized goats and also from the use
of the proprietary blood preparations listed below. The value of these preparations
is very doubtful. The reported improvements may only be psychical or
due to associated measures, as is often seen in this disease. Other measures
of treatment should not be neglected.</p>

<p>Improvement is said to occur in two or three weeks and to be indicated by
an amelioration of the nervous symptoms, tremor, palpitation, insomnia and
excitability.</p>

<p>The administration must be long continued. Oral and hypodermic administration
are said to be equally effective, but the former is usually preferred.
These preparations are not known to be toxic, even when very large doses are
used.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;50.</i>)</p>

<h3>CEPHAELIN AND SYRUP CEPHAELIN-LILLY OMITTED
FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. AND SYRUP EMETIC-LILLY
NOT ACCEPTED</h3>

<h4>Report of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report, which
explains the omission of cephaelin and Syrup Cephaelin-Lilly from New and
Non­official Remedies and the non-acceptance of Syrup Emetic-Lilly.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, describes cephaelin (an alkaloid
obtained from ipecacuanha root) and lists Syrup Cephaelin-Lilly (containing
0.088&nbsp;Gm. cephaelin hydrochlorid per 100&nbsp;Cc.) as a pharmaceutical preparation
of it.</p>

<p>The period of acceptance for Syrup Cephaelin-Lilly having expired, Eli
Lilly &amp; Company were asked to send the current advertising and labels so
that the Council might determine if the acceptance of this preparation might be
continued. In reply the firm wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have changed the name Syrup Cephaeline to Syrup Emetic but the product remains
the same as before. We have no circulars describing Syrup Emetic and can only send copies
of the label.”</p></div>

<p>The new name “Syrup Emetic” conflicts with the rules of the Council in
that it does not indicate the potent ingredient of this simple pharmaceutical
preparation and in that it is thera­peutically suggestive. Emetics are powerful
agents, and physicians should be given every opportunity of knowing what
they prescribe for the purpose.</p>

<p>The name being in conflict with Rule 8, the Council voted to omit Syrup
Cephaelin-Lilly and not to accept Syrup Emetic-Lilly.</p>

<p>As the cephaelin syrup was the only preparation of cephaelin admitted to
New and Non­official Remedies, and as the alkaloid appears to have no important
therapeutic field, the Council directed that the description of cephaelin
also be omitted.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>COLALIN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of Colalin has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Colalin is a bile salt preparation claimed to consist essentially of hyoglycocholic
and hyotaurocholic acids. It is manufactured by Rufus Crowell and
Company, Somerville, Mass., and marketed by Schieffelin and Company, New
York.</p>

<p>An examination of the current advertising by the referee of the Council
in charge of bile salt preparations having revealed that claims were made for
Colalin which were not in harmony with the known action of bile preparations,
Schieffelin and Company were informed that in the opinion of the referee the
Colalin circular matter required radical revision. In this communication the
referee’s objections to the claims were set forth in detail.</p>

<p>No reply to this letter was received, and hence a copy of the letter was
sent to Schieffelin and Company and also to Rufus Crowell and Company with
the explanation that unless the statements in the Colalin advertising which
the referee had questioned were substantiated by satisfactory evidence, were
<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>suitably revised, or else the advertising matter withdrawn pending revision, the
referee would be obliged to recommend to the Council that Colalin be omitted
from New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>In reply, Schieffelin and Company wrote that they were not “engaged
actively in the introduction of Colalin,” and agreed to the omission of Colalin
from N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>In view of the failure to substantiate the claims objected to or an agreement
to discontinue them, the Council directed that Colalin and Colalin Tablets
be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rule 6
(unwarranted therapeutic claims).</p>

<p>The following are the claims which the referee questioned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Colalin embodies the physiological function of the bile in the intestinal canal and also
possesses properties of its own which are intimately connected with the function of the liver.”</p></div>

<p>The quotation implies that Colalin has properties essentially different from
those of bile salts, a claim which requires substantiation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the liver its action seems to be that of a general stimulant of all the hepatic functions.”</p></div>

<p>This is a claim which requires substantiation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By the introduction of Colalin it has therefore become possible to actually utilize the bile
for therapeutic purposes.”</p></div>

<p>This is an unwarranted claim, for bile was used thera­peutically before
Colalin was introduced.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As gall-stones are chiefly composed of cholesterin, experiments were made to determine
whether Colalin would dissolve these concretions outside of the body. These were completely
successful and were then followed by an extensive series of clinical investigations on persons
suffering with cholelithiasis, which demonstrated that by the administration of Colalin in many
instances gall-stones were evacuated by the natural passages and their further formation prevented
without resort to surgical intervention.”</p></div>

<p>This is misleading in that the context shows that “without surgical intervention”
is meant to imply a connection between the experiments showing the
solvent power of Colalin and the passage of concretions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Colalin not only acts as a solvent of cholesterin calculi, but prevents their further
formation by removing the causes upon which their development depends.”</p></div>

<p>This conveys the impression that such solvent action is exerted in the body,
that is, that such concretions in the gallbladder may be dissolved and evacuated
by the use of Colalin. For this claim there is no evidence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To understand the value of Colalin in intestinal disorders it is necessary to bear in mind
the important functions of the bile in the intestinal canal, namely, its participation in the
digestion of fats, its antitoxic action, and its influence upon the peristalsis.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. through its antiseptic influence inhibits the production of toxins in the intestines.”</p></div>

<p>The referee believes that there is no satisfactory evidence that bile or bile
salts can inhibit the production of toxins in that part of the intestine&mdash;the
colon&mdash;in which they are commonly produced.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;52.</i>)</p>

<h3>FORAL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report on Foral, a depilatory preparation, has been authorized
for publication by the Council.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span></p>
<p>Foral is sold by the Foral Products Company, Pittsburgh, Pa., as an
“antiseptic depilatory” with the special claim for its use for the removal of
hair prior to surgical operation or the dressing of wounds. In addition to
claims made for its hair dissolving action, it is asserted that, in removing the
hair from an open wound, Foral acts as “an antiseptic, which guarantees
against any infection.” It is also claimed that, though hair will return after
its use, “by proper use it will diminish the growth of hair and cause the hair
to grow much slower, and unlike the razor, the hair will not return coarser
and thicker.”</p>

<p>We are informed by the Foral Products Company that their preparation is
used in many hospitals and that “<span class="ell">..</span>. one and all are well pleased and a
great satisfaction to do away with the old style razor&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>Foral is stated to be made according to the following formula:</p>

<p class="tac fs85"><i>To manufacture seventy-five pounds of FORAL</i></p>

</table></div>

<p class="ml2em fs85">The four above chemicals are going to a heating process before mixing or sifting.</p>

<p>In consideration of the preceding, the Council declared Foral inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with its rules, thus:</p>

<p>1. Foral is an unessential and irrational modification of an established
article.</p>

<p>While its manufacturer states that Foral has been on the market for eighteen
years, the following depilatory formula appears in a book published thirty-five
years ago (A practical Treatise on Diseases of the Skin, Louis A. Duhring,
Ed.&nbsp;3, 1883) and is to be found in most books on dermatology:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Barium Sulphid</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">2&nbsp;drams</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Zinc oxid</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">3&nbsp;drams</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Starch</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">3&nbsp;drams</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Permanganates and sulphids mutually destroy each other, and therefore the
addition of the small amount of potassium permanganate cannot serve any
useful purpose. The amounts of phenol, menthol and “Lilac or Citronel oil”
are too small to exercise any effect (other than that of a flavor) and must be
considered unessential additions.</p>

<p>2. Foral is a pharmaceutical mixture marketed under a non-informing name.</p>

<p>Whereas it is in the interest of rational medicine that physicians should
know the composition of the preparations which they use, the name of this
pharmaceutical mixture fails to indicate that it contains the well-known and
by no means always harmless barium sulphid.</p>

<p>3. Foral is sold under exaggerated and unwarranted claims.</p>

<p>In view of the small amount of phenol present and the method of using the
preparation, the claim that the use of Foral which, when operating on open
wounds, “guarantees against any infection,” is evidently unwarranted.</p>

<p>There is no evidence for the claim that the use of depilatories such as Foral
retards the growth of hair or renders hair less coarse. On the contrary, the
commonly prevailing opinion is that depilation, like shaving, makes the hair
coarser.</p>

<p>To determine if “one and all” of those who had used Foral were still using
the preparation, four of the testimonials, appearing in an advertising pamphlet,
<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>were investigated. The pharmacist of the hospital from which the first of these
testimonials was stated to have emanated replied that the person whose name
appeared in connection with it had left the hospital about ten years ago and
that no depilatory preparation has been used in this hospital for some time.
So far as he knew, depilatories were not now in use in the surgical wards of
the hospital. In regard to the second testimonial, the pharmacist of this
hospital wrote that the hospital had not bought the preparation, but that some
of it had been obtained for an elderly deaconness, who had personal use for a
depilatory. The physician signing the third testimonial replied that the
preparation was effectual for the removal of hair from the scalp, but that
“<span class="ell">..</span>. we have gotten out of the habit of using it.” In the case of the
fourth testimonial, its asserted author wrote “<span class="ell">..</span>. if it is applied in too large
a quantity or too concentrated, or permitted to remain on too long, it will vesicate.
It was for this reason chiefly that I discontinued its use. It is a very
bad smelling mixture and patients complain of it very bitterly.”&mdash;(<i>From Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;55.</i>)</p>

<h3>GRANULAR EFFERVESCENT BROMIDE AND ACETANILID
COMPOUND-MULFORD</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of Granular Effervescent Bromide and Acetanilid Compound-Mulford
has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Council holds that complex mixtures of remedial agents are from every
point of view inimical to therapeutic progress and therefore to the public welfare.
They are especially objectionable because it is impossible accurately to
determine the effects which follow the simultaneous administration of a number
of drugs having dissimilar actions, and because the practice of prescribing
such mixtures tends to discourage careful consideration of the special needs
of the individual patients without which there can be no drug therapy. On
the contrary, with the use of such mixtures, therapeutic treatment becomes
haphazard and mere guesswork.</p>

<p>The Council, appreciating that long established customs cannot be changed
at once, has applied Rule 10, concerning the recognition of mixtures, with the
greatest leniency compatible with consistency. When there has been a reasonable
doubt concerning the value of a mixture, it has frequently directed that
Rule 10 should not apply, pending further clinical trial of such mixture.</p>

<p>In no instance has subsequent experience shown that a strict interpretation
of the rule would have worked hardship or injustice. The Council feels that
there is no longer warrant for the admission of complex mixtures to New and
Non­official Remedies, or for the retention of any that have been admitted, unless
definite evidence of the therapeutic value of such combinations is available. In
accordance with this decision, several mixtures now described in New and Non­official
Remedies will be omitted at the expiration of the three year period
for which articles are accepted.</p>

<p>Granular Effervescent Bromide and Acetanilid Compound-Mulford is listed
in the Appendix to New and Non­official Remedies. Each 100&nbsp;Gm. of the
mixture contains sodium bromide, 5&nbsp;Gm., and acetanilid, 1.5&nbsp;Gm. According
to the label, an amount containing acetanilid, 6.5 grains, and sodium bromide,
22 grains, is to be taken at a dose, to be repeated in half an hour if necessary.
For “children,” half this dose is advised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span></p>
<p>The Council has considered the available evidence for mixtures of this sort,
and has reached the conclusion that they are inimical to rational medicine and
the public, and therefore in conflict with Rule 10. It holds that the use of
mixtures of acetanilid and sodium bromide in fixed proportion is irrational
and prone to induce their indiscriminate use by the public. Despite the perfectly
frank declaration of the composition of this mixture that is made by the
Mulford Company, the “directions” will be followed blindly and the preparation
will be given to “children” and “repeated in half an hour, if necessary”
in cases in which it would be held unwarranted to administer a dose of 3
grains of acetanilid to a child.</p>

<p>The period of acceptance having expired for Granular Effervescent Bromide
and Acetanilid Compound-Mulford, the Council directed its omission from New
and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rule 10.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>To explain the omission from New and Non­official Remedies of certain
mixtures, the Council has authorized publication of the matter which appears
below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Council holds that complex mixtures of remedial agents are from every
point of view inimical to therapeutic progress and therefore to the public
welfare. They are especially objectionable because it is impossible accurately
to determine the effects which follow the simultaneous administration of a
number of drugs having dissimilar actions, and because the practice of prescribing
such mixtures tends to discourage careful consideration of the special
needs of individual patients without which there can be no rational drug

becomes haphazard and mere guesswork.</p>

<p>The Council, appreciating that long established customs cannot be changed

greatest leniency compatible with consistency. When there has been a reasonable
doubt concerning the value of a mixture it has frequently directed that
Rule 10 should not apply, pending further clinical trial of such mixture.</p>

<p>In no instance has subsequent experience shown that a strict interpretation
of the rule would have worked hardship or injustice. The Council feels that
there is no longer any warrant for the admission of complex mixtures to New
and Non­official Remedies or for the retention of any that have been admitted
unless definite evidence of the therapeutic value of such combinations is available.
In accordance with this decision, several mixtures now described in New
and Non­official Remedies will be omitted as soon as the three year period for
which articles are accepted has expired.</p>

<p>The following preparations are included in New and Non­official Remedies,
1918:</p>

<p>Holadin and Bile Salts-Fairchild.&mdash;A mixture of holadin, 5 parts, with bile
salts-Fairchild, 1 part, put up in 3 grain capsules.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span></p>
<p>Capsules of Bile Salts, Succinate of Soda and Phenol­phthalein.&mdash;Each capsule
contains bile salts-Fairchild, 0.065&nbsp;Gm. (1 grain); sodium succinate exsiccated,
0.2&nbsp;Gm. (3 grains), and phenol­phthalein, 0.03&nbsp;Gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain).</p>

<p>Capsules of Holadin, Bile Salts and Phenol­phthalein.&mdash;Each capsule contains
holadin, 0.13&nbsp;Gm. (2 grains); bile salts-Fairchild, 0.03&nbsp;Gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain),
and phenol­phthalein, 0.065&nbsp;Gm. (1 grain).</p>

<p>Capsules of Holadin, Succinate of Soda and Bile Salts.&mdash;Each capsule
contains holadin, 0.20&nbsp;Gm. (3 grains); sodium succinate exsiccated, 0.20&nbsp;Gm.
(3 grains), and bile salts-Fairchild, 0.03&nbsp;Gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain).</p>

<p>Oxbile has long been credited with a cholagogue action, which, however, has
probably been greatly overestimated. When pure bile salts were placed on
the market some years ago, they and their compounds were admitted to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>Holadin is said to represent all the constituents of the pancreas and to
possess great potency in respect to the several enzymes, trypsin, amylopsin,
lipase, and the milk-curdling ferment.</p>

<p>It is not clear when such a substance is indicated thera­peutically. While
it may be useful when there is a deficiency of pancreatin and gastric secretion,
it should be used alone.</p>

<p>It is also quite possible that bile salts may have a distinct, though limited,
field of usefulness when there is a deficiency of biliary secretion; but the bile
salts are best administered alone, or in combination with such laxatives as may
be deemed necessary by the physician while keeping in mind the fact that
different patients show the widest difference in their reaction to laxatives,
making combinations of these agents in fixed proportion irrational.</p>

<p>Phenol­phthalein was popularized by nostrum makers; and while it has some
therapeutic value, this has been greatly overestimated, and it should be used
only in amounts deemed necessary for each patient, preferably alone.</p>

<p>Succinate of sodium was introduced as a saline cathartic, with the claim
that it exerts an antiseptic action on the biliary passages and gallbladder. There
is no satisfactory evidence to substantiate this claim.</p>

<p>The Council maintains a liberal attitude toward new preparations, but it
feels that it is impossible to determine the value of the several constituents
of such complex mixtures when used as such; it holds that these mixtures
are superfluous and that the several substances of which they are composed
should be used singly or at most with greater attention to the individual requirements
of the patient than is possible when these fixed mixtures are prescribed.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that these mixtures have been in use for more than nine
years, there is no satisfactory evidence that they possess any advantage over
the simple laxatives or the preparations of bile or pancreatic extract. They
are therefore held to be in conflict with Rule 10, and the Council has directed
that they be not included in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. after Dec. 31, 1918.</p>

<p>Having adopted the preceding report, the Council, in accordance with its
regular procedure, submitted this to Fairchild Bros. and Foster for comment.</p>

<p>The following reply was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are entirely at variance with you in the arbitrary conclusion expressed concerning the
inimical influence of mixtures on therapeutic progress, the practice of medicine and the public
welfare.</p>

<p>If the combinations of Holadin and Bile Salts, etc., in capsules, were ever properly within
the scope of New and Non­official Remedies, they should be retained. If, however, complex
mixtures are to be held as, a priori, unworthy of consideration, the rejection of all would
naturally be a logical proceeding.</p>

<p>We believe that the particular combination of Holadin and Bile Salts etc., have been clearly
in the line of therapeutic progress&mdash;a natural evolution, improvement and development.</p>

<p>For many years combinations of pancreatic extract and ox gall had naturally suggested
themselves.</p>

<p>When we realized the fact that the bile salts were quite clearly the active principles of the
bile, and that they must necessarily exist in greatly varying percentages in the official inspissated
or ox gall, and also because these ox gall products of pharmacy were of extremely
<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>varying density, even from that of treacle to resin&mdash;and of other objectionable character, we
undertook to prepare bile salts.</p>

<p>These combinations are now further justified in view of physiological considerations, the
simultaneous secretion of the pancreas and bile, and the state of our knowledge of the function
of bile salts, and as co-ferments, promoting and supplementing the pancreas enzymes.</p>

<p>The question suggested as to whether the cholagogic action of ox gall (and bile salts) has
been overestimated seems to us no clear purport. The bile salts are obviously employed as
the means of administering and thus realizing whatever properties this secretion may have in
medicine, of which the cholagogic action is by no means the only consideration.</p>

<p>As for phenol­phthalein, which is credited with purely laxative properties, we are at a loss
to see any bearing in the remark that phenol­phthalein was popularized by nostrum makers.
We cannot see that the physician’s or chemist’s estimate of phenol­phthalein, its properties
and uses, can be in the least degree influenced one way or the other by the statement that
“phenol­phthalein has been popularized by nostrum makers.”</p>

<p>The phenol­phthalein and succinate of soda combinations were originally both prescribed,
and we have simply placed them at the service of the physician without other exploitation of
them than that designed to call attention to their use in the conditions indicated.</p>

<p>These combinations are offered in a form which may be administered by the mouth with the
best promise of introducing the substance more directly in the intestinal tract during the
digestion period or at such interval after or prior to, the digestion period, as would best, in the
judgment of the physician, meet the indications.</p>

<p>These particular combinations are especially desirable in these “fixed forms” since they
are stable and reliable resources at the command of the physicians, the enzymes retaining their
stability and potency without material deterioration for many years, and they naturally possess
the advantages which are obviously due to the character of the particular pancreas and bile
products used in the combinations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hygroscopic and soluble organic substances in admixture cannot ex­tem­por­aneously
be so prepared in sealed capsules as to be readily available under the practical
requirements of prescribing and dispensing. And we do not believe that those who practice
medicine will be in accord with your view that the pancreas substance should necessarily be
administered alone, or the bile substance alone.</p>

<p>It now appears that these combinations are to be dropped from New and Non­official Remedies
in consequence of the view, so stated, that in clinical experience “for more than nine
years there is no satisfactory evidence that they possess any advantage over the simple laxatives
or preparations of bile or pancreatic extract.”</p>

<p>In reply to this we would simply make the following comment:</p>

<p>During these “nine years” these combinations have inevitably been put to an informing
clinical trial, because of the fact that they have been employed with success in disorders of
the pancreas and bile functions and often in chronic and serious cases where the clinical
conditions were obvious and unmistakable.</p>

<p>The reports of these cases come to us from physicians widely separated and each of his own
independent initiative. It would seem gratuitous, to say the least, to state that the observers
are “disinterested,” since it is quite clear that there is no other interest than that of the practitioner
and his patient.</p>

<p>It is not a case of a new drug or combinations of new remedies, but simply resources
which, upon well grounded reasons, both from a theoretical and material standpoint, justify
clinical trial, and with results which would seem from any ordinary human standpoint to be
satisfactory clinical evidence.</p>

<p>As to the interpretation of competent clinical evidence by the Council, we would, in view
of the circumstances and without comment, ask to embody in this text this rule:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs100">

<p>“Clinical Evidence.”&mdash;“To be acceptable, the clinical evidence must offer objective data
with such citation of authority as will enable the Council to confirm the facts and establish
the scientific value of the conclusions drawn. Clinical data are worthless when the author
is not cited. The facts on which claims with regard to the value of a remedy are based
must have been rendered accessible for investigation and confirmation by disinterested
observers, either through publication or through the records of a hospital or other institution.”</p></div>

<p>To discredit these combinations would seem to us not only unjustified, but sterile of any
real advancement in medicine, or of anything in the way of helpfulness to the patient in the
class of cases in which these products have been resorted to with benefit; this on no other
ground really than the opinion “that they have no advantage over the simple preparations
themselves.”</p>

<p>Naturally we shall continue to prepare these products and shall continue to take such
action as we deem best to bring them to the attention of the physician, for the conduct of our
business must remain in the hands of those who are personally responsible for it.</p>

<p>And it is now forty years since we took up this line of work and with the declared intention
of devoting ourselves to the applied science of the digestive ferments and “to their development
and practical application in every useful purpose in medicine.”</p>

<p>We have been consistently in sympathy with the fundamental purpose of the Council, which
must first rest upon fact as to the character of the products offered as medicinal agents. The
<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>weight of evidence justifies the position that these particular products rationally should be,
and as a matter of fact are, of important special service in the utilization of these organic
secretions in medicine.</p></div>

<p>As explained in the preceding report, the Council holds that complex mixtures
of remedial agents are from every point of view inimical to therapeutic progress
and therefore to the public welfare. They are especially objectionable because
it is impossible to determine accurately the effects which follow the simultaneous
administration of a number of drugs having dissimilar actions, and because
such a practice tends strongly to discourage careful consideration of the special
needs of individual patients without which there can be no therapeutic progress.
On the contrary, with their use, therapeutic treatment becomes haphazard and
mere guesswork.</p>

<p>The dismissal of the holadin and bile salts mixtures does not involve the
question of the usefulness of holadin or of bile salts alone; on the contrary,
the possible usefulness of these preparations is admitted in the report. It is
the combination of holadin, bile salts, sodium succinate and phenol­phthalein
to which objection is made.</p>

<p>The statement of Fairchild Bros. and Foster that “these combinations are
now further justified in view of physiological considerations” is somewhat
misleading. It is true that bile and the pancreatic secretion cooperate in
intestinal digestion, but there is no evidence that in every case in which there
is a deficiency of one of these secretions there is also a deficiency of the other,
and it is an axiom of scientific therapeutics that no drug or remedial agent
should be administered except to fill a definite want. Otherwise the practice
of therapeutics becomes mere empiricism.</p>

<p>The properties of phenol­phthalein are not in the least influenced by the
manner of its introduction, as Messrs. Fairchild Bros. and Foster emphasize;
but the important fact in this connection is that the popular conception of their
actions is greatly influenced by the mode of introduction, and phenol­phthalein
has been widely advertised in a variety of conditions, so that the popular
notion concerning it is not that of scientific therapeutics.</p>

<p>In short, the entire argument of Messrs. Fairchild Bros. and Foster concerning
the exploitation of these preparations may be summed up by saying
that they have been used by clinicians who believe that good results have
followed their use, and that the firm will therefore continue to supply the
demand. The tendency of some to use anything brought to their notice, and
the readiness of manufacturers to market anything that physicians will use,
presents the greatest obstacle to therapeutic progress. There was never a
nostrum so irrational or worthless that honest but undiscriminating clinicians
could not be found who reported wonderful results from its use.</p>

<p>According to Fairchild Bros. and Foster, these holadin and bile salts
mixtures have been in use for some nine years. Yet the Council is not aware
of any investigation of their merits that meets the requirements of scientific
research.</p>

<p>The Council is not acquainted with a single clinical investigation of their
action under conditions which afford satisfactory evidence of their therapeutic
value.</p>

<p>It is obviously wholly insufficient for a clinician to report that the use of a
mixture was followed by good results. The fallacy of such arguments was
demonstrated long ago. He must make a comparison of the results obtained
with the remedial agent with those obtained in as nearly similar conditions as
possible except for the use of the agent. We are not aware that any such
study of the mixtures in question has been made. It is in the last degree
irrational to hold that because bile salts are the active constituents of bile,
therefore such complex mixtures as these are necessary.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of

<h3>LIQUOR SANTAIVA, S. &amp; D., OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of Liquor Santaiva, S. &amp; D., has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>So far the Council has applied Rule 10 concerning the recognition of mixtures
with the greatest leniency compatible with consistency. When there
has been a reasonable doubt concerning the value of a mixture, it has frequently
directed that Rule 10 should not apply, pending further clinical trial of such
mixture.</p>

<p>In no instance has subsequent experience shown that a strict interpretation
of the rule would have worked hardship or injustice. The Council feels that
there is no longer any warrant for the admission of complex mixtures to
New and Non­official Remedies or for the retention of any that have been
admitted, unless definite evidence of the therapeutic value of such combinations
is available.</p>

<p>The Council being engaged in the annual revision of New and Non­official
Remedies, the referee in charge of santal preparations reported that the three
year period of acceptance had expired for Liquor Santaiva (Sharp &amp; Dohme).</p>

<p>The referee held that Liquor Santaiva, S. &amp; D., declared to be a solution
of santal oil and copaiba with aromatic oils, in a mixture of alcohol and water,
is plainly in conflict with the current interpretation of Rule 10, because there
was no sound evidence to indicate that any useful end is gained by the simultaneous
administration of santal oil and copaiba in any proportion, and that
so, of course, there is no evidence of the special advantage in the fixed proportions
represented by the mixture. He pointed out that the formula is
essentially a survival of the discredited shotgun gonorrhea mixtures and therefore
recommended that its acceptance be not continued.</p>

<p>The Council agreed to the recommendation of the referee and directed that
Liquor Santaiva, S. &amp; D., be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>MALTZYME, MALTZYME WITH CASCARA SAGRADA, MALTZYME
WITH COD LIVER OIL, MALTZYME FERRATED
AND MALTZYME WITH YERBA SANTA
OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of the Maltzyme preparations has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>In 1916, the Council voted to omit Maltzyme with Hypo­phosphites, and
Maltzyme with Phosphate of Iron, Quinine and Strychnine. At that time the
labels used on the Maltzyme preparations still in New and Non­official Remedies
contained a list of Maltzyme combinations which included those which had
been dismissed. As the Council does not permit an accepted article to be
used as a means of advertising an article not accepted, it voted to continue
the following preparations for a period of three years on condition that
reference to the deleted articles be omitted from the labels when those then
<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>in stock had been used up: Maltzyme, Maltzyme with Cascara Sagrada, Maltzyme
with Cod Liver Oil, Maltzyme Ferrated and Maltzyme with Yerba Santa.
While the Maltzyme Company made no definite agreement to revise its advertising
propaganda in accordance with the Council’s requirements, the Maltzyme
preparations were retained in the belief that in due time the required revision
of the labels would be made.</p>

<p>The Council being engaged in preparing the 1919 edition of New and Non­official
Remedies, the referee in charge of malt extracts reported that the
Maltzyme Company had not revised its labels in accordance with the stipulation
of the Council. The referee further reported he had become convinced that
the claim that Maltzyme is “rich in malt enzymes” is unwarranted and that
the term “Maltzyme” (malt plus enzyme) is misleading; this because of the
recognized instability of malt extracts (Jour. A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 30, 1912, p.&nbsp;954)
and because the Maltzyme Company makes no definite statement with regard
to the diastase (malt enzyme) content of its preparations<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_126_132" id="FNanchor_126_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_132" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> For this reason
it had been the referee’s intention to propose the deletion of all Maltzyme
preparations when their period of acceptance expired in 1919. As, however,
the present Maltzyme preparations are in contravention with the Council’s
requirements, he recommended that the acceptance of these preparations be
canceled now.</p>

<p>The Council agreed to the recommendation of the referee and directed that
Maltzyme, Maltzyme with Cascara Sagrada, Maltzyme with Cod Liver Oil,
Maltzyme Ferrated, and Maltzyme with Yerba Santa be omitted from N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>METHAFORM OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of Methaform has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Methaform is the proprietary name applied by F. Stearns &amp; Co. to chlorbutanol.</p>

<p>Being engaged in the annual revision of New and Non­official Remedies, and
the term of acceptance for Methaform having expired, a trade package was
purchased to determine if the product was marketed in compliance with the
rules of the Council. It was then found that a circular was wrapped with
the trade package which advertised Methaform Inhalant, a preparation not
accepted for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, the Council does not countenance the use of an accepted
article as a means of advertising an article not accepted. Accordingly F. Stearns
&amp; Co. was advised that the Council would be obliged to withdraw the acceptance
of Methaform unless the objectionable circular was omitted from the Methaform
packages. Stearns &amp; Co. did not give the requested assurance, and therefore
the Council directed that Methaform be omitted from New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;68</i>)</p>

<h3>PINEAL GLAND, RED BONE-MARROW AND THYMUS GLAND
AND THEIR PREPARATIONS OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of pineal gland, red bone-marrow and thymus gland and their preparations
has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Pineal gland, red bone-marrow and thymus gland were admitted to New
and Non­official Remedies when these products gave promise of having therapeutic
value.</p>

<p>The term of acceptance for the preparations of pineal gland, red bone-marrow
and thymus gland having expired, the referee in charge of animal
organ preparations recommended in his report for the annual revision of
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. that these products and the general articles describing them be
omitted from New and Non­official Remedies. He held that the experimental
and clinical experience with them leads to the conclusion that they are without
value.</p>

<p>In accordance with the recommendation of the referee, the Council voted
that the following preparations be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies:
Desiccated Pineal Gland-Armour; Pineal Gland Tablets-Armour; Extract of
Red Bone-Marrow-Armour; Desiccated Thymus-Armour; Thymus Tablets-Armour.</p>

<p>As a matter of record, the descriptive articles for pineal gland, red bone-marrow
and thymus gland, which appeared in New and Non­official Remedies,
1918, are given below.</p>


<h4>Pineal Gland</h4>

<p>The functions of this gland have not yet been established but there is some
pathological and some experimental evidence that there is a relation between
the gland and some processes of development and growth; the nature of this
relation is unknown. Adiposis is a frequent sign of disturbed pineal function,
but observers are not agreed whether to interpret this as indicating hypofunction
or hyperfunction, or possibly a concurrent disturbance of the pituitary. In
some instances intravenous injections of pineal extract have seemed to cause
a distinct fall in blood pressure. It has been inferred from observations in
cases of pineal tumors in the young that the gland in young individuals furnishes
a secretion which inhibits growth, particularly the development of the
reproductive glands, but the results of experimental administration of pineal
substance orally have led other observers to infer that the pineal secretion
favors physical and possibly mental and sexual development. It has been
suggested that, as all evidence points to the fact that the function of the
pineal gland is one of early life, extract of adult pineal glands might be
expected to be inert. Experiment has also indicated greater activity in glands
obtained from young animals than in those obtained from older ones. The
Council has decided to admit preparations of pineal gland to New and Non­official
Remedies simply for experimental purposes.</p>


<h4>Red Bone-Marrow</h4>

<p>Red bone-marrow consists largely (more than 90 per cent.) of fat. In
new-born animals a third or more of this fat consists of lecithin. The marrow
of the bones of new-born animals contains iron (up to 1 per cent. or more)
in various forms of organic combination. Both lecithin and iron decrease
rapidly in the first weeks after birth. The commercial preparations contain
very variable amounts of these constituents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Actions and Uses.</i>&mdash;Red bone-marrow is supposed to stimulate the formation
of red blood corpuscles; whatever action it may have in this direction is
probably due largely to the iron and lecithin which it contains.</p>

<p>It is said to be useful in simple and pernicious anemias.</p>


<h4>Thymus Gland</h4>

<p>Little is known as to the functions of the thymus, but it is believed to have
an important relation to growth. There also seems to be some relation between
the thymus and thyroid, for the former is frequently abnormal in diseases
involving the latter (hyperthyroidism).</p>

<p>The use of thymus is purely empirical. It has been employed in the treatment
of hyperthyroidism, rickets, tuberculosis, hemophilia, and infantile marasmus
and atrophy; its use in the latter conditions is said to be the most
promising. It is claimed on very doubtful grounds to exert a somewhat
favorable effect in certain cases of cancer.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;69</i>)</p>

<h3>PIPERAZINE AND LYCETOL OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The following report explaining the omission from New and Non­official
Remedies of Piperazine and Lycetol has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Piperazine (diethylenediamene) and Lycetol (a methyl derivative of diethylenediamene)
were accepted for New and Non­official Remedies in 1906. Both
Piperazine and Lycetol were asserted to be efficient uric acid solvents and
efficacious remedies in the treatment of gout and rheumatism. These products
have been retained until now because there was no investigation which definitely
showed their uselessness as uric acid solvents, though their use is generally
admitted to have been disappointing.</p>

<p>From an exhaustive and critical study of the available evidence, Hanzlik
(Jour. Lab. &amp; Clin. Med., February, 1917) concluded that scientific evidence,
though limited, and clinical opinion indicate that Piperazine is valueless in
gout and that there is sufficient scientific evidence to indicate the worthlessness
of Lycetol.</p>

<p>The referee in charge of Piperazine and Lycetol recommended that these
products be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies for the reason that
they have been sufficiently tried to justify the conclusion that they are not of
value. The period of acceptance having expired, the Council directed that
Piperazine and Piperazine Tablets (The Bayer Company, Inc.) and Lycetol
(The Bayer Company, Inc.) be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;70.</i>)</p>

<h3>STANOLIND LIQUID PARAFFIN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>As explained in the report which follows, “Stanolind Liquid Paraffin” was
omitted from New and Non­official Remedies at the request of the proprietors.
Announcement of this omission was made in the preface to New and Non­official
Remedies, 1918, but publication of the Council’s report was postponed
pending actual conflict with the rules. The Council now authorizes publication
<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>of the report because a circular indirectly advertising the product to the public
was found enclosed with the trade package of Stanolind Liquid Paraffin.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Stanolind Liquid Paraffin was admitted to New and Non­official Remedies
in 1916, when its method of marketing conformed to the rules of the Council.
This brand of liquid petrolatum, by action of the Council, has been omitted
from New and Non­official Remedies on request of the Standard Oil Company
of Indiana, its manufacturer, who wrote to the Secretary of the Council
stating that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In order that our facilities for the manufacture of this oil shall be constantly engaged, it
will be necessary for us to find sales on a larger scale than in the past. To do this under our
present advertising and marketing arrangement we feel will be impossible.”</p></div>

<p>This letter, in addition, suggested “that physicians are not prescribing
Stanolind Liquid Paraffin in any considerable proportion of their orders” and
“that the situation which now confronts us would not be materially helped if
Stanolind was specified in all such prescriptions.” Further, the Council is
asked to consider whether it “might be willing to declare this preparation as
not a Council product,” on the alleged grounds that “liquid paraffin is not
medicinal in its action and passes through the digestive tract in practically
unaltered condition.”</p>

<p>The Council holds that Stanolind Liquid Paraffin is a drug, and that,
therefore, its direct advertising to the public is in contravention of the Council’s
rules. Constipation should be treated by dietary and hygienic means. Evacuants
are only temporary measures. Liquid petrolatum is medicinal; it greatly
modifies the intestinal flora; it acts as a lubricant and emollient; it modifies
the absorptive powers of the intestinal mucous membrane; it is capable of
influencing the digestion of fats. In short, liquid petrolatum, being a drug,
its indiscriminate and excessive use should not be encouraged.&mdash;(<i>From Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;72</i>)</p>

<h3>WESTERFIELD’S DIGITALIS TABLETS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following report and authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Westerfield’s Digitalis Tablets (The Westerfield Pharmacal Co., Dayton,
Ohio) are claimed to represent a fat free tincture of digitalis and to be “enteric
coated.” It is claimed that because of this coating these tablets pass the
stomach unchanged and dissolve in the intestine, and that this obviates any
possibility of gastric disturbance.</p>

<p>The circular which sets forth the asserted advantages of the tablets states
that digitalis contains a fat which is an irritant to the gastric membrane. It
also contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We feel no hesitation in saying that if this remedy is given a fair trial where it is properly
indicated, the result obtained will be a gratifying surprise.</p>

<p>“It is a common expression from physicians who have tried this remedy to say, ‘Surely I
have never used Digitalis before.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>If these quotations mean anything, they imply that these tablets present
a distinct advance in digitalis therapy. There is no warrant for such a claim.
The statement with reference to the occurrence of an oil in digitalis is partly
false and partly misleading. Tincture of digitalis, which the tablets are claimed
<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>to represent, is fat free; the fixed oil that is present in the drug is not soluble
in 70 per cent. alcohol, the menstruum used for the preparation of the official
tincture of digitalis. Furthermore, a fairly large amount of this oil (such as
is present in 100 therapeutic doses of the drug) is incapable of causing gastric
disturbance. Gastric disturbance is a side action that is inseparable from
slight overdosage with all true digitalis bodies and is not in any way due
to local gastric action. The claim that such action is prevented by the use
of enteric pills or tablets is obviously false and misleading.</p>

<p>The alleged “common expression from physicians who have tried this
remedy” does not constitute acceptable evidence of the value of the preparation.</p>

<p>The Council declared Westerfield’s Digitalis Tablets inadmissible to New
and Non­official Remedies because unwarranted therapeutic claims are made
for this product.</p>

<p>When the preceding report was submitted to the Westerfield Pharmacal Co.,
a reply was received indicating that the firm did not know that progressive
manufacturers had discontinued the claim that “fat free” digitalis preparations
were devoid of gastric effects. It also submitted a revised circular, which, however,
reiterated the claim that the tablet presented a distinct advance in digitalis
therapy in that it was “fat free,” and coated to prevent disintegration in the
stomach.</p>

<p>Since tincture of digitalis and extract of digitalis are practically devoid of
fatty material, and since it is now well known that the fat does not cause
gastric disturbance and that therapeutic doses of digitalis do not exert a local
irritant action on the stomach, the manufacturer’s product and the claims made
for it merely tend to perpetuate old errors.</p>

<p>The Council declared Westerfield’s Digitalis Tablets inadmissible to New
and Non­official Remedies on the ground that this presents an unessential
modification of pills of an official substance. It directed publication of its
report with this explanation.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and

<h3>XEROFORM-HEYDEN AND BISMUTH TRI­BROM­PHENATE-MERCK
OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on Bismuth
Tri­brom­phenate-Merck and Xeroform-Heyden. These two products were found
not to comply with the standards for bismuth tri­brom­phenate adopted for New
and Non­official Remedies, and hence could not be retained. As the manufacturers
of both products announce that efforts toward the production of a
satisfactory product are continued, the omission of the two brands is without
prejudice to their reacceptance when a satisfactory product becomes available.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The referee in charge of bismuth preparations submitted the following
report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory which shows that Xeroform-Heyden
and Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck do not comply with the adopted standards
for bismuth tri­brom­phenate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some time ago a request was received from the Medical Section of the
National Council of Defense for a report on a brand of bismuth tri­brom­phenate.
In accordance with this request the firm’s product was examined,
and at the same time and for comparison, an examination was also made of
a specimen of bismuth tri­brom­phenate received from Merck and Company,
October, 1915, and of another specimen of bismuth tri­brom­phenate “Xeroform-Heyden”
obtained from the Chicago branch of the Heyden Chemical Works
in April, 1918.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
<p>The examination brought out that the bismuth tri­brom­phenate submitted
to the national Council of Defense contained a large amount of uncombined
tri­brom­phenol, while the specimen of Xeroform-Heyden contained an excessive
quantity of bismuth.</p>

<p>When the latter finding was submitted to the Heyden Chemical Works,
the firm stated: “The product had to be made in this country after importations
from Europe became impossible and the first lots were not fully up
to the standard&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” The firm stated that it could now furnish a product
which it considered fully equal to that which was previously imported, and
offered to submit “samples of the new material.”</p>

<p>Having been requested to do so, a specimen of Xeroform-Heyden was
received from the Heyden Chemical Works, New York. This and a second
specimen, purchased from a Chicago wholesale drug house, were examined.
Whereas the standards for bismuth tri­brom­phenate which had been formulated
by the Laboratory and accepted by the Heyden Chemical Works required
that the product should contain from 40 to 49 per cent. of bismuth and contain
not more than 3.3 per cent. of uncombined tri­brom­phenol, the specimen purchased
in Chicago contained 67.7 per cent. of bismuth, while the specimen
received direct from the Heyden Chemical Works contained 24 per cent.
of uncombined tri­brom­phenol. When this result was reported to the Heyden
Chemical Works, the firm replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs100">

<p>“It seems that we are not yet in a position to supply a product that answers a uniform
standard and that we have to continue our efforts in this direction.</p>

<p>“We will take this matter up with you again as soon as we have been successful&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>At the time when the preceding examination was being made, bismuth
tri­brom­phenate-Merck could not be obtained from the Chicago wholesale
houses. A request sent to Merck and Company for a specimen of the market
supply brought the information that the product was temporarily unavailable.
Though unable to supply the product, the firm gave valuable advice for a
revision of the somewhat loosely drawn tests for bismuth tri­brom­phenate in
New and Non­official Remedies, 1918.</p>

<p>Recently (November, 1918) Merck and Company sent a specimen of its
product labeled “Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck” “Merck and Company, New
York, Distributors and Guarantors,” and wrote “<span class="ell">..</span>. You will notice this
sample conforms in nearly all details to the tests we submitted with our
letter of June 4th. We have been able to produce better goods, but just at
present unsatisfactory starting material confronts us. The sample conforms
to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1918, but will not meet the test for uncombined tri­brom­phenol
submitted by you in your letter of September 4th&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>Examination of the specimen demonstrated that it was soluble to a considerable
extent in alcohol (the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1918, description provides that it
should be only slightly soluble in alcohol) and according to the standards
adopted for New and Non­official Remedies, 1919, contains 18 per cent. uncombined
tri­brom­phenol (more than five times the permitted amount).</p></div>

<p>In view of the Laboratory’s report, the referee recommended that the
acceptance of Xeroform-Heyden and Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck be withdrawn,
without prejudice to their reinstatement when satisfactory products are
again offered for sale. The Council adopted the recommendation of the referee,
and accordingly Xeroform-Heyden and Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck are
omitted from New and Non­official Remedies, 1919.</p>

<p>When the Laboratory’s findings with regard to Xeroform-Heyden and the
action of the Council deleting the article from New and Non­official Remedies
was reported to the Heyden Chemical Works, the firm expressed regret that
efforts to produce a product equal to that formerly obtained from Germany had
<span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>so far not been successful and announced that it had decided to withdraw
Xeroform-Heyden from the market for the present.</p>

<p>When Merck and Company was advised in regard to the report of the
Laboratory and the Council’s action, this firm questioned the feasibility of
producing a product meeting the Council’s standards and suggested that the
test for free tri­brom­phenol be revised to permit as much as 15 per cent. of
this constituent. When Merck and Company was reminded that its product,
submitted in 1915, essentially complied with the adopted standards and that the
estimate of the therapeutic value of bismuth tri­brom­phenate is based on a
product essentially free from alcohol-soluble material, the firm replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“As stated in our letter of the 12th inst. we do not wish to market the chemical unless it
meets all legitimate requirements of the physicians that use it. If, therefore, your standard
proves to be good and it is commercially possible to make supplies conforming to it, we shall
do so. We shall discontinue the article unless it is of suitable quality.”</p></div>

<h3>CREAM OF MUSTARD REFUSED RECOGNITION</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Cream of Mustard, The Cream of Mustard Co., South Norwalk, Conn., is
said to be made by mixing 2 drachms of oil of mustard and 2 drachms of oil
of turpentine with one pound of white petrolatum. According to the label it
is “for Tonsillitis, Rheumatism, Sore Muscles, Croup, Pleurisy, Frosted Feet,
Sore Throat, Neuralgia, Sprains, Bronchitis, Headache, Chilblains, Stiff Neck,
Congestion, Bruises, Asthma, Lumbago, Pains and Aches, Colds in Chest.”</p>

<p>The Council refused recognition to Cream of Mustard:</p>

<p>Because it is a simple pharmaceutical mixture of well-known ingredients
and has no advantage over established rubefacients which every physician
knows how to prescribe and every pharmacist to compound. Incidentally, the
name “Cream of Mustard” is misleading and not descriptive of the composition
of this pharmaceutical of oils of mustard and turpentine.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1918, p.&nbsp;79</i>)</p>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>After considering the evidence for the several “pluriglandular” mixtures
described below, the Council declared them inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies. The Council’s action was communicated to the manufacturer, Henry
R. Harrower, in accordance with the usual procedure. After giving due consideration
to the manufacturer’s reply the Council authorized publication of
the report which appears below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>With the offer “to supply you with as much literature as may be necessary
and as little of the actual remedies as may be desired” if “the prospects for
the inclusion of these formulas in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. are good,” Henry R. Harrower
<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>sent the Council a booklet descriptive of his preparations and labels for the
following mixtures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Caps. Adreno-Spermin Comp.</i>, each said to contain “Adrenal Gland (total) gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>, Thyroid

<p><i>Caps. Antero-Pituitary Comp.</i>, each said to contain “Anterior Pituitary Body gr.&nbsp;2, Thymus

<p><i>Caps. Hepato-Splenic Comp.</i>, each said to contain “Liver Parenchyma, Spleen Substance

<p><i>Caps. Pancreas Comp.</i>, each said to contain “Adrenal Gland, Pituitary Gland (total) aa gr.
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>, Ovarian Substance gr.&nbsp;1, Pancreas Substance q.&nbsp;s.&nbsp;ad gr.&nbsp;5.”</p>

Calcium-phosphorus Comp. q.&nbsp;s.&nbsp;ad gr.&nbsp;5.”</p></div>

<p>The Council declared these preparations inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, for reasons which follow:</p>

<p>1. Each of the mixtures contains one ingredient or more, which is neither
recognized in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia nor admitted to New and Non­official
Remedies, namely: “Spermin Extract,” “Brain,” “Spinal Cord,” “Desiccated
Placenta,” “Liver Parenchyma,” “Spleen Substance,” “Pancreas Substance” and
“Calcium Phosphorus Comp. (Each 100&nbsp;gm. represents Magnes. Phos. 1; Calc.
glycerophos. 4; Potas. bicarb. 15; Sod. bicarb. 22 and Sod. chlor. q. s.).” For
obvious reasons the Council does not accept a mixture containing an indefinite
ingredient and hence it would be necessary as a preliminary for the consideration
of any one of the mixtures that their unofficial ingredients be made eligible for
New and Non­official Remedies by the submission of evidence that such ingredient
is of uniform composition and that it is thera­peutically valuable when given
by mouth. There is no evidence that many of these organs have any value
whatever when administered by the mouth or in any other way.</p>

<p>2. In the light of our knowledge the administration of gland mixtures in
the host of conditions enumerated in the advertising circular is irrational and
on a par with the use of the shotgun mixtures once in vogue.</p>

<p>Be it a pharmaceutical mixture, a “mixed” vaccine, or a “pluriglandular”
product, the combination of two medicinal ingredients in a mixture must be
considered contrary to rational therapy unless a good reason exists for such
combination. Such mixtures are held in conflict with Rule 10 unless the manufacturer
presents acceptable evidence for the value of his combination. A
physician may prescribe any mixture which he considers indicated in a given
case, but the marketing of mixtures of drugs in fixed proportions is in most
instances irrational and a detriment to sound therapy.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 18, 1919</i>)</p>

<h3>CERELENE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report declaring
Cerelene inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span></p>
<p>Cerelene, a paraffin preparation for the treatment of burns, was submitted
to the Council by the Holliday Laboratories, with the statement that it was
composed of 84 per cent. paraffin, 15 per cent. myricyl palmitate, and 1 per cent.
purified elemi gum to which is added oil of eucalyptus 2 per cent. and betanaphthol
0.25 per cent. It was explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Myricyl Palmitate is a purified form of Beeswax, free from all impurities,
acids, etc., which is solely manufactured by this Company<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>It was also stated that on “special order” Cerelene has been made containing
oil of eucalyptus and resorcin, oil of eucalyptus and picric acid, and picric
acid alone. The following report on the preparation was presented to the
Council by the referee to whom Cerelene had been assigned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cerelene is another compound wax for the treatment of burns. According
to the work of Sollmann (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., <b>68</b>:1799, 1917) it is highly improbable
that compound mixtures have any advantage over simple paraffin of
low melting point. Cerelene must therefore be considered as an unessential
modification of paraffin, and as in conflict with Rule 10; unless definite evidence
of superiority is submitted. Cerelene mixtures containing medicinal ingredients
also appear unscientific since the evidence that the ingredients do not
leave the wax has not been successfully contradicted. Finally, the claims made
for Cerelene are rather extreme, and would need some revision before they
could be accepted.</p></div>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports:</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">The physical properties of Cerelene are as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal">Melting point 50.0&nbsp;C. by U. S. P. method.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Ductility limit</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">30.5 C.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Plasticity limit</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">26.4 C.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Not strong at</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">38&#8200;&#8199; C.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="ml2em fs85">Adheres moderately well; detaches with “pulling.” On heating,
readily loses eucalyptol, and a small amount of resinous substance
forms in the bottom of the beaker. If Cerelene is heated to 145
C. and cooled, the resulting product no longer has the properties of
the original Cerelene.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the preceding report be sent to the Holliday Laboratories,
and that unless its superiority over simple paraffins is demonstrated and
the unwarranted claims abandoned, Cerelene be declared inadmissible to
New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rules 6 and 10.</p>

<p>This report was submitted to the Holliday Laboratories with the information
that it had been adopted, Oct. 3, 1917. It was also explained that before
Cerelene could be accepted, the unofficial and unstandardized constituent “myricyl
palmitate” would have to be considered and accepted for New and Non­official
Remedies since, for obvious reasons, the Council does not accept a preparation
which contains an unofficial and unstandardized substance not in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>The Holliday Laboratories acknowledged receipt of the Council’s report and
asked that the matter be held in abeyance until the requested evidence had been
obtained. Later the Council was advised that the advertising circulars for
Cerelene had been withdrawn with the exception of one giving directions for
its use. Five months later, the firm stated that experiments were being made
“to determine the actual strength of Cerelene in comparison with other paraffin
waxes<span class="ell">...</span>.” Nothing further has been heard from the Holliday Laboratories
and no reply has been received to an inquiry made Oct. 12, 1918. The
Council therefore authorizes publication of its report declaring Cerelene inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From the Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb.

<h3>COLLOSOL COCAINE NOT ADMITTED TO N. N. R</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The report which appears below was adopted by the Council and sent to
the Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd., New York, for comment in December, 1918.
No explanation has been received from the manufacturer. For the information
of the profession the Council has now authorized publication of the report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Collosol Cocaine” was submitted to the Council in October, 1918, by the
Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd., New York, under the claim that it was an
“absolute colloid” and that it contained “1 per cent. cocain.” The label on the
submitted specimen declares:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Collosol Cocaine 1-100”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the Cocaine exists as the pure alkaloid in the Colloidal state&mdash;the condition
in which it is isomorphic with the protein of the body fluids. The effect is more prolonged
than that of a molecular Cocaine Solution and being <i>non-toxic</i> absorption presents no practical
danger.”</p></div>

<p>The product was assigned to the Committee on Pharmacology for consideration.
The following report was submitted and its adoption by the Council
recommended by the committee:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Collosol Cocaine” is said to be a colloidal form of cocain and is alleged
to possess a remarkably low toxicity. The subjoined report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory, however, shows that the preparation does not have
the composition claimed for it and it is, in effect, misbranded. In fact, the
English manufacturers concede that it is not an “absolute colloid” and that
the declaration with regard to the percentage of cocain is incorrect.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, without considering other conflicts with
the rules of the Council at this time, “Collosol Cocaine” be declared inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies for conflict with Rule 1 which
requires that the composition of an article must be correctly declared.
The report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory is appended.</p></div>


<h5>REPORT OF THE A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. CHEMICAL LABORATORY</h5>

<p>Simpson, Hewlett and Eyre (<i>Lancet</i>, April 28, 1917, p.&nbsp;660) reported
“Collosol Cocaine” to be much less toxic than cocain. These writers, however,
did not verify the statements as to the composition and in the light of subsequent
chemical examination it is not to be wondered at that “Collosol Cocaine
1.0 per cent.” was much less toxic than a solution containing 1.0 per cent. of
cocain hydrochlorid.</p>

<p>Barger, Dale and Durham report from the Department of Biochemistry and
Pharmacology, Medical Research Committee (<i>Lancet</i>, Dec. 1, 1917, p.&nbsp;825),
that they examined “Collosol Cocaine” and found it to contain but 0.25 per cent.
of cocain. They also found that the cocain was not present in a colloidal form.
Discussing the low toxicity claimed by the manufacturers, these investigators
state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the samples which we examined the toxicity was, indeed, much lower than that of an
ordinary 1 per cent. solution of a cocain salt; but the local anesthetic action was low to a
corresponding degree, and both actions corresponded satisfactorily with the proportion of
cocain chemically recoverable from the solution.”</p></div>

<p>Stroud, of the Crookes Laboratory (which manufactures the preparation),
who apparently had been informed of this work in advance of publication,
admits the correctness of it, and states (<i>British Medical Journal</i>, Nov. 24,
1918, p.&nbsp;710) that “whilst the colloidal protective apparently absorbs a portion
of the cocain, the remainder is found not to exhibit the attributes of a
colloid<span class="ell">,..</span>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span></p>
<p>The specimen of “Collosol Cocaine” submitted to the Council and labeled
“Collosol Cocaine 1-100” was found to contain at most 0.4 per cent. cocain.
The examination was made in accordance with the method used by Barger, Dale
and Durham and calculated as cocain. This method, however, probably would
not distinguish between cocain and basic decomposition products, but would
include all as cocain in the amount found. The specimen of “Collosol Cocaine”
examined was neutral or slightly acid, a fact which tends to confirm the conclusion
of the British investigators that “Collosol Cocaine” contains cocain
in noncolloidal form and precludes an increased physiologic effect due to
alkalinity.</p>

<p>The Council adopted both the report submitted by the committee and
that of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Laboratory and declared “Collosol Cocaine” inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 12,

<h3>CUPRASE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on Cuprase,
sold by the Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd. The Council’s criticisms of the
advertising claims were sent to the firm, December, 1918. The firm made no
reply and essentially the same claims are contained in recent advertisements.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Cuprase” is now being advertised and sold in the United States by the
Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd., the firm which also markets it in England.
It is said to be “prepared in the Laboratories of F. Ducatte, 8 Place de la
Medeleine, Paris.” According to an advertising circular entitled “The Medical
Treatment of Cancer” “Cuprase” is “chemical colloidal copper”; in another
place it is “a colloidal copper hydroxid,” which is said to be obtained chemically
by the reduction of salts of copper in the presence of albumosic acid.</p>

<p>A box (price $8.50 less 10 per cent. discount) of “Cuprase-Doctor Gaube du
Gers” was purchased recently from the Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd. It
contained eight ampules each containing approximately 6&nbsp;c.c. of a brownish
fluorescent liquid. No information of composition was given on the box,
except the line: “Chaque ampoule contient: 0&nbsp;gr. .00121 de Cuivre pur” (Each
ampule contains 0.00121&nbsp;gr. of pure copper). The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
reports that the preparation does contain a small amount of copper, with
some protein material and about 1 per cent. sodium chlorid.</p>

<p>The therapeutic claims in the advertising circular are those commonly made
for cancer “cures” and are about equally convincing. The publication of
such statements and quotations as the following, which appear in a pamphlet
“The Medical Treatment in Cancer,” cannot be too strongly condemned in a
medicament that at best has only an experimental status:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A special preparation, Cuprase, has been introduced into therapeutics which has been
remarkably successful. In the history of the therapeutics of cancer, nothing has been
found which can compare with the effects produced by means of Cuprase. Clinical facts
carry greater weight than theoretical deductions. It follows, from the clinical observations
which I have collected, that in the large majority of cases Cuprase effects the diminution
or disappearance of the pains, an improvement in the general condition, a diminution or
arrest of the neoplasms, and finally in certain cases, a cure has been effected. It should be
remarked that all or nearly all the observations refer to inoperable cases in which the
prognosis was unfavorable at an early date. It is needless to emphasize the practical importance
of a preparation capable of yielding such results, even relative, in the worst stages
of a disease which has always been regarded as absolutely resisting the action of all internal
remedies.”</p>

<p>“To sum up, Cuprase has given positive results in about 94 per cent. of the cases in
which it has been employed for a sufficiently long period, and some brilliant results in about
<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>20 per cent. of these cases. Therefore, it may be affirmed, that among the internal remedies
for cancer, Cuprase is the one which has produced the most successful results, and can,
under certain circumstances, compete with surgical methods, even, so far as the rapidity of
their results are concerned.”</p>

<p>“It is indicated:</p>

<p>(a) apart from all operation, and as a specific and curative remedy;</p>

<p>(b) before an operation, in order to give tone to the patient, mobilise the tumor,
destroy its toxins;</p>

<p>(c) after the operation, as a tonic and anti-toxic, and in order to avoid frequent
relapses which are always possible.”</p>
</div>

<p>Essentially the same statements are made in the more recent advertisements
(f. i. Urological and Cutaneous Review, Feb., 1919). Opposed to these loose
statements are the results of Richard Weil (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., 1913, Sept.
27, p.&nbsp;1034; ibid, 1915, April 17, p.&nbsp;1283). Weil avoided pitfalls of subjective
impressions and used as the essential criterion of efficiency “the demonstrable
reduction in size of a tumor, of a kind not to be attributed to the natural
processes of evolution of that tumor or of its associated lesions” (l. c. 1915,
p.&nbsp;1289).</p>

<p>The available evidence for Cuprase is far from meeting this criterion. That
published by the manufacturers and agents presents only vague generalities,
and no definite data. The evidence gathered by Weil himself permits an
estimate of the value of Cuprase and it is entirely unfavorable. He states
(l.c. 1915, p.&nbsp;1288):</p>

<p>“Colloidal copper has been used in recent time for the same purpose by
Gaube du Gers and by others. I have recently examined the effects of colloidal
copper on malignant tumors in man, and have been unable to find that it has
any therapeutic value. Furthermore, a study of the distribution of the copper
in tumors obtained at operation or by necropsy from individuals so treated
failed to show that the copper had been deposited therein.”</p>

<p>In view of the extravagant and cruelly misleading therapeutic claims, and
the indefinite statements of composition, the Council voted Cuprase ineligible to
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., and authorized the publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 12, 1919.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>COLLOSOL PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted and authorized publication of the report which
appears below declaring “Collosol Argentum,” “Collosol Arsenicum,” “Collosol
Cocain,” “Collosol Cuprum,” “Collosol Ferrum,” “Collosol Hydrargyrum,” “Collosol
Iodin,” “Collosol Manganese,” “Collosol Quinin” and “Collosol Sulphur”
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies, because their composition is
uncertain (conflict with Rule 1). In the few cases in which the therapeutic
claims for these preparations were examined, the claims were found to be
so improbable or exaggerated (conflict with Rules 6 and 10) as to have necessitated
the rejection of these products.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary</p>

<p>The Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd., London and New York, in November,
1918, requested the Council to consider the products “Collosol Argentum,”
“Collosol Arsenicum,” “Collosol Cocain,” “Collosol Cuprum,” “Collosol Ferrum,”
“Collosol Hydrargyrum,” “Collosol Iodin,” “Collosol Manganese,” “Collosol
Quinin” and “Collosol Sulphur.” The term “Collosol” appears to be a group
designation for what are claimed to be permanent colloidal solutions, marketed
by the Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd. Were this claim correct, “Collosols”
should contain their active constituents in the form of microscopic or ultramicroscopic
suspensions, protected against spontaneous precipitation by the
presence of proteins or some similar “stabilizers.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span></p>
<p>According to the original patent specifications for Collosols, the metals are
precipitated or treated with “peptone,” which acts as the suspending or stabilizing
agent. The method of using the peptone makes it doubtful, in the first place,
whether the major part of the metals is present in colloidal form, or merely
in the form of peptonates, i.&nbsp;e., as ordinary salts. Moreover, the later patents
indicate that the products have been unsatisfactory; “experience having shown
that some metal colloids under certain conditions not yet fully understood have
the tendency to break down after a certain period” (U.&nbsp;S. patent No. 1,116,247).
Phenol, it is claimed has a tendency to counteract this decomposition, and the
patent covers the use of phenol for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how phenol could possibly have such action. In fact, it
obviously does not, for a number of the samples of Collosols submitted to the
Council had separated. For instance, “Collosol Hydrargyrum” was not a colloidal
solution at all, but a suspension of a coarse powder. The ampules of
“Collosol Ferrum” contained a considerable quantity of flocculent precipitate.
If either of these preparations were injected intravenously as directed, death
might result, making the physician morally if not legally liable.</p>

<p>The recklessness of the claims is further illustrated by the advice that
these indefinite mixtures of poisonous metals can be injected in unlimited
quantities. Thus, Henry Crookes stated (<i>Chemical News</i>, May 7, 1914, p.&nbsp;218)
that Collosols “contain so small a proportion of metal, viz., 1 in 2000, that even
a poisonous body like arsenic can be used with impunity.” He stated that they
may be applied as a lotion, intramuscular or intravenous injection, and that “one
pint or more can be injected intravenously.”</p>

<p>In the case of “Collosol Cocain,” as was brought out in the Council’s report
published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, April 12, 1919, the manufacturers have admitted
that the product is not what they have claimed&mdash;and still claim&mdash;for it. The
report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory showed that “Collosol Cocain,”
instead of containing 1 per cent. cocain as claimed, contained, in fact, at most
not more than 0.4 per cent. cocain.</p>

<p>The report of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory on the Collosol products
was sent by the Council to the New York office of the Anglo-French Drug
Co., Ltd., in duplicate in order to facilitate reference to the London office. This
was some months ago. The information which the Council requested has
not yet been received, nor has the Anglo-French Drug Co., Ltd., indicated its
intention of supplying such information. On the other hand, claims to which
specific objection have been made, continue to appear in current advertising.
Accordingly, the Council authorizes publication of this report, and declares
the Collosol preparations previously named ineligible to New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>


<h4>Additional Notes on Collosol Evidence</h4>

<p>In addition to the preceding the following notes of the referee on the evidence
so far submitted were sent to the Anglo-French Drug Company, Ltd.,
for consideration:</p>

<p><i>Collosol Iodine</i>: The leaflet which describes Collosol Iodine contains claims
that are improbable, not in accord with accepted facts nor substantiated by
evidence; for instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This preparation contains Iodine in its most active form&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“The disadvantages of ‘iodism’ and nausea frequently associated with iodides never occur
with Collosol Iodine.”</p>

<p>“In the case of Colloidal Iodine the whole of the Iodine is absorbed and enters into molecular
combination with protein to form an iodo-amino acid and <span class="ell">..</span>. exerts a reducing action
on the lipoids producing a different condition of the blood&mdash;hence the use of Iodine as an
‘alterative’.”</p>

<p>“Intravenously the action of Collosol Iodine is more rapid <span class="ell">..</span>. in cases of pyemia <span class="ell">..</span>.
thus showing its absolute non-toxicity.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
<p>“&#8239;‘Per se’ Colloidal Iodine is only slightly parasitotropic and bacteriotropic but micro-organisms
are very greatly influenced by its action, and not only is the effect of a subsequently
administered remedy greatly increased but also the insoluble colloidal protein of
serum itself is reduced to smaller particles, thus increasing its surface and adsorptive
capacity and consequent germicidal power. In some cases the serum, thus aided, is enabled
to throw off a milk microbial invasion. The above action can be readily demonstrated ‘in
vitro’ by means of the ultramicroscope.”</p>

<p>“In Cancer, the intravenous injection of Collosol Iodine relieves pain, even where large
dosage of morphine is ineffective.”</p>

<p>“In Rheumatism the ionic method of treatment with Collosol Iodine is strongly advised.”</p>

<p>“In Recovery from Alcoholism the internal administration of Collosol Iodine restores
the normal condition of cell activity, ensuring rapid recovery.”</p></div>

<p><i>Collosol Hydrargyrum</i>: This is said to be a preparation of colloidal mercury
and would therefore be similar to Electromercurol (New and Non­official Remedies,
1919, p.&nbsp;167). Colloidal mercury preparations have been used to some
extent; they appear to have no decided advantage over other, noncolloidal,
mercury compounds. They differ sufficiently from them, however, to justify
acceptance for New and Non­official Remedies, providing that reasonable claims
are made for them. The leaflet advertising Collosol Hydrargyrum contains
statements that cannot be accepted and require thorough revision to make them
acceptable. The following are instances:</p>

<p>“Although&mdash;especially locally&mdash;the action of mercurials is markedly antiseptic, when
taken internally or injected, it has been stated by some of the best known authorities, that
their action is rather to increase the natural resisting power of the body to disease, probably
because of stimulation of the oxidases.”</p>

<p>With the soluble mercurials “considerable upset of the normal cell conditions of the
tissues ensues whilst these soluble salts are being converted to a condition in which the
body can make use of them.”</p>

<p>“The colloidal state  <span class="ell">..</span>. is stated by some authorities in the case of mercury to
be invariably precedent to absorption<span class="ell">...</span>. With the usual forms of mercury the
danger of too great a dose per cell is considerable, but in the case of colloidal mercury,
the diffusion is extremely rapid and chemical affinity low. Hence the danger to the
individual leucocyte is minimized and the maximum effect obtained.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. absence of pain is usual in the administration of colloidal preparations and
is due to their isomorphism with the colloidal lipoid and protein of the tissues and body
fluids.”</p>

<p>“According to McDonagh<span class="ell">,..</span>. mercury acts as an oxidizing agent and that the
process of oxidation is more effective in the early stages of syphilis in producing the death
of the causal organism&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p><i>Collosol Manganese</i>: The circular submitted to the referee is a reprint of a
paper by Sir Malcolm Morris on “The Treatment of Furunculosis and Other
Deep-Seated Coccogenic Infections by Collosol Manganese.” It reports four
cases of furunculosis, each of which cleared up after the intramuscular injection
of a few doses of Collosol Manganese. The author seems to attribute the cure
to the manganese but the evidence is not convincing. Even the author admits
that, in the treatment of furunculosis in general “when at last the dismal
procession ends, this often appears to be less the result of treatment than
because the disease has run its natural course.” Unless much better evidence
is in existence, the preparation must be considered to conflict with Rule 6, which
requires therapeutic claims to be substantiated.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Argentum</i>: The evidence submitted as to actions consists of a single
reprint by Roe, which is not convincing, and this fantastic statement by Boys:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A young girl, aged 18, came to my house with acute inflammation of one eye with
an ulcer on the cornea. Two drops of Collosol Argentum were dropped in the eye at
7&nbsp;p.&nbsp;m., and a pad placed over the eye. When she came next morning the eye was quite
well; the ulcer had disappeared, and there was no inflammation.”</p></div>

<p>There is no evidence that this preparation acts as catalyzer and assists the
natural resisting bodies of the tissues; or that these are “oxygen carriers.”
Unless the claims are supported by better evidence, they, in the opinion of the
referee, could not be accepted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span></p>
<p>There have been submitted to the Council samples of the following metallic
Collosols:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>Also Collosols of Iodine and Sulphur, and finally Collosols of Cocain and
Quinin. Of all the above, except sulphur, only three small ampules have been
submitted. This does not admit of any chemical examination but a statement
of the physical appearance may be of interest.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Arsenicum</i>, 0.2 per cent.: Very turbid with large quantities of a
lemon yellow flocculent precipitate. On shaking does not become homogeneous
and rapidly separates again.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Argentum</i>, 1-2000: The liquid has a slight opalescence. There is
considerable deposit of a heavy black precipitate. Does not become homogeneous
on shaking and the black substance quickly separates again.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Cuprum</i>, 0.5 <i>per cent.</i>: Dark red somewhat opalescent liquid. No
precipitate. May be colloidal.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Ferrum</i>, 1-2000: Liquid clear. Large quantities of dark brown
flocculent precipitate. The precipitate is not distributed evenly when the mixture
is shaken and settles out quickly on standing.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Hydrargyrum, 5 per cent.</i>: Milky liquid. Large quantities of white
deposit mixed with considerable black. The deposit mixes fairly well but the
greater part settles out after standing an hour or two.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Manganese</i>, 2.5-1000: Clear reddish-brown liquid without deposit of
any kind. Is not opalescent or fluorescent.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Iodin</i>, 1-500: Very pale straw colored liquid without deposit. Has
a slight opalescence.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Sulphur</i>, 1-100: Liquid is opalescent. There is some deposit of
yellow particles. A four ounce bottle was also submitted. The liquid in this
bottle is milky with considerable deposit of yellow crystals like ordinary crystalline
sulphur.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Cocain</i>, 1-100: Transparent, colorless liquid with no deposit. Chemical
examination showed 0.4 per cent. of what may have been cocain. This
residue gave alkaloidal tests.</p>

<p><i>Collosol Quinin</i>, 1-100: Slightly opalescent, colorless liquid, with no deposit.
Gives alkaloidal reactions.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 7, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>PULVOIDS CALCYLATES COMPOUND</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report, not so much
because the preparation with which it deals is of any great importance, but as a
protest against the large number of similar irrational complex mixtures which
are still offered to physicians.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Pulvoids Calcylates Compound (The Drug Products Co., Inc.) are tablets
each of which is claimed to contain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Calcium and Strontium Disalicylate, 5&nbsp;grs.; Resin Guaiac, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.; Digitalis, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.; Cochium
[colchicum?] Seed, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.; Squill, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.; Cascarin, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub></span>&nbsp;gr. with aromatics.”</p></div>

<p>“Pulvoids Calcylates Compound (Sugar coated orange color)” is advertised
(<i>Medical Times</i>, January, 1919) as being “Analgesic-Antipyretic and Diuretic,”
and is included in the preparations designated by the advertiser as “Approved
Remedies for LaGrippe and ‘Flu.’&#8239;” The claim that “Their tolerance is remarkable”
<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>refers not to the physicians who tolerate such products, but to the alleged
fact that Pulvoids Calcylates are tolerated remarkably well. The advertisement
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“May be given persistently and continuously without gastric disturbances.”</p>

<p>“They are uniformly efficient. More certain in effect than the ordinary Salicylates.”</p></div>

<p>It would be difficult to find an advertisement of equal length containing a
greater number of misleading or directly false statements than are found in
this one. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> (April 22, 1916, p.&nbsp;1307) has called attention to the
lack of justification for this absurd mixture of drugs and has discussed the
preparation with especial reference to its use in acute rheumatism, in which
the salicylates occupy a special field. The advertisement just quoted mentions
La Grippe and “Flu” (or Influenza) as special fields of usefulness for this
preparation. This, apparently, is merely an attempt to spread the sail for
any breeze. Salicylates have a field of usefulness in influenza in that they often
afford relief from pain. There is no reason to suppose that a mixture containing
calcium and strontium salicylates&mdash;the “Calcium and Strontium Disalicylate”
of Pulvoids Calcylates is probably a mixture of calcium and strontium
<span class="nowrap">salicylate<a name="FNanchor_127_133" id="FNanchor_127_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_133" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>&mdash;has any greater salicylic effect than an equal amount of sodium
salicylate. On the other hand, it is worse than useless to give colchicum, squill
and digitalis for the relief of such pains.</p>

<p>Should cardiac dilatation develop, and digitalis medication be required it
would be impossible to adjust the dose of such a mixture with special reference
to the digitalis action, which alone would be indicated for that condition. No
educated physician at present would think of giving resin of guaiac merely
because his patient required digitalis, nor would he administer “cascarin,”
whatever that may be, in fixed doses, every time he gave a dose of salicylate.</p>

<p>It is impossible to recognize the several effects induced by this therapeutic
omneity, and the medical profession should consider it an insult to be offered
mixtures such as Pulvoids Calcylates Compound.</p>

<p>Pulvoids Calcylates Compound is, per se, of no great importance; it is one
of a type. It has been selected as one of the utterly irrational and therefore
potentially dangerous mixtures, that may be found by the score or the hundred
in the catalogues of practically every pharmaceutical manufacturing firm in
the United States.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 14, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>PROTEOGENS OF THE WM. S. MERRELL COMPANY</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted and authorized publication of the statement which
appears below, declaring Proteogen No. 1 (Plantex) for Cancer, Proteogen
No. 2 for Rheumatism, Proteogen No. 3 for Tuberculosis, Proteogen No. 4
for Hay Fever and Bronchial Asthma, Proteogen No. 5 for Dermatoses, Proteogen
No. 6 for Chlorosis, Proteogen No. 7 for Secondary Anemia, Proteogen
No. 8 for Pernicious Anemia, Proteogen No. 9 for Goitre, Proteogen No. 10
for Syphilis, Proteogen No. 11 for Gonorrhea, and Proteogen No. 12 for
Influenza and Pneumonia inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because
their composition is secret; because the therapeutic claims made for them are
unwarranted; and because the secrecy and complexity of their composition
makes the use of these preparations irrational.</p>

<p>The Council took up the consideration of the Merrell Proteogens because of
inquiries received, and on January 27 invited the Merrell Company to aid in
the proposed investigation by submitting information in regard to the composition
<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>of the preparations, submitting the current advertising, and presenting
evidence for the claims that were made for the preparations. While the
Merrell Company agreed to submit the requested information, this had not
been received at the time the report of the referee to whom the products
had been assigned (Referee 1), was adopted. This report was sent to the
company on April 4. In reply the Merrell Company protested against the
conclusions of the report and submitted considerable material in an attempt
to support the claims made for the products. This material was examined by
the first referee and then transmitted to a second referee (Referee 2) for
consideration. The second referee concluded that the matter submitted
offered no evidence that would justify the Council in modifying the report first
adopted, and hence recommended that its publication be authorized.</p>

<p>In accordance with this recommendation (report of Referee 2) the Council
authorized the publication of the reports of both the first and second referees.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h4>Report of First Referee on Proteogens</h4>

<p>“Proteogens,” according to the William S. Merrell Co., are “Polyvalent
Proteins of Non-Toxic Plant Origin.” The subject of Proteogens can best be
approached by recalling the history of “Autolysin,” an alleged remedy for
cancer, originated by A.&nbsp;S. Horowitz, Ph.D. This was exploited some years
ago, and was finally shown to be worthless. Proteogens are said to be prepared
“under the personal supervision of the originator, Dr. A.&nbsp;S. Horowitz.”
The composition of the different Proteogens is essentially secret. The assertion
was made at one time, but is not found in the present advertising matter, that
Plantex&mdash;now called “Proteogen No. 1”&mdash;is similar to Autolysin. Now the
Proteogens are said to be “prepared by a special process employing various
combinations of plants.” Further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The biologic principles present are chlorophyll, chromoplast, lipoids and vitamines; these
are ferments or enzymes. The vegetable acids, metalloids and metals present in all plants in
colloid form act biochemically. Among the metalloids are hydrogen, carbon, manganese,
oxygen, sulphur, phosphorus and chlorine; the heavy metals are iron, potassium, sodium, magnesium
and copper. These biochemic principles are always present in plants as colloids.”</p></div>

<p>It is claimed by the Merrell Company that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Proteogens stimulate the cytogenic mechanism to higher activity; therefore, indirectly
cleave the invading microorganism and eliminate their special toxins. Proteogens swing the
disturbed metabolism back to normal and, by natural processes, build up effective defenses
against recurrent bacterial attacks.”</p></div>

<p>Proteogen No. 1 was first introduced as “Plantex,” and at that time the
Merrell Company referred to a preparation that was the result of “a series
of studies” carried out by a “noted biologist” with a view of “evolving a Cancer
remedy” that was “to be autolytic in character,” and announced:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The House of Merrell always interested in the progress of plant therapy, began pharmacological
experimentations to reproduce this same substance. The qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the substance as used in New York having been published simplified matters.
A somewhat similar remedy has now been prepared. It consists of the following substances&mdash;Menyanthes
trifoliata [Buckbean], Melilotus officinalis [Yellow sweet clover], Mentha crispa
[Curled mint], Brassica alba [White mustard], Anemone hepatica [Liver leaf], Viola tricolor
[Pansy], Anthemis [Roman chamomile], Fructus colocynthidis [Colocynth], Lignum quassiæ
[Quassia], Urtica dioica [Nettle], Radix rhei [Rhubarb root], Hedge hyssop. These substances
are in approximately equal proportions with the exception of the mustard which forms
20 per cent. of the mixture, and the colocynth fruit which is 5 per cent.”</p></div>

<p>With respect also to the other Proteogens listed above, study of medical
literature revealed no evidence establishing their therapeutic value; in fact,
no evidence was found other than that appearing in the advertising matter
<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>of the manufacturer. The range of diseases in which Proteogens are recommended
is so wide as to make obvious the lack of scientific judgment which
characterizes their exploitation. A circular letter, received January, 1919,
reminded the physician that about a year ago his attention had been directed
to Proteogen No. 1 for cancer, that later developments enabled the firm to
recommend for his consideration “a series of Proteogens (Nos. 2 to 9),”
and that now “In response to an insistent demand, Dr. A.&nbsp;S. Horowitz has prepared
two new Proteogens&mdash;No. 10 for Syphilis and No. 11 for Gonorrhea.” A
postscript to this circular letter announced another preparation, “Proteogen
No. 12 for Influenza and Pneumonia,” a “development out of the present influenza
epidemic,” and admitted that “It has not had the clinical experimentation
that precedes our introduction of a new product.”</p>

<p>The introduction of No. 12 was effected by means of a special bulletin which
consists exclusively of clinical reports from seven physicians, all from Chicago
save one, and all purporting to show most favorable results from No. 12. They
describe cases which any physician with experience with influenza can duplicate
without any special treatment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give serious consideration to a set of alleged remedies when
the only evidence is that furnished by the proponents of the alleged remedies.
This is particularly true when the alleged remedy does not make a sufficient
appeal to one’s sense of the rational in therapeutics to lead one to feel justified
in asking a trial at the hands of careful clinical observers. Considering the
grave nature of the diseases for which Proteogens are recommended, particularly
cancer, tuberculosis, and pernicious anemia, the want of a rational basis for
the method of treatment and the general tenor of the advertising matter, it
appears safe to conclude that these agents do not represent any definite advance
in therapeutics.</p>

<p>As the use of preparations, secret in composition, and of no established
value, is contrary to rational therapy, it is recommended that the Proteogen
preparations be declared in conflict with Rules 1, 6 and 10.</p>


<h4>Report of Second Referee Reviewing Manufacturers’ Reply</h4>

<p>The report declaring the Proteogens of the William S. Merrell Company
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies was adopted by the Council,
but before publication it was sent to the Merrell Company for such comments
as it might desire to make. In due time the reply of the firm was received.
It consisted of two volumes bound in limp morocco, each stamped in gold:
“Report Proteogen Therapy Requested by the American Medical Association,
1919; The Wm. S. Merrell Company.” The first volume contained 79 pages
of typewritten material; the second volume contained 76 pages of typewritten
material and a number of advertising booklets put out by the Wm. S. Merrell
Company, exploiting the Proteogens.</p>

<p>Among the typewritten material was a 14-page report on “Proteogen
Therapy” by its originator, A.&nbsp;S. Horowitz. Following this there are several
pages devoted to what is termed “a short qualitative description of the ingredients
of major importance in Proteogens.” Then follows a page describing
the advertising of Proteogens, and the remainder of the two books is devoted
to testimonials, lauding the benefit of Proteogens in diseases such as cancer,
tuberculosis, rheumatism, asthma, influenza, enlarged prostate, rheumatic endocarditis,
syphilis, eczema, psoriasis, diabetes, secondary anemia, gono­coccic
infections, etc. Finally, there are attached samples of advertising pamphlets.</p>

<p>The dissertation by A.&nbsp;S. Horowitz contains little actual information concerning
these substances, but is concerned principally with discussion of foreign
proteins, “antiferments,” “non-specific proteins,” “anti-virolins” and speculations
on their hypothetical actions and interactions on each other and on the organs
of the body and on bacteria. The report contains many questionable statements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span></p>
<p>One finds in this report but few definite statements of facts which are
known to be accurate or which could be accepted without question. The qualitative
description of the proteins and their components is as vague as the
previous discussion. The differentiation between the various Proteogens is
extremely indefinite; that for Tuberculosis, No. 3 is described as “polyvalent,
non-specific protein which rapidly attacks the acid-fast, encapsulated tubercle
bacilli”; Proteogen No. 10 for syphilis is said to be a combination of “non-specific
plant proteins and different chemicals which has the power to paralyze
and destroy living spirochete.” It is stated that Proteogens are scientific
preparations based on standard ingredients and that the standard­ization is
more accurate than in serums, vaccines or toxins, etc. The report gives no
proof of such statements.</p>

<p>The testimonials that are submitted are typical of “reports” that manufacturers
are able to obtain from some physicians, to prove the efficacy of almost
any preparation in any disease. Each consists, practically, of the opinion of
the individual who has employed the Proteogens or the opinion of the patient
who has been treated. Few data are given in these reports from which an
impartial conclusion might be drawn. A few of the testimonials presented
by the William S. Merrell Company follow. The valuelessness of such material
as scientific evidence is obvious:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rheumatism</span>:&mdash;<i>Proteogen No. 2.</i>&mdash;The Doctor has one case being treated with No. 2.
She has improved so rapidly she cannot express her pleasure, and will continue for some time

<p><span class="smcap">Syphilis</span>:&mdash;<i>Proteogen No. 10.</i>&mdash;I am getting such excellent results with the No. 10 Proteogen

<p><span class="smcap">Tuberculosis</span>:&mdash;<i>Proteogen No. 3.</i>&mdash;The Doctor writes: The Proteogen No. 3 sent me
worked wonders in my patient. The case came under my care when he was too far gone for

either by clerical error, or because the results were considered remarkable, was repeated
elsewhere in the material submitted by the Merrell Company.]</p>

of buttock some six months ago with favorable results and no return of symptoms as yet.&mdash;April
13, 1919.</p></div>

<p>It is obvious that the Proteogen preparations are in conflict with Rules 1,
6 and 10, and should not be admitted to “New and Non­official Remedies.” It
is recommended that the previous action of the Council be allowed to stand
and that publication of both reports be authorized.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 12, 1919</i>)</p>

<h3>“ARSENOVEN S. S.” AND “ARSENO-METH-HYD”</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council authorizes publication of the following report. This report
declares Arsenoven S.&nbsp;S. of the S.&nbsp;S. Products Company and Solution of
Arsenic and Mercury (formerly called Arseno-Meth-Hyd) of the New York
Intravenous Laboratory, inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies. The
Council takes this opportunity to repeat its warning against the abuses&mdash;often
dangerous&mdash;to which patients are frequently subjected when “intravenous
therapy” is employed.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Because of inquiries received, the Council took up the consideration of
Arsenoven S.&nbsp;S. and Arseno-Meth-Hyd (now sold as Solution of Arsenic and
Mercury). The preparations having been referred to a committee for consideration,
this committee reported:</p>


<h5>ARSENOVEN S. S.</h5>

<p>“Arsenoven S.&nbsp;S.” is a preparation put out by the S.&nbsp;S. Products Company,
Philadelphia. The claims are made that it is “a simplified office treatment
for syphilis” and is “a combination of arsenic and mercury for office use,
offering maximum efficiency, safety and convenience.” According to the company,
“Arsenoven S.&nbsp;S.” contains Dimethylarsenin 15.4 grains, Mercury biniodid
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain, Sodium iodid <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain. With regard to the identity of “dimethylarsenin”
the company claims: “This product is a compound of cacodylic acid
similar to sodium cacodylate but with a more pronounced therapeutic action.”
The committee recommends to the Council that “Arsenoven S.&nbsp;S.” be declared
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because of unwarranted therapeutic
claims.</p>


<h5>ARSENO-METH-HYD</h5>

<p>“Arseno-Meth-Hyd,” is sold by the New York Intravenous Laboratory,
New York City, for the treatment of syphilis. It comes in three dosages,
2&nbsp;gm., 1.5&nbsp;gm., and 0.7&nbsp;gm., respectively. The claim is made that “Arseno-Meth-Hyd
2&nbsp;gm.” contains “2&nbsp;gm. (31 grains) of Sodium Dimethylarsenate
(Cacodylate), U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.. and Mercury Iodid 5&nbsp;mg. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub></span> grain)” in 5&nbsp;c.c. of
solution. Physicians are told:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In primary and early secondary case administer Arseno-Meth-Hyd 2&nbsp;gm. every sixth day
and Mercury Oxycyanide .008 (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> grain) intravenously between each injection.”</p>

<p>“In Tertiary cases and those of long standing alternate with intravenous injection of
Sodium Iodid 2&nbsp;gm.”</p></div>

<p>The following claims are made for the alleged effectiveness and safety of
the cacodylate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This methyl compound of arsenic has come into almost universal use for syphilis. On
account of lack of toxicity an aggressive routine can be carried on. The simple technic and
absence of reactions make it most desirable for the regular practitioner. This large dose gives
more uniform results both as healing manifestations and negative Wassermann’s.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
<p>“Much discussion has surrounded the use of Methyl Compounds of Arsenic and it has been
demonstrated beyond doubt that Cacodylate of Soda proves an effective remedy for syphilis
provided that it is properly administered.” [sic]</p>

<p>“The low toxicity of this Methyl compound of arsenic is remarkable. It is contraindicated
only where a decided idiosyncrasy for even small doses of arsenic exists.”</p></div>

<p>These statements are essentially false and misleading. Cacodylate has <i>not</i>
come into universal use in the treatment of syphilis, nor has its usefulness
been “demonstrated beyond doubt.” On the contrary, H.&nbsp;N. Cole (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
Dec. 30, 1916, p.&nbsp;2012) has shown that doses so large as to produce renal injury
were almost totally ineffective against syphilis. Obviously, “effective doses”
if such exist, are not harmless. The dosage advised for Arseno-Meth-Hyd
may not produce acute toxic symptoms; nevertheless smaller doses have produced
nephritic phenomena. The “Arseno-Meth-Hyd” treatment includes the
intravenous injection of about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain of a mercury salt. Although this is
less than the usual dose (about 1 grain per week), the mercury is probably
more effective than the cacodylate.</p>

<p>The committee recommends to the Council that, because of the unwarranted
therapeutic claims, “Arseno-Meth-Hyd” be held inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p>The Council adopted both reports of the committee and declared “Arsenoven
S.&nbsp;S.” and “Solution of Arsenic and Mercury” (“Arseno-Meth-Hyd”) inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies. The committee’s reports on these
two products impel the Council again to call attention to the undesirable and
dangerous abuses to which “Intravenous Therapy” lends itself. There is a
distinct field for the intravenous administration of drugs in those cases in
which immediate drug action is necessary, or when the medicament is likely
to be changed if absorbed through the ordinary channels. Unless such indications
exist, however, intravenous administration involves not only inconvenience
and expense to the patient, but what is more important, unnecessary danger.
The fact that indiscriminate intravenous administration is peculiarly profitable
to certain manufacturing houses makes it all the more necessary for the
medical profession to be on its guard in this matter.</p>

<p>In this connection it is well worth while to quote the closing paragraph
from an editorial on “Intravenous Therapy” that appeared in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
Nov. 11, 1916. It is as true today as when it appeared:</p>

<p>“Intravenous therapy will be most securely advanced if its employment is
restricted to such well defined fields. [As those mentioned above.] These
fields can be satisfactorily determined only by a scientific pharmacologic study
of the action of these drugs when so administered in animals, as well as in
man, under conditions in which the results are carefully controlled. The
intravenous method is an impressive one, approaching in preparation almost
to that which goes with a surgical operation. The patient is usually interested
and impressed by this new, and, to him, mysterious method. There is
a psychic element in his reaction to the injection which is not a factor in
his reaction to the same drug when given by mouth. The intravenous injection
of a complex mixture would appear to be particularly reprehensible. Little is
known, as has been stated, of the results to be expected from intravenous
therapy, even with simple substances. The use of complex mixtures will
without doubt react against the proper use of the method.”</p>

<p>After the report on Arseno-Meth-Hyd had been presented to the Council,
a letter was received from the New York Intravenous Laboratory announcing
that the preparation “Arseno-Meth-Hyd” was now called “Solution of Arsenic
and Mercury” and expressing a desire to have its products accepted for inclusion
in New and Non­official Remedies. In view of this letter, the committee’s report
on “Arseno-Meth-Hyd” and the Council’s protest against promiscuous intravenous
<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>therapy were sent the New York Intravenous Laboratory for consideration.</p>

<p>The reply of the New York Intravenous Laboratory contained nothing which
permitted a revision of the preceding report. The change of the name of
“Arseno-Meth-Hyd” to “Solution of Arsenic and Mercury” means little as
the name still does not disclose the important fact that the arsenic is present
as sodium cacodylate, nor does it tell the character of the mercury compound.
The Council voted that “Solution of Arsenic and Mercury” and “Arsenoven
S.&nbsp;S.” be declared inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because the
therapeutic claims advanced for them are unwarranted (Rule 6) and because
the names of these pharmaceutical preparations are not descriptive of their
composition (Rule 8).</p>

<p>In filing its reply with the Council, the New York Intravenous Laboratory
announced that that document would be circulated to the medical profession.
This is of course the firm’s privilege. The Council notes, however, with interest,
that the reply is devoted almost entirely to points which were not raised by
the Council and that it fails to discuss the objections which were actually made.</p>

<p>The reply constantly confuses the efficiency of cacodylate in anemia and in
syphilis. The Council’s report on “Arseno-Meth-Hyd” does not discuss or even
touch on the question of cacodylates in anemia. It is confined to a discussion
of the disappointing results obtained with cacodylates as such (i.&nbsp;e., without
mercury) in the treatment of syphilis. This attempt on the part of the New
York Intravenous Laboratory to confuse the issue and to attribute to the
Council an opinion that it has never stated or held is an inexcusable misrepresentation.
The company in its reply said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We believe that you have previously stated that a solution cacodylate of soda possesses
no more action than so much water. In other words, it was inert. Now you try to show that
it produces renal injury.”</p></div>

<p>The Council has never declared that cacodylates are inert. In the report
it is merely stated “that doses so large as to produce renal injury were almost
totally ineffective against syphilis.” Neither has the Council stated that cacodylate
is “peculiarly dangerous.” In fact the absolute toxicity of cacodylates is
low but Cole’s results were quoted as a caution that “effective” doses are not
harmless. A great portion of the remainder of the reply is devoted to disparaging
arsphenamin&mdash;a product that is not involved in this action of the
Council, and one about which the physician is amply informed.</p>

<p>Amongst other wholly extraneous matters, the firm’s “reply” tried to resurrect
the pepsin pancreatin controversy. This also has nothing to do with the
efficiency or harmlessness of sodium cacodylate. In order to dispose of the
matter, however, it may be pointed out that the implications are entirely misleading.
The work which is quoted against the Council was undertaken by
the Council itself, to clarify obscurities in the older data. The outcome of these
new investigations showed the essential correctness of the deductions from the
older work, namely, that pancreatin is destroyed by pepsin-hydrochloric acid.
Dr. Long’s work to which the firm’s reply evidently refers, showed that under
favorable conditions, namely, when protected by an excess of protein, some
trypsin may escape destruction in the stomach; but it fully confirmed the
original conclusion that pepsin and pancreatin mixtures as ordinarily administered
are practically worthless (J.&nbsp;H. Long, <i>Jour. Amer. Pharmaco. Assoc.</i>,
Sept. 19, 1917).</p>

<p>As regards the editorial on intravenous therapy, a concession may be made
the New York Intravenous Laboratory: intravenous injections are no longer
quite as “impressive” as in 1916, but that does not alter the fact that they
should be used only when a distinct advantage is to be gained.&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 2, 1919</i>)</p>

<h3>HORMOTONE AND HORMOTONE WITHOUT POST-PITUITARY</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.</h4>


<p>“Hormotone,” of the G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company, is advertised as “A pluriglandular
tonic for asthenic conditions.” “Hormotone Without Post-Pituitary”
is recommended for use “in neurasthenic conditions associated with high blood
pressure.” These preparations are sold in the form of tablets for oral administration.
The Council declares these preparations inadmissible to New and
Non­official Remedies because: (1) Their composition is semisecret (Rule 1);
(2) the therapeutic claims are unwarranted (Rule 6); (3) they are sold under
names not descriptive of their composition but suggestive of indiscriminate
use as “tonics” (Rule 8); (4) in the light of our present knowledge the
routine administration of polyglandular mixtures is irrational (Rule 10). In
explanation of this action, the Council authorized publication of the report
which appears below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Each tablet of “Hormotone” (G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Co., New York City) is said
to contain <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain of desiccated thyroid and <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span> grain of entire pituitary,
together with the hormones of the ovary and testes&mdash;the amounts and the form
in which the latter are supposed to be present are not given. From this it will
be seen that the only definite information given to the medical profession
regarding the composition of Hormotone is that it is a weak thyroid and a
still weaker pituitary preparation.</p>

<p>What results can be anticipated from one or two tablets three times daily
(the recommended dose of Hormotone) each containing <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain of thyroid and
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span> grain entire pituitary? Such doses of thyroid may, of course, have a
beneficial action in a limited number of cases of myxedema and cretinism. An
extract of the posterior lobe of the pituitary (Liquor Hypophysis, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., for
example) will, <i>when injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly</i>, have a pronounced
effect on the parturient uterus; its action on certain other forms of
smooth muscle will be much less certain. But the <i>oral administration</i> (for which
Hormotone is recommended) of the posterior lobe of the pituitary has not been
shown to have any such effect. The use of the anterior lobe in doses of 1
to 4 grains (doses very many times larger than those recommended for the
entire gland in Hormotone) is in the experimental stage and its only probable
value seems to be in those cases of known gland deficiency.</p>

<p>As to the other alleged ingredients of Hormotone&mdash;hormones of the ovary
and testes, amounts not stated: all physicians know the uncertainties attending
the use of ovarian preparations and the serious question as to whether testicular
extracts have any therapeutic value. Whatever may be the physicians views
as to the probable therapeutic value of these organs, the first thing he desires
to know is how much of the substance he is giving and from what part of
the gland it is obtained.</p>

<p>So much for the facts; yet the physician is asked to jump from this region
of solid fact into a sea of hypothesis; to believe that small amounts of the
well-known drugs thyroid and pituitary, plus an unknown amount of unknown
hormones of the testes and ovary are of great value in conditions that in
themselves are often purely hypothetical. He is asked to believe that this combination
has virtues in such conditions as “hypofunction of the adrenal system,”
neurasthenia, the “fatigue syndrome,” amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, “natural and
artificial menopause,” sexual neuroses, cold extremities, cardiac asthenia, low
blood pressure, infantilism, sterility, melancholic conditions, obesity, anorexia,
anemia, slow metabolism, constipation, psychasthenia, lowered virility and the
sexual neuroses of the unmarried, hysteria following functional exhaustion of
the nerve centers, frigidity, etc., etc., especially if he guesses that the trouble
<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>is due to a “pluriglandular disturbance,” “glandular hypofunction,” an “adreno-pituitary
deficiency,” suboxidation, etc.</p>

<p>The physician is invited to use Hormotone because, among other reasons,
each alleged constituent is said to be “in physiologic sympathy and therapeutic
harmony with the others,” and further, because:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pluriglandular therapy has the endorsement of high authorities, is both logical and effective
and Hormotone is a splendid example of it. It will be seen at its best where the patient lacks
snap and vim and vigor. Asthenic conditions necessarily indicate hypofunction of the adrenal
system&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” etc.</p>

<p>“The use of gland extracts in the treatment of aplasias of the pluriglandular system has
become an established therapeutic measure of miraculous potency (Bayard Holmes: The
Internal Secretory Glands, <i>Lancet-Clinic</i>, Sept. 19, 1914).”</p></div>

<p>The G.&nbsp;W. Carnrick Company also advertises a “Hormotone Without Post-Pituitary,”
each tablet of which is said to contain <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain desiccated thyroid,
and to “present” “hormone bearing extracts of thyroid, anterior pituitary, ovary,
and testes.” This product is just as irrational as “Hormotone.”&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 16, 1919</i>)</p>

<h3>FORMALDEHYDE LOZENGES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has voted Hex-Iodin (Daggett and Miller Co., Inc., Providence,
R.&nbsp;I.), Formitol Tablets (E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co., Boston), and Cin-U-Form Lozenges
(McKesson and Robbins, New York City) inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, and authorized publication of the report which appears below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the Council published (<span class="smcap">The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</span>, Aug. 28,
1915, p.&nbsp;816) a report on Formamint, a proprietary medicine widely exploited as
a peculiar chemical compound of sugar of milk and formaldehyde. The formaldehyde
was said to be liberated slowly by the action of the saliva, and because
of this liberation of formaldehyde, Formamint was claimed to be a powerful
germicide. Extravagant claims were made for its curative and prophylactic
effects. The Council found that the therapeutic claims were grossly unwarranted
and that its exploitation to the public was a public danger.</p>

<p>During the recent epidemic of influenza, a variety of tablets or lozenges were
advertised, and are still being advertised, having formaldehyde, in some form
or other, as the nucleus around which revolve the therapeutic claims. In some
cases, the advertising clearly indicates the character of the formaldehyde
compound that is claimed to be present; in others the statements are vague
and indefinite or misleading.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remind physicians that the use of tablets containing
hexa­methylen­amin or other formaldehyde compounds can neither cure respiratory
infections, nor even confer protection against such infections. To be
effective, formaldehyde would need to be supplied to the entire respiratory
tract continuously for some time or else in concentrations that would be
distinctly irritant and damaging to the tissues. Saliva-dissolved tablets,
obviously cannot reach the nasal or tracheal mucosae directly; and the application
of quickly acting concentrations of formaldehyde is out of the question.
This altogether aside from the fact that hexa­methylen­amin, the basis of some
of these tablets, does not liberate formaldehyde in the mouth, and for this
reason alone would be quite useless for this purpose! (See Hanzlik and Collins,
<i>Archives of Internal Medicine</i>, November, 1913.)</p>

<p>An inefficient antiseptic is more than merely useless; it is a menace to
public safety, in that it tends to lead to the neglect of rational and effective
protective measures. It therefore seems advisable for the Council again to
<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>call the attention of physicians to the subject. Accordingly, three specimens
of these products were purchased and examined in the Association’s Chemical
Laboratory.</p>


<h4>Hex-Iodin</h4>

<p>Hex-Iodin (Hexamethylenetetramine and Iodum) Lozenges are manufactured
by Daggett and Miller Company, Inc., Providence, R.&nbsp;I. They weigh
15<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;grs. each, are sweetened and are flavored with mint or menthol. The
package and circulars do not contain a definite statement of composition. The
rather indefinite synonyms “Hexameth. and Iodine Comp.” and “Hexa­methylene­tetramine
and Iodum” suggest that the lozenges contain hexa­methylen­amin
and free iodin. The further statement that they “contain the combined medicinal
antiseptic and prophylactic properties of Hexa­methylene­tetramine and
Iodum” is also rather indefinite. The therapeutic action claimed for the
lozenges, however, could only be produced by free iodin and by liberated formaldehyde.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discuss in detail the extravagant claims made for these
lozenges. The inefficiency of hexa­methylen­amin has already been referred to;
the limitations of iodin, free or combined, in lozenge form, need not be discussed
because the examination made in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory showed
that Hex-Iodin lozenges contained no free iodin, and only traces of combined
iodin. Neither formaldehyde nor para­form­aldehyde was present; hexa­methylen­amin
was present but, the lozenges being neutral no formaldehyde is generated
in contact with water or with the alkaline saliva.</p>

<p>Thus Hex-Iodin is shown to be worthless for the purpose for which it is
advertised. Of the two important ingredients said to be present, iodin and
hexa­methylen­amin, only traces could be found of the former while the latter,
as has been shown, is incapable of exerting any effect when used as the manufacturers
direct.</p>


<h4>Formitol Tablets</h4>

<p>These tablets are prepared by the E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co., Boston. Each tablet
weighs 13<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;grs. They have the odor of thymol or menthol and an acid taste
and reaction. They are, according to the label:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the throat and mouth. Soothing, Astringent, Antiseptic. Rapidly destroys germs of
infection, preventing and relieving sore throat and mouth.”</p></div>

<p>In a circular, it is stated, that one of the qualities of Formitol:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. is the generation of formaldehyde when in contact with water or the saliva.”</p>

<p>“Besides generating formaldehyde, Formitol, Patch contains astringent, demulcent and
soothing ingredients which render the combination unusually effective.”</p></div>

<p>A bacteriologic report is given in this circular in which it is stated that,
in 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> minutes one Formitol Tablet rendered sterile a plate culture of a
“characteristic throat micrococci.” The instructions are to dissolve a tablet in
the mouth, slowly, once an hour or a half-tablet every half hour.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that Formitol Tablets contained
formaldehyde (or para­form­aldehyde), and ammonium compound, and
some hexa­methylen­amin. It is probable that the formaldehyde (or para­form­aldehyde)
was produced by the decomposition of hexa­methylen­amin originally
present in the tablets but decomposed by long contact with the acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_128_134" id="FNanchor_128_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_134" class="fnanchor">128</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span></p>
<p>These tablets differ from Hex-Iodin in that they really contain active formaldehyde
and, therefore, possibly produce antiseptic effect in test-tube cultures.
The conditions in the mouth, however, are very different from those in the
test-tube, since in the mouth the formaldehyde would be immediately “bound”
or absorbed. The claimed absence of irritation indicates sufficiently the
absence of efficient quantities of formaldehyde under clinical conditions.</p>


<h4>Cin-U-Form Lozenges</h4>

<p>Cin-U-Form Lozenges, manufactured by McKesson and Robbins, New York
City, are marketed in bottles of 24 for 25 cents. They have a strong odor
of cinnamon, weigh 15<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;grs. each, and are acid in taste and reaction. The
label states that they contain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cinnamon, Eucalyptus, Formaldehyde and Menthol&mdash;all powerful germicides against
Influenzal bacilli, but not injurious to the system in this palatable form.”</p></div>

<p>A circular contains the same statement as to composition and claims further
that they:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. help to prevent the infection of Spanish Influenza, Pneumonia, Grip Colds and
to guard against Sore Throat, Tonsillitis, Pharyngitis, etc.”</p></div>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that Cin-U-Form Lozenges
contained some formaldehyde (or para­form­aldehyde) and no hexa­methylen­amin.
It is obvious that the mouth and throat cannot be “disinfected” by these
lozenges. They would be totally ineffective against bacteria that enter through
the nose; they cannot prevent influenza, pneumonia, etc.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 4, 1919</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>LAVORIS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Lavoris was considered by the Council in 1913, and its proprietors&mdash;the
Lavoris Chemical Company&mdash;were advised that the preparation was inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies because of conflict with Rules 1, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
No report was published at that time. As the preparation is still widely advertised
to physicians, the Council has again examined Lavoris and authorized
publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>In recent years Lavoris has been widely advertised as “<span class="lowercase smcap">THE IDEAL ORAL
ANTISEPTIC</span>,” particularly to the dental profession. A printed card sent out by
the Lavoris Chemical Company in 1913 read: “<span class="lowercase smcap">LAVORIS</span>, the Pyorrhea Remedy.
The Original <span class="lowercase smcap">ZINC CHLORIDE</span> Mouth Wash. One grain zinc to each ounce.”
The card also gave a “formula” to the effect that each pint of Lavoris contained:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Zinc Chloride</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">1.040</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Resorcin</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.520</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Menthol</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.400</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Saccharin</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.195</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Formalin</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.195</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Ol. Cassia Zeyl</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.780</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Ol. Caryophyl</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">0.195</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Advertisements now appearing in medical journals repeat the older “formula”
except that resorcin is omitted. The formula while seemingly frank and
open is in reality indefinite and misleading in that no denomination of weight
is given for the various constituents. It is uncertain, for example, if the figures
in the formula are intended to represent grains, grams or percentages of the
several constituents. In view of the indefinite statement of composition, a
<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>chemical examination of Lavoris was undertaken in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical
Laboratory. The report of the laboratory follows:</p>

<p><i>Zinc.</i>&mdash;This was determined electrolytically. Fifty c.c. gave 0.026&nbsp;gm. zinc
and 100&nbsp;c.c. gave 0.0531&nbsp;gm. zinc. The average is 0.0526&nbsp;gm. zinc in 100&nbsp;c.c.
This is equivalent to 0.1102&nbsp;gm. anhydrous zinc chlorid in 100&nbsp;c.c.</p>

<p><i>Chlorid.</i>&mdash;After decolorizing some of Lavoris with chlorid-free animal charcoal,
the chlorid was determined by the Volhard method. Twenty-five c.c.
Lavoris required 4.328&nbsp;c.c. tenth-normal silver nitrate solution equivalent to
0.01535&nbsp;gm. chlorid (chloridion) or 0.0614&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c. A second 25&nbsp;c.c. of
Lavoris required 4.112&nbsp;gm. tenth-normal silver nitrate solution equivalent to
0.01458&nbsp;gm. chlorid (chloridion) or 0.05832&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c. Average is 0.05985&nbsp;gm.
This is equivalent to 0.1150&nbsp;gm. zinc chlorid in 100&nbsp;c.c. This agrees closely
with the foregoing zinc determination.</p>

<p><i>Resorcin.</i>&mdash;The method of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia was used. The total
bromin absorption of 25&nbsp;c.c. Lavoris was 3.68&nbsp;c.c. tenth-normal bromin solution.
This would be equivalent to 0.00675&nbsp;gm. resorcin in 25&nbsp;c.c. or 0.02700&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c.
In a duplicate test, 25&nbsp;c.c. Lavoris required 3.8&nbsp;c.c. tenth-normal bromin
solution equivalent to 0.00697&nbsp;gm. resorcin or 0.02788&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c. Since oil of
cinnamon absorbs bromin, 50&nbsp;c.c. of Lavoris was boiled until very little or no
odor of the oil was noted, keeping the volume nearly constant by adding a
little water from time to time, and the bromin absorption then taken. In one
experiment, 0.36&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal bromin solution was consumed, and in a
duplicate no bromin was absorbed. This shows the absence of resorcin.</p>

<p><i>Residue.</i>&mdash;On evaporating 25&nbsp;c.c. Lavoris on a steam bath and subsequent
drying of the residue at 100&nbsp;C., 0.0455&nbsp;gm. of residue was obtained. This is
equivalent to 0.1820&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c.</p>

<p><i>Saccharin.</i>&mdash;Saccharin was detected in the residue and ether-extract of the
residue by its intense sweet taste when a little sodium bicarbonate was added
to it.</p>

<p><i>Formaldehyd.</i>&mdash;This could be detected by the Jarrison test. The color was
not very pronounced and the quantity of formaldehyd was small.</p>

<p><i>Oil of Cinnamon.</i>&mdash;The odor and taste of Lavoris is characteristic of cinnamon.</p>

<p><i>Menthol and Oil of Cloves.</i>&mdash;The odor of menthol and of oil of cloves
could not be detected, but no tests were made to demonstrate their presence.</p>

<p>The analysis thus indicates that the Lavoris of today contains no resorcin
but does contain a small amount of formaldehyd, a little saccharin, and oil of
cinnamon (menthol and oil of cloves could not be detected by the odor, but
were not tested for). The analysis showed that the principal constituent of
Lavoris is zinc chlorid, of which there is about 0.1&nbsp;gm. per 100&nbsp;c.c. (about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>
grain to the ounce).</p>

<p>The amount of zinc chlorid given in the published formula, i.&nbsp;e., 1.04, is
meaningless because the unit of weight or measure is not given; furthermore,
the analysis shows that it is inaccurate for any unit of weight that might
be assumed from the published figures. Since the amount of the most active
medicinal ingredient is both indefinite and inaccurate, the composition of the
preparation is essentially secret. Lavoris is indirectly advertised to the public
by having included in the package a circular giving a list of diseases for
which the preparation was recommended. The combination of zinc chlorid,
formaldehyd and oil of cinnamon (assuming the menthol and oil of cloves to
be present as flavors) in a mixture is irrational and likely to lead its users
to ascribe a false and exaggerated value to the preparation. The name is
objectionable in that it does not indicate the composition of the potent ingredients
of the mixture, but instead suggests its use as a mouth wash.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span></p>
<p>From a standpoint of public safety, the most serious objection to Lavoris,
however, lies in the many unwarranted therapeutic claims and suggestions. It
is generally held that zinc chlorid solutions which possess a strength of from
1 to 200 up to 1 to 500 exercise a weak antiseptic action. The strength of
zinc chlorid in Lavoris is approximately 1 to 1,000. The directions for its use
recommend that Lavoris should be diluted. A dilution of 1 to 4 is recommended
for a variety of mouth conditions while for cystitis irrigations and as a
vaginal douche, it is recommended that one tablespoonful be added to a quart
of warm water or salt solution. The strength of zinc chlorid in the last
suggested dilution would approximate 1 to 64,000. It is evident that no
antiseptic action could be expected from such dilutions.</p>

<p>The recommendation that diluted Lavoris be used for the treatment of
coryza, nasal catarrh, hay fever, inflamed eyes, hemorrhoids and leucorrhea is
objectionable and irrational. Especially dangerous is the recommendation that
members of a family exposed to diphtheria or scarlet fever should use Lavoris
freely as a preventive. Such recommendations can but give a false sense of
security and lead to the neglect of proved methods for preventing the spread
of these diseases. Equally unwarranted is the recommendation that in gonorrhea
one teaspoonful of Lavoris to eight of warm water be used with a blunt
end syringe.</p>

<p>The use of Lavoris as recommended would not only prove valueless in
many instances but might lead to serious consequences because really valuable
methods of prevention or treatment might be neglected. For these reasons the
preparation is in conflict with Rule 6.</p>

<p>The Council declared Lavoris ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>MEDINAL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on Medinal
(Schering and Glatz, Inc.).</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Medinal is a proprietary name applied to barbital sodium (sodium diethyl­barbiturate)
the sodium salt of barbital (di­ethyl­barbituric acid). The latter
was first introduced as Veronal.</p>

<p>Medinal was deleted from New and Non­official Remedies in 1916 because
the advertising issued by Schering and Glatz (who then acted as agents for
Chemische Fabrik auf Actien vorm. E. Schering, the German manufacturer)
contained misleading and unwarranted therapeutic claims. The Council did
not publish its report because by the time the report was ready for publication
the product was practically off the American market, and it was hoped that
when Medinal again became available, Schering and Glatz would revise the
claims and thus permit its reacceptance.</p>

<p>Medinal, said to be manufactured in the United States, is now marketed
by Schering and Glatz, Inc. In October, 1918, the firm sent to the Council
a typewritten copy of a proposed circular for Medinal. The firm was informed
that this leaflet was subject to the objections that had been raised when
Medinal was deleted from New and Non­official Remedies. In April, 1919,
the firm submitted a printed circular which it was sending out. This contained
numerous misleading statements, among them, these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Medinal</span> removes its [Di­ethyl­barbituric acid] one objectionable feature&mdash;insufficient solubility&mdash;and
thus fulfills the three prerequisites of a truly rational hypnotic: Quick absorption,
insuring prompt action, rapid and complete excretion, affording protection from cumulative
toxic after effects, and the choice of rectal and subcutaneous administration.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span></p>
<p>There is no justification for the claim that diethylbarbituric acid (barbital)
has only one objectionable feature and that a minor matter of “insufficient
solubility.” The Council has called the attention of Schering and Glatz, Inc.,
to the fact that the difference in the time of absorption between Medinal
(barbital sodium) and barbital is, at the most, but one of minutes and that
there is no evidence that Medinal is excreted more rapidly than barbital.
Hence the claims that the danger of toxic side-actions and that cumulative
after-effects are avoided in this product, are wholly unwarranted.</p>

<p>It is also claimed, and the claim is unsupported by satisfactory evidence,
that Medinal is useful in the insomnia of tuberculosis in which condition it is
said to have a double advantage owing to its favorable effects on the night-sweats.
It is claimed that Medinal is used in the withdrawal treatment of
morphin addiction with great success; there is no evidence that Medinal has
any special usefulness in this treatment of the morphin habit. It is claimed
further that success has been reported with Medinal in the treatment of whooping
cough. The Council knows of no satisfactory evidence to show that Medinal
is of special value in whooping cough; on the contrary, it is capable of doing
a great deal of harm. The recommendations that Medinal be used for the
control of labor pains and in acute neuralgic pains that resist other forms of
treatment are wholly unwarranted as the value of the drug in such conditions
is inherently improbable and until satisfactory evidence in support of them is
forthcoming, must be deemed misleading.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov.

<h3>OMISSION OF COTARNIN SALTS (STYPTICIN AND STYPTOL)
FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Salts of the base cotarnin have been used as local and systemic hemostatics.
The hydrochlorid was first introduced as “Stypticin,” and is now in the
pharmacopeia as cotarnin hydrochlorid (<i>Cotarninae Hydrochloridum, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.</i>).
The phthallic acid salt of cotarnin&mdash;cotarnin phthallate&mdash;was introduced as
“Styptol.” Both Stypticin and Styptol were admitted to New and Non­official
Remedies. In 1918 the Council voted to omit Stypticin because the former
American agents were no longer offering it for sale. Styptol was retained and
is described in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1919.</p>

<p>As was pointed out in the description (N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1918), the evidence for
the usefulness of the cotarnin salts has been contradictory and unsatisfactory;
but since the available data against the efficiency were at least equally unreliable,
the Council deemed it best to retain them in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. pending a thorough
investigation of the subject. This was undertaken by P.&nbsp;J. Hanzlik, at the
suggestion of the Therapeutic Research Committee of the Council.</p>

<p>A reliable judgment of hemostatic efficiency can be formed only on a basis
of strictly controlled conditions, which can best be furnished in the laboratory.
Hanzlik repeated the principal experiments published by previous investigators,
and applied a number of new or improved methods. The results (published in
the <i>Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics</i> <b>10</b>:523, 1918;
<b>12</b>:71, 1919) show the following:</p>

<p><i>Direct Application to Wounds.</i>&mdash;The widely quoted results of the gynecologist
K. Abel, on the footpad of cats, were found to be quite unreliable. When the
experiment is properly controlled, the results are either negative or the bleeding
may be increased. Quantitative experiments on wounds of the footpad of dogs
<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>showed that cotarnin invariably <i>increased</i> the bleeding. Equally negative or
unfavorable results were obtained with wounds to the comb of roosters, and
to the liver and spleen.</p>

<p><i>Direct Action on Vessels.</i>&mdash;The results of perfusion experiments were variable,
but, in general, showed a vasodilation action instead of constriction. This
holds true also of the uterine vessels. The vessels in the living animal (rabbit’s
ear) were also unaffected.</p>

<p><i>Systemic Administration.</i>&mdash;The bleeding from an irrigated wound was not
modified directly by intravenous injection of cotarnin salts, but varied merely
with the state of the blood pressure.</p>

<p>The evidence for the inefficiency of cotarnin salts as hemostatics seemed
so conclusive as to warrant the Council in rescinding the acceptance of Styptol,
and directing the omission of the general article on cotarnin salts and the
description of Styptol from New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 22, 1919</i>)</p>

<h3>MICAJAH’S WAFERS AND MICAJAH’S SUPPOSITORIES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>“Micajah’s Medicated Wafers” and “Micajah’s Suppositories,” sold by
Micajah &amp; Co., Warren, Pa., are declared inadmissible to “New and Non­official
Remedies” because (1) their composition is essentially secret (Rule 1); (2)
name of neither of these mixtures is indicative of its composition (Rule 8); (3)
of exaggerated and unwarranted therapeutic claims (Rule 6), and (4) the
therapeutic advice which accompanies the trade packages constitutes an indirect
advertisement to the public (Rule 4).</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Micajah’s Medicated Wafers (formerly called “Micajah’s Medicated Uterine
Wafers”) were analyzed in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory in 1910. They
were found to consist essentially of dried (“burnt”) alum, boric acid and borax,
in approximately the following proportions:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Alum, dried</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">59.86&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Borax, dried</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">15.62&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Boric acid</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">&#8199;5.67&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Water of hydration</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">18.85&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There are a number of drugs that are more or less effective in the treatment
of local lesions of mucous membranes and the skin. They are classed as
astringents. Among these are included alum, borax and boric acid. Every
physician has used them. To say that a wafer consists of alum, borax and
boric acid inspires but little awe. But there is something much more mysterious
and impressive in declaring that a wafer “consists of an astringent and antiseptic
base, in which are incorporated certain medicaments which both locally
and after absorption, contribute to the astringent, antiphlogistic, depletive,
soothing and healing action of the product.” This gives the impression that
some powerful and almost incomprehensible factors are at work. Yet, after
all is said and done, the substances contained in Micajah’s Medicated Wafers
are just the homely old alum, boric acid and borax.</p>

<p>In addition to “Micajah’s Medicated Wafers,” Micajah &amp; Co. also put
out “Micajah’s Suppositories for Hemorrhoids.” These have been examined
in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory and, like the “Medicated Wafers” have
been found to contain alum, boric acid and borax&mdash;and these substances practically
alone&mdash;incorporated in cocoa butter. The company claims that “to these
have been added Ammonii Ichthyo­sulphonate, Balsam of Peru, Ext. Belladonae.”
The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. chemists report, however, that if extract of belladonna is present
<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>at all it is in amounts too small to be detected by the method commonly
employed in the chemical examination of alkaloidal drugs. The chemists
report further that while ammonium ichthyo­sulphonate and balsam of Peru
both have a decided odor and are dark in color, the suppositories have but
little color and the odor of the cocoa butter that forms their base is not covered
by these drugs; obviously, therefore, if ammonium ichthyo­sulphonate and balsam
of Peru are present at all it is in amounts utterly insufficient to exert any
therapeutic effect.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find better examples of mischievous proprietary medicines
than these two products of the Micajah Company. “Twins of Efficiency,” they
are called in an advertising pamphlet. The composition is not stated. A
physician using the “twins” does so absolutely in the dark. To him they are
secret preparations. He is encouraged to use them in a great variety of conditions
in which other drugs are much more useful. Inevitably, physicians
using them will be likely to overlook, or pass over, new growths, specific
infections and diseases that require radical remedial measures.</p>

<p>In addition to misleading and exaggerated claims, there is a reference to
a report from the usual “well-known and reliable bacteriological laboratory.”
The excerpts published from this report of an unnamed laboratory are sufficiently
vague to incriminate no one.</p>

<p>From time to time it is worth while to emphasize facts regarding proprietary
medicines that while obvious are sometimes forgotten. For this reason attention
is directed to Micajah’s Uterine Wafers and Micajah’s Suppositories.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>ALKALITHIA</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Alkalithia was introduced at a time when it was believed that the administration
of lithium salts served to remove uric acid from the system. The
product was considered by the Council in 1906, and found ineligible for New
and Non­official Remedies. No report, however, was published at that time.</p>

<p>Because of inquiries received, the Council examined the current claims
for Alkalithia, and authorized publication of the report which appears below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Keasbey and Mattison Company’s Effervescent Alkalithia is sold with the
following statement of composition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Each dose or heaping teaspoonful contains 1 grain of Caffeine, 10 grains each of Bi-carbonates
of soda and potash, and 5 grains of Carbonate of Lithia.”</p></div>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports that Alkalithia is an effervescent
mixture which contains alkaline carbonates and bicarbonates together with
caffein, free tartaric acid and free citric acid. The major portion of the
alkali carbonates and bicarbonates is converted into citrates and tartrates
when the preparation is dissolved in water&mdash;as is done before it is taken. An
excess of alkali is present, however, as the solution has an alkaline reaction.
Each “heaping teaspoonful” (which was found to be about 4.85&nbsp;Gm.) contains
about 0.044&nbsp;Gm. of caffein (the manufacturers claim 0.0648&nbsp;Gm. per heaping
teaspoonful). As taken, Alkalithia, therefore, represents caffein in a solution
of alkali tartrate, citrate and bicarbonate containing free carbonic acid. If
it is assumed that all of the tartrate and citrate in Alkalithia is converted
into carbonate in the organism, a “heaping teaspoonful” of Alkalithia would
represent about 2.9&nbsp;Gm. of sodium bicarbonate. This assumption is, however,
<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>not correct, for it is known that tartrates are not completely converted into
carbonates in the organism.</p>

<p>According to the label on the bottle, this mixture of caffein and alkali
salts is “a common sense remedy for the relief and treatment of conditions
dependent upon perverted metabolism as manifested by neuralgic, rheumatic,
cardiac and renal symptoms.” Wrapped with a trade package is a circular
in which is discussed the “uric acid diathesis” as “a cause of Rheumatism
in its various forms, Calculus, Gravel and Inflammation of the Bladder and
Kidneys, Asthma, Hay Fever, Catarrh, Quinsy and Bronchitis, Eczema, Hives,
Itching and Burning of the Skin, Palpitation of the Heart and Cold Hands
and Feet, Dizziness, Mental Depression, Melancholia, Neuralgia, Chorea,
Hysteria, Numbness and a great variety of purely nervous symptoms.” The
arguments for the use of Alkalithia as “a safe and scientific treatment for the
uric acid diathesis” found in the circular constitute an indirect appeal to the
laity (conflict with Rule 4).</p>

<p>In the circular matter sent direct to the physicians, Keasbey and Mattison
claim that in rheumatism, Alkalithia is prescribed by the medical profession
more often than any other remedy. The claim is made that, “In five minutes
the urine will be discolorized and analysis will show it to be loaded with
urates.” The manufacturers further assert:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You can change the character of the urinary secretion in a few minutes completely” by
Alkalithia, and “In nine cases out of ten, when the doctor prescribes ‘Alkalithia’ his patient
greatly improves, or gets well.”</p></div>

<p>The firm advises that “Renal Insufficiency” be determined by the old method
of multiplying the ounces of urine in twenty-four hours by the last two numbers
of the specific gravity, adding 10, which gives the number of grains of solids
excreted in the twenty-four hours. If this is low, no matter what the cause,
they advise Alkalithia, “that ideal eliminant.”</p>

<p>The Council declared Alkalithia inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
because the claims made on the label and the circular accompanying the
trade package lead the public to its detriment to depend on this preparation
(Rule 4); and because the therapeutic claims are unwarranted (Rule 6).&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;65</i>)</p>

<h3>ARHOVIN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Arhovin is a solution of dephenylamine, thymol benzoate and ethyl benzoate,
marketed by Schering and Glatz, Inc. It was omitted from New and Non­official
Remedies because the therapeutic claims made for the preparation were
unwarranted and because the firm had refused to discontinue the distribution
of the advertising which contained the objectionable claims prior to Jan. 1,
1919. When the report which appears below explaining the dismissal was submitted
to Schering and Glatz, Inc., the firm again promised a revision of its
advertising, but refused discontinuance of the objectionable circular before
Jan. 1, 1920. Since Arhovin is still marketed with unwarranted therapeutic
claims, the Council has authorized publication of this report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The attention of the firm Schering and Glatz, Inc., was called to misleading
statements in its booklet for Arhovin in 1915, and in 1918 the firm was informed
that unless the misleading statements were withdrawn before Jan. 1, 1919,
Arhovin would be omitted from New and Non­official Remedies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span></p>
<p>The following quotations are taken from the circular in question, and illustrate
the character of the claims to which objection was made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Striking also is the antiphlogistic and anesthetic effect of Arhovin on the inflamed mucosae,
an effect which, as all authorities agree, is far greater than that of all other internal anti-gonorrheaics.”</p>

<p>“Under its influence vesical and prostatic complications, gonorrheal arthritis, endocarditis,
etc., are rarely incurred.”</p></div>

<p>References to the indexes of leading textbooks, including those of Meyer
and Gottlieb, Cushny, Sollman and Bastedo, fails to show that Arhovin is
so much as mentioned by those authors; hence, it is obviously false to state, as
is done in the first of the quotations above, that all authors agree concerning
the striking effects of Arhovin.</p>

<p>Many of the statements are objectionable by reason of the actions implied,
rather than stated directly. The following are examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Arhovin in Gonorrheal Infections of the Male Genito-Urinary Organs. Anterior Urethritis.
This is the class of cases in which the most favorable results from Arhovin have been reported.”</p>

<p>“Posterior Urethritis.</p>

<p>“Here also the striking effects from Arhovin medication, both in acute and chronic cases,
are rapid decrease of discharge, disappearance of gonococci from the secretion, and cessation
of subjective difficulties, such as strangury.”</p></div>

<p>While the firm did not agree to withdraw the objectionable advertising
before Jan. 1, 1919, which made necessary the omission of Arhovin from New
and Non­official Remedies, 1919, it did submit a proposed folder in which the
most objectionable of the claims are still made.</p>

<p>The following statement, which was in the proposed “folder” and is included
in an advertising pamphlet sent out during 1919, serves to illustrate those points:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Its action is three-fold:</p>

<p>“Strong antiseptic and bactericidal effect upon the urethral and vesical mucosae, highly
conducive to shortening and palliation of the acute disease course.”</p></div>

<p>No evidence has been presented that Arhovin is capable of destroying the
gono­coccus in the urethra, and consequently, the Council declared the recommendation
for the use of Arhovin in the treatment of gonorrhea, by means of
claims such as those just cited, is both misleading and dangerous.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;66</i>)</p>

<h3>CHLORON, CHLORAX AND NUMBER “3”</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The report which appears below was sent to the Chlorine Products Company,
Inc., May 14, 1919. In reply to an inquiry sent the Chlorine Products
Company, July 8, the company wrote that it could send no reply because the
medical director was still in France. However, Chloron and Chlorax are
being advertised in medical journals; also essentially the same advertising as
that discussed in the report was recently received by a physician from the
Chlorine Products Company.</p>

<p>The preceding facts having been reported to the Council, publication of the
report was authorized.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Chloron, Chlorax and Number “3” are preparations of essentially similar
composition put out by the Chlorine Products Company, Inc., New York.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span></p>

<h4>Chloron</h4>

<p>Chloron, according to the label, is “A stable <span class="lowercase smcap">CHLORINE</span> remedy for the reduction
of inflammation, relief of pain and for all wounds, burns, scalds and every
description of sores except cancer and lupus.” Its composition is given as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Free chlorine, 0.200 per cent.; calcium chloride, 0.190 per cent.; mercurous chloride,
0.030 per cent.; lithium chloride, 0.035 per cent.; calcium hydrate, 0.010 per cent.; water to
100 parts.”</p></div>

<p>The Council asked the manufacturers for further information in regard to
the composition or preparation of Chloron and received this reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Chlorine gas is prepared in the usual way and purified and passed into water until a
saturated solution is made.</p>

<p>“Water to the extent of three times the volume of the chlorine solution is used to dissolve
the necessary amount of calcium chloride, and the two solutions are mixed.</p>

<p>“The necessary amounts of Lithium and Mercurous Chloride are then intimately mixed and
made into solution. This solution is then added to the above and the whole is agitated for
some minutes.”</p></div>

<p>A specimen of Chloron was examined in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical laboratory
and the chemists reported:</p>

<p>Qualitatively the presence of the following constituents was confirmed: calcium,
mercury, lithium, chlorid, free chlorin. The solution was alkaline. Of
course, the declaration that Chloron contains mercurous chlorid (calomel) is
obviously incorrect, as mercurous chlorid cannot exist in a solution containing
active (free) chlorin, but is oxidized to mercuric chlorid (corrosive sublimate).
As the solution was alkaline in reaction, it seemed unlikely that all the active
chlorin was present in the free state, as declared on the label. Quantitative
determination of free chlorin and of total active (“available”) chlorin gave:
free chlorin, 0.036&nbsp;gm. per hundred c.c.; total “available” chlorin, 0.330&nbsp;gm.
per hundred c.c., or 165 per cent. of the claimed amount.</p>

<p>A comparison of the information sent to the Council with the analytic
findings leads to the conclusion that Chloron is not of reliable composition.</p>

<p>As evidence of the therapeutic value of Chloron, the following “case reports”
were submitted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a case of second degree burn involving the most of one leg from the middle of the
calf down, <span class="smcap">Chloron</span> was the only dressing used. The burn was a bad one and the patient
in a rundown anaemic condition, at no time was there any appearance of pus, the surface
looked clean and bright and the healing was accomplished with practically no scar whatever.
The burn was kept wet with the solution by hourly applications day and night. The skin
which has grown on the wound is clear, healthy and firm.</p>

<p>In another case of Varicose veins of long standing, the result was surprising. The patient
told of two years vibrating from Hospital to Hospital and getting no real relief. Each leg had
large open running sores, the only dressing used was wet compresses of this solution. The
pus disappeared at once, the wound began to cicatrise from the edges and in two weeks the
man was discharged from the hospital practically cured.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Chloron</span> was recently tried at the &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; Hospital on cases presenting ulcers and
other sores which did not readily yield to other methods, with good results, in fact were of an
indolent type. In these cases <span class="smcap">Chloron</span> proved very valuable.”</p>

<p>“I have used <span class="smcap">Chloron</span> on a series of cases (surgical) presenting pus foci and I have
found the application very beneficial and healing, the pus early disappearing. In cases of
Osteomyelitis, Suppurating Arthritis, Cellulitis and Chronic Ulcers, <span class="smcap">Chloron</span> is particularly
valuable, its good effects quickly observed and the time of restoration to health shortened.”</p></div>

<p>In the first case report, there is no evidence that Chloron is more efficient
in the treatment of burns than any other commonly used procedure might have
been. In the case of the varicose ulcers, while there was some apparent benefit
from Chloron, no credit is given to rest and the general treatment which is
known to be important in the treatment of such conditions. The evidence
in the other case reports is quite inconclusive. Consideration of the “case
reports” leads to the conclusion that clinical evidence for the value of Chloron
is lacking.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span></p>
<p>Attention should be called to the fact that the amount of active chlorin,
claimed to be present in Chloron as well as the amount found by the association
laboratory, is less than that considered effective by Dakin, Dunham and others;
seemingly in preparing Chloron no attention has been paid to the degree of
alkalinity, yet the importance of this factor is now generally recognized.</p>

<p>Chloron fails to comply with the requirements for surgical solution of
chlorinated soda (N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1919, p.&nbsp;133), yet the manufacturers make free
use of the text of Dakin and Dunham’s Handbook of Antiseptics in their advertising
pamphlet. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="box1 vat">

not ap­pear likely to be found, but on the
other hand it is sur­pris­ing to see how lit­tle
dam­age may be done to ani­mal tis­sues by
some ac­tive anti­sep­tics. An im­por­tant me­thod
of judg­ing of the in­juri­ous ac­tion of anti­sep­tics
is to in­ves­ti­gate the con­di­tion of the
leuco­cytes in wounds re­cent­ly treat­ed with
the sub­stance under con­si­der­ation. In gener­al
it appears from ex­peri­ments <i>in vitro</i>
that, with the strength of anti­sep­tics com­mon­ly
used in sur­gery, mer­cury salts and
hypo­chlor­ites have rela­tive­ly lit­tle ef­fect on
phago­cyt­osis as com­pared with phe­nol (Parry
Morgan). It is a regu­lar phe­nom­enon to ob­serve
ac­tivi­ty of the leuco­cytes ob­tained from
wounds which have been re­cent­ly treat­ed with
hypo­chlor­ites.</p>

<p>Ingenious methods for determin­ing the in­flu­ence
<i>in vivo</i> of anti­sep­tics on the ac­tivi­ties
of leuco­cytes have been worked out by Col.
C.&nbsp;J. Bond.</p>

<p>“In addition to their dis­in­fect­ing ac­tion,
the Chlorine anti­sep­tics are strong oxi­diz­ing
agents and de­odor­ants and more­over pos­sess
in high de­gree the pro­perty of de­com­pos­ing
toxins. By the re­gu­lat­ed ac­tion of hypo­chlor­ous
acid, Dean has pre­pared a non­toxic
dys­entery vac­cine and it is a com­mon ob­ser­va­tion
that the free use of hypo­chlor­ites
may re­duce the con­sti­tu­tion­al symp­toms aris­ing
from sep­tic pro­ces­ses and that they re­ap­pear
on dis­con­tinu­ing the anti­sep­tic treat­ment.”</p></div></div>


<h4>Chlorax</h4>

<p>Chlorax is said to be “A stable <span class="lowercase smcap">CHLORINE</span> solution for internal use,” in
“Kidney Conditions,” “Diabetes,” “Acute Infections,” “Blood Dicrasias,” “Lithemias
and Rheumatism,” and “Nervous Conditions.” It is claimed to have the
same composition as that of Chloron with the addition of 0.016 per cent. of
tincture of opium.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that the free chlorin in
Chlorax was 0.01&nbsp;gm. per hundred c.c. and the total amount of active (“available”)
chlorin was 0.25&nbsp;gm. per hundred c.c., or 125 per cent. of the amount
claimed. The laboratory notes that though the chlorin content of Chloron
and Chlorax is claimed to be the same, that of Chlorax actually is less. This
is not surprising when the presence in Chlorax of reducing substances such
as alcohol is borne in mind. The laboratory concludes that Chlorax is not of
reliable composition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span></p>
<p>The following is typical of the “case reports” submitted to show the value
of Chlorax:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In January last I used Chlorax on a case of Diabetes Mellitus and with excellent results.</p>

<p>“The patient had been suffering for about nine years and when first brought to my care
Toxemia had set in, he was drowsy, irritable and unable to leave the house. I prescribed
Chlorax in teaspoonful doses four times a day and am pleased to say that in one week he
showed marked improvement. Soon after he was able to leave the house and attend to his
business and after two months’ treatment resumed a normal diet and habits apparently without
injurious effects.</p>

<p>“I believe that in this case Chlorax undoubtedly prolonged life.”</p></div>

<p>No mention is made of the dietary or other measures used. The wide
variation in diabetes and its response to proper diet is so well known that
the noncommittal statement concerning the beneficial effects of Chlorax amounts
to no evidence at all in favor of the preparation.</p>

<p>The other “case reports” furnished by the Chlorine Products Company, Inc.,
which concern the treatment of gastric ulcers, acute alcoholic gastritis, tonsillitis,
etc., are equally unconvincing. In fact, no satisfactory evidence for the
clinical value of Chlorax has been presented.</p>

<p>The following from the advertising for Chlorax is unwarranted and absurd:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mercurous chloride (calomel) is perhaps the most widely used internal antiseptic and
alterative and has established itself in the therapy of constipation, cholera, dysentery, cardiac
dropsy, pleurisy, malignant fever, malaria, syphilis, worms, infectious diseases, gout and
rheumatism; lithium chloride is particularly efficacious in acute and chronic parenchymatous
nephritis and in various lithemic conditions; while Opium has no rival as an anodyne and
can be used to stabilize and conserve the alkaline reserve of the body against the acidosing
influence of infections.”</p></div>

<p>Further, on page 14 we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In chills and fever malaria and other blood dicrasias, <span class="smcap">Chlorax</span> is indicated as an internal
antiseptic and it exerts a beneficial effect on the course of these diseases.”</p></div>

<p>The claims made for Chlorax are exaggerated and misleading.</p>


<h4>Number “3”</h4>

<p>According to the label, Number “3” is “<span class="lowercase smcap">A STABLE CHLORINE</span> remedy for the
purification of the blood,” with the composition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Free Chlorine, 0.35 per cent.; Calcium Chloride, 0.30 per cent.; Mercurous Chloride, 0.03
per cent.; Lithium Chloride, 0.04 per cent.; Calcium Hydrate, 0.01 per cent.; Opium, 0.02
per cent.; Ethyl Alcohol, 0.10 per cent.; water to 100 parts.”</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the composition claimed for Number “3” is essentially
similar to that claimed for Chloron. It differs from Chloron in that the
amounts of some of the constituents are somewhat greater, and in that, like
Chlorax, it contains some tincture of opium.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports that the free chlorin in a
specimen of Number “3” was 0.024&nbsp;gm. in 100&nbsp;c.c. and the total active (“available”)
chlorin 0.173&nbsp;gm. per hundred c.c., or about 50 per cent. of the claimed
amount. The examination indicates that Number “3” is of unreliable composition.
The Chlorine Products Company, Inc., submitted no clinical evidence
for Number “3” to which it refers as “our Syphilis remedy.” It stated that
two physicians had used the preparation “with good results,” and admitted that
“the company requires further evidence before pushing it.”</p>

<p>The Council declared “Chloron,” “Chlorax” and “Number ‘3’&#8239;” in conflict
with the rules governing admission to New and Non­official Remedies. All
are of unreliable composition (conflict with Rule 1). The therapeutic claims
made for the preparations are not substantiated by acceptable evidence and are
unwarranted and misleading. Chloron is inferior as an antiseptic to the well-known
<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>surgical solution of chlorinated soda on account of its low chlorin content
and uncontrolled reaction. There is no warrant for the claim that Chlorax is
useful in the treatment of “Kidney Conditions,” “Diabetes,” “Acute Infections,”
“Blood Dicrasias,” “Lithemias and Rheumatism,” and “Nervous Conditions,”
nor is there warrant for the claim that “Number ‘3’&#8239;” is a remedy for the
purification of the blood or a “Syphilis remedy” (conflict with Rule 6).</p>

<p>The names of these pharmaceutical mixtures are not descriptive of their
composition (conflict with Rule 8).</p>

<p>All three preparations are irrational. No evidence has been furnished
that the lithium salt is of value in the mixtures. It is not rational to combine
an active chlorin preparation and a mercury salt in one mixture, nor is there
evidence that the addition of opium to the preparations proposed for internal
use is of value or rational. Experimentation with Number “3” as a “Syphilis
remedy” is to be severely condemned in that those on whom it is used will in
the meantime be deprived of efficient medication (conflict with Rule 10).&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>ELARSON OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report announcing
the omission of Elarson from New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Elarson, now sold by the Winthrop Chemical Company, Inc., was formerly
sold in the United States by the Bayer Co., Inc. It was admitted to New and
Non­official Remedies in 1914.</p>

<p>The circular issued by the Winthrop Chemical Co. contains several statements
markedly at variance with the results of an investigation made, at the
request of Fischer, by Joachimoglu (<i>Arch. f. exper. Path. u. Pharmakol.</i>
<b>78</b>:1914). The circular states that Elarson contains about 13 per cent. arsenic.
Joachimoglu found from 10.8 to 11.1 per cent. to be present. The circular
states further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact that Elarson represents a lipoid-like chemical combination of arsenic has an
important bearing upon its absorption and utilization in the system <span class="ell">..</span>. there is good
reason to believe that when arsenic is administered in a stable, lipoid-like combination, as in
Elarson, it is more readily taken up by the cells and more completely utilized than when given
in the customary manner.”</p>

<p>“As regards the behavior of Elarson in the system, it has been shown that its active constituent,
chlorarseno-behenol, is almost completely absorbed in this form, probably as a chlor-behenolate
of sodium or potassium.”</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, Joachimoglu found that very little arsenic was absorbed
when Elarson was given to dogs and rabbits; most of it was recovered from
the feces; only traces were found in the liver and kidneys and none in the
blood and brain. The absence from the latter organs shows that the lipoid
solubility does not obtain in the body. It is claimed in the circular that
Elarson has the advantage over Fowler’s solution “in that it is free from any
irritating action upon the gastro-intestinal tract”; it is stated that as many as
sixty tablets have been given to dogs daily without any toxic effects. Joachimoglu,
on the other hand, found powdered Elarson to be very irritating to the
gastro-intestinal tract; also that the dog could not stand sixty tablets at all
(<i>gar nicht vertragen</i>), such doses causing vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal
hemorrhages; on repeated administration the symptoms became progressively
more severe. Joachimoglu also found that, compared on the basis of arsenic
content, Elarson, given intravenously, is from ten to twelve times as poisonous
<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>as arsenic trioxid. Elarson is recommended for the class of cases in which
Fowler’s solution is used.</p>

<p>To sum up: None of the special claims made for Elarson&mdash;the arsenic
content, ready absorbability, freedom from irritating action on the gastro-intestinal
tract and its alleged better adaptation for continued administration&mdash;have
been substantiated; on the contrary, they have been disproved as well as the
theory of its mode of absorption proposed by Fischer and Klemperer. Furthermore,
Joachimoglu found that when it actually got into the circulation
(intravenous injection) in the form in which Fischer and Klemperer supposed
it to be absorbed, it was from ten to twelve times as toxic as arsenic trioxid.</p>

<p>The Council voted to omit Elarson from New and Non­official Remedies
because it is sold under unproved and consequently unwarranted claims and
because it is an unscientific and relatively useless article. Elarson has not been
shown to have advantages over Fowler’s solution; on the contrary, in some
respects at least, it is inferior.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;75.</i>)</p>

<h3>IODIPHOS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>A report which appears below was sent Charles L. Heffner for consideration.
No reply having been received, the Council authorized its publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Iodiphos, marketed by Charles L. Heffner, Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y., is declared to
contain ferric citro-iodine, 6 grains; calcium glycero­phosphate, 8 grains; sodium
glycero­phosphate, 8 grains, and hypophosphorous acid, 2 minims in each fluidounce,
and to present “the Metallic and Non-Metallic elements: Iron, Iodine,
Phosphorous, Calcium and Sodium (each in separate Basic combination).”</p>

<p>According to the label, Iodiphos is “<span class="smcap">Alterative</span>, <span class="smcap">Tonic</span>, <span class="smcap">Nervine</span> and <span class="smcap">Anti-tubercular</span>”
and is “For Treatment of BLOOD, NERVES and PULMONARY
ORGANS.” An advertising <span class="nowrap">circular<a name="FNanchor_129_135" id="FNanchor_129_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_135" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> asserts that “Iodiphos exerts its Physiological
action rapidly in hardening of the Arteries, High Blood Pressure,
Anaemia, Glandular Swelling, Neurasthenia, Hypochondria, Phthisis, Bronchitis,
Asthma, Pneumonia and as an Intestinal Antiseptic and Appetizer,” and declares
it to be “Indispensable as a Tonic and Restorative.”</p>

<p>In the advertising circular it is averred that in the production of Iodiphos
“Chemistry Again Aids the Modern Physician.” Iodiphos is another instance
when a decadent polypharmacy proposes haphazard medication and so obstructs
the efforts of modern medicine to establish the use of single drugs to meet
definite indications.</p>

<p>Iodiphos is inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because it is
an irrational mixture of drugs sold with therapeutic claims that are unwarranted,
and under a name which is not descriptive of its composition.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;81.</i>)</p>

<h3>MERVENOL AND ARMERVENOL NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the report which appears below
declaring Mervenol and Armervenol, marketed by the Hille Laboratories, inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span></p>
<p>Mervenol is stated by the proprietors&mdash;The Hille Laboratories, Chicago&mdash;to
be a hydrosol (colloidal suspension) of the sulphides of mercury and copper,
containing sufficient sodium chloride to make it isotonic with blood serum,
and “inert proteid” and “carbohydrate” to stabilize the colloidal suspension:
each cubic centimeter is stated to contain 0.005&nbsp;gm. mercury, 0.0016&nbsp;gm. copper,
and 0.0016&nbsp;gm. sulphur.</p>

<p>It is claimed that this preparation is of value in pneumonia, influenza, and
other conditions and diseases requiring increased leukocytosis.</p>

<p>It is further claimed that the properties and therapeutic effects of this preparation
are as follows: “Practically non-irritant; practically non-toxic; lower
temperature, often crisis like; lower pulse, with better elimination; greatly
accelerated recovery from Influenza; fewer Pneumonia complications; lower
mortality rate in Influenza and Pneumonia; remarkable Leucocyte stimulation.”
Administration by mouth and by intramuscular and intravenous injection are
advocated.</p>

<p>In the recent influenza epidemic, it is reported that therapeutic results of
some value were obtained at the Great Lakes Training Station and at Fort
Sheridan. The reports of certain medical officers indicate that this preparation
seemed to have some effect on the course of pneumonia and influenza, on the
temperature, and on the leukocyte count. But those conducting the experiments
state that it was “absolutely impossible” to fulfil ideal conditions as to controls
and other observations at the time the experiments were conducted.</p>

<p>So far as the Council knows, no effort has been made to determine the
potent constituent, or constituents, of this preparation; whether the mercury,
the copper, or the protein in the mixture was responsible for the claimed benefits
is an open question.</p>

<p>These reports were given careful consideration, but it was decided not to
accept this preparation because of (1) exaggerated therapeutic claims, conflicting
with Rule 6 (aside from the report of its use in influenza and pneumonia at the
Great Lakes Training Station and the Post Hospital at Fort Sheridan, which
reports are of work done and observations made under conditions which did not
permit careful controls, no evidence has been presented to the Council supporting
the therapeutic claims) and (2) being an irrational mixture, conflicting with
Rule 10&mdash;a mixture containing colloidal mercury, copper and sulphur with
proteins and carbohydrates in addition, it is difficult to predict the changes
which occur in such mixtures on standing.</p>

<p>Samples of Mervenol (two 1-ounce bottles) submitted by the manufacturer,
June 5, 1919, were found when opened, Aug. 18, 1919, to have undergone
decomposition. A very disagreeable odor had developed, the liquid was turbid,
and a large amount of precipitate had formed.</p>

<p>Armervenol is stated by the proprietors&mdash;The Hille Laboratories, Chicago&mdash;to
be a hydrosol (colloidal suspension) of “mercury-copper-sulpharsenite” containing
sufficient sodium chlorid to make it isotonic with blood serum and
“inert proteid” and “carbohydrate” to stabilize the solution: each cubic centimeter
is declared to contain 0.0025&nbsp;gm. arsenic, 0.005&nbsp;gm. mercury, 0.0016&nbsp;gm.
copper, and 0.0032&nbsp;gm. sulphur.</p>

<p>The use of Armervenol as advised by the Hille Laboratories is the same
as that of Mervenol, and in addition its use in syphilis is emphasized. The
criticisms of this mixture are similar in every respect to those directed against
Mervenol&mdash;the addition of arsenic introduces still another factor of uncertainty.</p>

<p>After investigating these claims, it was decided not to accept this preparation
on the ground (1) that the therapeutic claims are unproved and unwarranted,
conflicting with Rule 6, and (2) that the mixture is an irrational one, conflicting
with Rule 10.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919,

<h3>NORMAL PHENOL SERUM (CANO) AND METHYL-PHENOL
SERUM (CANO) NOT ACCEPTED FOR N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following statement declaring Normal Phenol
Serum (Cano) and Methyl-Phenol Serum (Cano) ineligible to New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>No statement of the composition of these preparations was submitted to the
Council and none appears on the labels of the trade packages. However, the
advertising circular contains statements such as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. normal phenol serum&mdash;phenol with methyl blue dissolved in anaphylactic
serum&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. a combination of human or horse serum with Phenol and Methylene-blue, thereby
forming a new chemico-biologic product which he termed Methyl-phenol Serum or, chemically,
Chloride of Phenol Thionin Tetra­methylene-Seric.”</p>

<p>“Methyl-phenol Serum is a chemico-biological product in which Phenol is the chief factor.
Each ampule of 10&nbsp;c.c. contains the therapeutic equivalent of 0.5&nbsp;gm. (7.5 grains) of Phenol.”</p></div>

<p>From the foregoing it appears that both preparations contain phenol and
methyl­thionine chloride (methylene blue) and that the second does not contain
methyl phenol (cresol) as the name would indicate.</p>

<p>No definite evidence for the value of these preparations is brought forward
and even the manufacturer is constrained to caution, “We assume no responsibility
for the therapeutic action of the serum<span class="ell">...</span>.” On the other hand
there are a great many statements in the papers of Cano and his colleagues to
which exception must be taken. Of these, from among many similar, the
following statements are to be cited and commented on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Accepting that the gonorrheal infection gives systemic toxemia from absorption of the
toxins&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>It is the general opinion that in the majority of instances there is no systemic
toxemia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The technique of intraprostatic injection, while less simple than that of the intravenous,
is by no means so difficult or complicated as to place it exclusively in the category of the
urologist.”</p></div>

<p>This obviously is an attempt to encourage the general use of these preparations
and to minimize the necessity for careful study and special skill in their
employment. It is most unwise for one to attempt intraprostatic injections
unless he is specially trained in the technique of this procedure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This injection to be performed after the 5th or 6th intravenous injection of Methyl-phenol
Serum<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Intravenous injections have a place in sane therapy only when the medicament
to be so administered is of known composition and when evidence is available
which gives assurance that definite results shall follow its use. In the
absence of these conditions it is manifestly unwise and even unexcusable to
employ any medicament in this manner, and its repeated use is reprehensible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Intravenous injection of Methyl-phenol Serum alternating with intravenous injections of
mercury should be given every 48 hours until infection is under control.”</p></div>

<p>This quotation further emphasizes that the treatment, as advised, carries
with it a certain element of danger.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Methylene blue prevents the phenol from exerting its usual action upon the red blood
corpuscles, and ensures rapid elimination through healthy kidneys. It preserves the antiseptic
power of the phenol and prevents the phenol from interfering with the chemico-biological
<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>function of the white and red blood cells. The serum component favors chemotaxis, it
strengthens bodily defense, it prevents anaphylaxis even in debilitated patients, and it replaces
the resistance which has been impaired by the demands that have already been made upon it.”</p></div>

<p>No evidence is submitted to substantiate these claims. It seems strange
that phenol should lose its power and that this should be restored by the
methylene blue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has a refractory chemico-biological action, and exercises no vicious effect on the red
blood corpuscles in the circulation, but, on the contrary, by its inoffensive presence, it wholly
preserves all of the physiological properties of the blood.”</p></div>

<p>What “a refractory chemico-biologic action” is, is not clear, but there is no
evidence that this preparation has any action which might be defined as “refractory
chemico-biological,” that its presence is inoffensive or that it wholly preserves
all the physiologic properties of the blood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The treatment of gonorrhea by Cano’s theory <span class="ell">..</span>. is firmly based upon chemico-biological
facts and accepted authoritative theories and bears the same relation to gonorrhea
that intravenous injections of arsenicals bear to syphilis.”</p></div>

<p>Quite an exaggerated and unwarranted statement. In the same way, objection
is taken to the following quotations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Phenol administered intravenously in combination with methylene blue, to protect the
red-blood globule, undergoes no change, and preserves all of its actual antiseptic effect on the
gono­coccus and its toxins as though employed in the test tube.”</p>

<p>“When thus introduced into the human body its elimination is unique, effective, antiseptic,
germicidal, being completely and exclusively thrown off through the kidneys in a period varying
from one-half to twelve hours without local injury or disturbance to the general economy.”</p>

<p>“Combinations of phenol are unstable, but they do have the advantage of mitigating direct
action on the cells and globules. It is also known that ordinary phenol has a <i>coagulant action</i>
on the albumins and an <i>oxidizing power</i> on the tissues, which power, if permanent, produces
gangrene. By virtue of this dual action it therefore acts as a <i>modifier</i>; by its oxidizing power
on the germ it is germicidal, and prevents the growth of the gono­coccus; and by its coagulant
power on the toxins it relieves para­gono­coccal lesions (mono- and poly-arthritides) and affections
of the serous organs (endo- and pericarditis, meningitis), and some definite systemic
disturbances, the pathology of which is often confused with that of other infections.”</p>

<p>“Lymphocytosis is often persistent in some individuals in whom the internal secretions and
the processes of assimilation and disassimilation are deficient; and because of the lack of these
the organic physiological ferments are insufficient for the mechanism of nutrition and the
phenomena of hematopoiesis.”</p></div>

<p>Until proof is available showing that phenol, administered intravenously in
the quantities employed in Cano’s Normal Phenol Serum and Cano’s Methyl-Phenol
Serum, acts as a germicide and methyl­thionine chloride (“methylene
blue”) prevents the deleterious effects of phenol on the red blood corpuscles;
that repeated intravenous injections of phenol and mercury are without danger;
that there is no danger of anaphylaxis; that the physiologic properties of the
blood are preserved by these medicaments; and, finally, that these preparations
have an effect on gonorrhea and its complications, these substances Normal
Phenol Serum (Cano) and Methyl-Phenol (Cano), are inadmissible to New
and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>The following quotations taken from the circular are admissions that these
preparations are not innocuous:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That the economy will tolerate to a surprising degree substances directly introduced
through the blood stream is now well known. By the intravenous injection of 10&nbsp;c.c. of
methyl-phenol serum we throw into the human body a massive dose of an alien substance.
The immediate effect of this injection is upon the central nervous system. The recipient
usually becomes either pale or suffused, he has a ringing in his ears, has a sensation of great
altitude, and occasionally has a dryness of the fauces and a metallic or a garlic taste.”</p>

<p>“In some patients secondary reactions occur in from one to four hours after injection.
The phenomena we have observed in these secondary reactions are pronounced chill and
rigor&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span></p>
<p>There is no doubt that considerable harm may be done by the intravenous
and by the intraprostatic administration of these preparations and until there
is good evidence showing the therapeutic value of the treatment, the routine use
of these preparations, except perhaps at hospitals in selected and well controlled
and carefully guarded cases, is to be strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>When the foregoing statement was sent to the Mulford Company for comment,
the firm submitted a letter from Dr. Perry Townsend to the Mulford
Company in which he declared that the results obtained with the Cano preparations
had been satisfactory and without untoward results. In this letter, Dr.
Townsend proposed that a series of injections with these preparations be carried
out under the observation of members of the Council and the supervision of
Dr. Cano or himself.</p>

<p>The report of the Council, the letter from the Mulford Company and that
of Dr. Townsend were sent to a number of urologists for their opinion concerning
this whole matter. It was explained that the referee held that no
reason had been presented which would warrant the Council to depart from
its customary procedure, namely, to require that clinical evidence be submitted
in the form of published reports which permit investigation and verification
by independent observers but that, before making further recommendation to
the Council, he desired the opinion of urologists of recognized standing concerning
the report submitted to the Mulford Company. All replies received
approved the Council’s position.</p>

<p>The following is one of the replies received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your letter in regard to Normal Phenol Serum (Cano) and Methyl-Phenol Serum (Cano)
received. I wish to state that I have read the correspondence between the Council and H.&nbsp;K.
Mulford Co. and in my opinion the referee and the Council are quite correct in their attitude
in the matter. In my opinion I would emphasize the following:</p>

<p>(1) There is absolutely nothing about the remedies directed <i>specifically</i> against the gono­coccus
and no evidence to show that any action against them is obtained. As we know there
are certain states of normal serum which are highly toxic and any normal serum from another
animal will produce disturbances in man when injected intravenously&mdash;particularly if repeated.
The addition of substances to serum normal or otherwise is apt to and frequently does render
that serum highly toxic! The substances added in the instances referred to&mdash;phenol and
methylene blue are not in any way calculated to lessen the toxicity of serum. The element of
danger existing in the indiscriminate use of serums intravenously is, in my opinion, increased
by the addition of the substances mentioned, and it would be unwise to encourage the general
use of any such remedies. Furthermore the products are condemned by the very evidence
of the originators and their admissions are quite sufficient to deter anyone from using the
products as they suggest.</p>

<p>As to the intraprostatic injections with the serums it does not at all meet my views;
although the introduction of serums by this route have been frequently advocated and I have
personally carried this mode out I cannot allow the impression to go out that it could be done
in a routine manner&mdash;nor that no ill results could follow&mdash;for I have seen otherwise. Furthermore
from theoretical standpoint serums need not be given in this way.</p></div>

<p>In consideration of the opinion expressed by the Council’s consultants the
referee recommended that Normal Phenol Serum (Cano) and Methyl-Phenol
Serum (Cano) be declared ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies because
of conflict with Rule 6 (unwarranted therapeutic claims) without considering
possible conflicts with other rules, and that publication of the report be authorized.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>SOAMIN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Soamin is the name under which the firm of Burroughs Wellcome and
Company sells its brand of sodium arsanilate. The Council directed the
omission of Soamin from New and Non­official Remedies and authorized
<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>publication of the report which appears below after the proprietors of the
product had declined to withdraw or suitably revise the unwarranted therapeutic
claims which it made.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The proprietary brand “Soamin” of sodium arsanilate was admitted to New
and Non­official Remedies several years ago at a time when the therapeutic
value of arsanilic acid had not been definitely determined. Experience with
this drug has shown that it is far more dangerous and also has a more limited
field of usefulness than was at first recognized. The proprietors of the Soamin
brand have continued to include in the list of conditions in which it “would
seem” to be a “very effective agent” cerebrospinal meningitis and pellagra;
in fact, meningitis is the first in the list of conditions mentioned, syphilis the
second and pellagra third. In support of their belief in the efficacy of the remedy
in meningitis, three reports, published from six to nine years ago, are
quoted. In one of these it is stated that two patients “were cured”; in another
report, seven of eight patients in whom the clinical, but not the microscopic,
diagnosis of meningitis had been made were reported as having recovered; in
the third report, fifty-six of ninety cases were reported cured; in this larger
series of cases the author neglects to state the method of administration. The
firm quotes but one paper (which is a very uncritical report) in regard to
pellagra.</p>

<p>It seems to the Council that the evidence of value of sodium arsanilate in
these conditions (which are now treated by more rational methods) is too
slight to justify the emphasis laid on it by the firm, especially as sodium arsanilate
is admittedly a dangerous agent, several cases of blindness having been
reported from its use.</p>

<p>For these reasons it was voted to omit Soamin from New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;89.</i>)</p>

<h3>SOME MIXED VACCINES NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The consideration of the following “mixed” vaccines was requested by
F.&nbsp;I. Lackenbach, San Francisco:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 2 (Staph-Strep. Bacterin) containing killed <i>Staphylo­coccus
albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i> and strepto­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 3 (Pneumo-Staph-Strep. Bacterin) containing killed <i>Staphylo­coccus
albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>, strepto­coccus and pneumo­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 4 (Pneumo-Staph-Strep-Coli Bacterin) containing killed
<i>Staphylo­coccus albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus citreus</i>, <i>Bacillus coli</i>, strepto­coccus
and pneumo­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 5 (Influenza Combined Bacterin) containing killed <i>Staphylo­coccus
albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus Friedländer</i>, <i>Bacillus influenzae</i>, <i>Micro­coccus
catarrhalis</i>, strepto­coccus and pneumo­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 11 (Pneumo-Strep. Bacterin) containing killed strepto­coccus
and pneumo­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 15 (Combined Whooping Cough Bacterin) containing killed
<i>Bacillus pertussis</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>, <i>Micro­coccus catarrhalis</i>, <i>Bacillus
influenzae</i>, strepto­coccus and pneumo­coccus.</p>

<p>Special Bacterial Vaccine No. 16 (Mixed Gono­coccus Bacterin) containing killed gono­coccus,
<i>Staphylo­coccus albus</i>, <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus coli</i>, <i>diphtheroid bacillus</i>, strepto­coccus
and pneumo­coccus.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lackenbach states that these bacterial mixtures were prepared for him
by E.&nbsp;R. Squibb &amp; Sons. Their sale in interstate commerce is permitted under
<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>the license granted to the latter firm by the U.&nbsp;S. Treasury Department. However,
no evidence of any kind was presented to the Council proving the therapeutic
efficacy of the several mixed vaccines. As a mixture of two or more
kinds of organisms is accepted for New and Non­official Remedies only if there
is satisfactory evidence that its therapeutic use is rational, the Council declared
the several vaccine mixtures ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies (Rule
10).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;90.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>SOMNOFORM</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council examined the available evidence for Somnoform, sold by
Stratford-Cookson Company, successors to E. de Trey and Sons, and found the
preparation inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies. The Council
authorized publication of the report which appears below.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Somnoform is sold in the United States by Stratford-Cookson Company,
successors to E. de Trey and Sons. According to the label on a package of
Somnoform sent the Council.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This mixture contains Chloride of Ethyl, 83 per cent.; Chloride of Methyl, 16 per cent.;
Bromide of Ethyl, 1 per cent.”</p></div>

<p>Although Somnoform has been on the market for a long time, the published
reports present no proof that it is superior to ethyl chlorid used alone. Moreover,
the published reports and statistics do not necessarily apply to the
Somnoform now sold for the reason that mixtures of varying composition have
been sold as Somnoform in the past. Thus, when Somnoform was considered
by the Council in 1909, it was claimed to be composed of chloride of ethyl, 60
per cent.; chloride of methyl, 35 per cent., and bromide of ethyl, 5 per cent.
Federal chemists found, however, that it contained no bromide of ethyl (Notice
of Judgment No. 571). It is a question, therefore, whether a given report
applies to a mixture containing 5 per cent. bromide of ethyl, 1 per cent. of this
substance, or none at all.</p>

<p>The present advertising booklet for Somnoform does not present acceptable
evidence of the therapeutic value of the preparation. An ignorance concerning
the elementary facts of physiology and pharmacology is evident in the second
sentence: when having stated that “Somnoform is the result of several years
of study and investigation by Dr. George Rolland, Dean of the Bordeau Dental
School,” the pamphlet continues: “He sought an anesthetic which would enter,
dwell in, and leave the body in the same manner that oxygen does<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>The claim as to the value of the 1 per cent. of ethyl bromide in the mixture
is highly improbable; certainly no evidence in support of the claimed value of
this constituent is available to the referee.</p>

<p>No evidence is submitted which proves the claim of superiority of Somnoform
over similar preparations, asserted in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The peculiar manner in which the elements are combined is what makes Somnoform at
once so efficient and so safe.”</p></div>

<p>The Council declared Somnoform inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because, in the absence of acceptable evidence showing its exceptional
safety and value, the claims are unwarranted (Rule 6), and because the name
of the mixture is not descriptive of its composition (Rule 8).&mdash;(<i>From Reports
of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1919, p.&nbsp;90.</i>)</p>

<h3>TABLETS FORMOTHALATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report which
declares Tablets Formothalates (Tailby-Nason Company, Boston, Mass.)
ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Tablets Formothalates are sold by Tailby-Nason Company, Boston, Mass.
On the label a formula is given: “Constituents: Acetanilid 2&nbsp;gr.; phenol­phthalein
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;gr. In a balanced combination with Hexamene [a name sometimes applied
to hexa­methylen­amin] and Oil of Cinnamon. Indications: Influenza, Colds,
Grippe, Headache, Neuralgia, Rheumatism.” The same formula is given in
advertisements and in this advertisement it is claimed that they are “For
Influenza and Grip” and if “given in the acute stage may avert a serious
attack” (<i>Boston M.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S.&nbsp;J.</i>, Oct. 3, 1918). The dose is given as one to two
tablets at 6&nbsp;p.&nbsp;m. and repeat at bedtimes.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that the tablets weigh an
average of 0.4882&nbsp;Gm., or 7<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains; that they <i>have</i> the odor and taste of
cinnamon; and that they contain hexa­methylen­amin, are neutral and therefore
give up no formaldehyde in the presence of water alone. The Laboratory
further reported that they contain phenol­phthalein and acetanilid. These
tablets were directed to be taken internally and therefore their effect was not
intended to be local.</p>

<p>The amount of hexa­methylen­amin was not determined, but in any case
could not exceed 5 grains per tablet. It is evident that 4 grains of acetanilid
and 10 grains of hexa­methylen­amin and 1 grain of phenol­phthalein (in two
tablets) “if given in the acute stage” of influenza would not “avert a serious
attack,” as claimed in the advertisements.</p>

<p>The Council declared Tablets Formothalates inadmissible to New and
Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,

<h3>TRIPLE ARSENATES WITH NUCLEIN</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has declared Triple Arsenates with Nuclein No. 1 and Triple
Arsenates with Nuclein No. 2, tablets marketed by the Abbott Laboratories,
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because unwarranted therapeutic
claims (Rule 6) are made for them and because they present an illogical
combination of drugs (Rule 10). The publication of the following report has
been authorized by the Council.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The following claims are made for Triple Arsenates with Nuclein:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Puts ‘pep’ and strength back into that patient recovering from Spanish Influenza, pneumonia,
typhoid, or surgical operation. An extremely powerful reconstructive tonic. Try it
for that ‘run down’ feeling.”</p></div>

<p>Triple Arsenates with Nuclein is said to contain “Strychnin Arsenate gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>128</sub></span>,
Quinin Arsenate gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span>, Iron Arsenate gr.&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span>, Nuclein Solution mins.&nbsp;4.”
A second preparation, of double strength&mdash;Triple Arsenates with Nuclein No.
2&mdash;is also advertised. The Council voted not to accept these preparations for
New and Non­official Remedies on the following grounds:</p>

<p>The quantities of quinin, iron and nuclein in the doses represented in these
mixtures are negligible; thus, one tablet of Triple Arsenates with Nuclein
containing <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> grain of quinin arsenate contains only about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>90</sub></span> grain of
anhydrous quinin; the tablet containing <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub></span> grain of iron arsenate contains
<span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span><span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>210</sub></span> grain of iron; 4 minims of the nuclein solution (assuming it to be the
“Nuclein Solution-Abbott”) would contain but <span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub></span> of a grain of nuclein&mdash;a substance
which even in large doses is of questionable therapeutic value. The
amounts of iron and nuclein contained in doses of this preparation are insignificant
in comparison with the amounts present in ordinary foods. The only
substances present in even small therapeutic doses are strychnin and arsenic.
The effects of arsenic and strychnin are very different and there are comparatively
few conditions in which they should be prescribed at the same time.
Hence a preparation containing these two in fixed proportions is illogical.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>“ANTI-PNEUMOCOCCIC OIL” AND THE USE OF
CAMPHOR IN PNEUMONIA</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted and authorized publication of the report which
appears below. This report declares “Anti-Pneumo­coccic Oil” (a solution of
camphor in oil sold by Eimer and Amend, New York) ineligible for New and
Non­official Remedies because (1) the recommendations for its use in pneumonia
are not warranted by the evidence, (2) the name is not descriptive of
its composition but is thera­peutically suggestive, and (3) the sale of a solution
of camphor in oil under a name nondescriptive of its composition is unscientific
and a hindrance to therapeutic progress.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The Council having decided to consider Anti-Pneumo­coccic Oil (Eimer and
Amend, New York), the preparation was assigned to the Committee on Therapeutics
for report. The report that follows was made by a member of this
committee:</p>

<p>According to the advertising, Anti-Pneumo­coccic Oil is a “twenty-five per
cent. solution of camphor in a thin oil” which was “originated” by August
Seibert, M.D. The following directions are given for its use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“10&nbsp;c.c. (150 minims) to every 100 pounds of body weight, to be injected hypodermically
every eight to twelve hours in pneumo­coccic pneumonia, as soon after the initial chill as
possible.”</p></div>

<p>It is claimed that the prescribed dose one hour before general anesthesia
begins, “safeguards against postoperative pneumonia,” and, that “animals can
so be immunized against later and otherwise fatal intravenous pneumo­coccic
infection (Boehnke, Institute for Experimental Therapy, Frankfort).” The
advice is given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In pneumo­coccic meningitis, endocarditis and pleuritis, 3% of salicylic acid should be added
to this oil.”</p></div>

<p>In an article by Seibert, “Camphor and Pneumococci” (<i>Medical Record</i>,
April 20, 1912), a reprint of which is used to advertise Anti-Pneumo­coccic
Oil, previous work (<i>München, med. Wchnschr.</i>, No. 36, 1909) is mentioned
as the starting point for the use of camphor in pneumonia. In this article,
the author reports his first case, that of a young woman who entered St.
Francis’ Hospital on the third day after the initial chill “with the symptoms
of severe toxemia (unconscious, temperature 105.5&nbsp;F., pulse 130, and respiration
40) and involvement of both lower lobes.” “Large doses of camphor,” 12&nbsp;c.c.
of a 20 per cent. solution, were injected hypodermically “every twelve hours,
resulting in <i>gradual</i> improvement and recovery by the fourth day, without a
crisis.” Seibert reports success in its use in twenty-one cases, but gives no case
<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>histories or protocols. He admits, however, that in four out of sixteen cases,
following the first twenty-one so reported certain “limitations of this treatment
were observed,” and a “sudden rise of temperature in two patients on the
second and third days of treatment, respectively, proved to be due to pneumo­coccic
nephritis, promptly subdued by appropriate doses of urotropin, while the
camphor injections were continued and resulting in speedy recovery.” He
further admits that empyema occurs, and states: “This proves that the camphor
brought into the blood cannot prevent the as yet living organisms, constantly
entering the blood current from the affected alveoli, from colonizing in the
renal and pleural tissue.”</p>

<p>He reports, among thirty-seven patients treated in this manner, one death,
that of a man 68 years old, weighing 200 pounds, with a fatty heart. Heart
failure was the real cause of death. Seibert also reports some very incomplete
experimental work; Dr. Hensel, assistant and pathologist of the German
Hospital, found that “<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10,000</sub></span> part of camphor added to the usual culture media
inhibited the growth of pneumococci, while the controls all thrived”; Dr. J.&nbsp;C.
Welch, pathologist of the Lying-in Hospital, found that rabbits infected with
lethal doses of pneumo­coccus cultures intravenously were saved by large doses
of camphorated oil; fragmentary protocols are given. The assistant pathologist
of St. Francis’ Hospital carried on the experimental work, adding salicylic
acid to the camphor. No blood cultures are reported. The conclusion reached
by Dr. Seibert is that salicylic acid up to 3 per cent., added to the camphorated
oil, is effective in preventing pleural infection. In the article by Dr. Seibert,
there appear most sketchy reports of cases, recovery being reported without
crisis in from three to nine days.</p>

<p>The referee has made a careful search of the literature, with the following
results: Boehnke (<i>Berl. klin. Wchnschr.</i> <b>50</b>:818, 1913), using white mice, failed
to confirm the experiments reported in Seibert’s paper, unless camphorated oil
were given before the pneumococci, and even then, he felt that the results were
too irregular to be of great significance. When given with anti-pneumo­coccic
serum, however, he felt that there was some benefit to be seen by the administration
of camphor; his protocols, however, are not detailed. There is no report
of blood cultures, etc.</p>

<p>Another worker, H. Leo (<i>Deutsch. med. Wchnschr.</i> <b>39</b>:690, 1913), reported
that camphor water given intravenously prolonged the lives of thirty-eight
rabbits inoculated with pneumococci. Here again there were no adequate protocols
and very little evidence of careful experimental work appears.</p>

<p>In the literature of the past ten years, there appear sketchy clinical articles
on the value of huge doses of camphor in pneumonia. Markevitch (<i>Russk.
Vrach</i>, June 27, 1914; abstr., <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Dec. 5, 1914, p.&nbsp;2081) treated 226
cases of pneumonia with 5&nbsp;c.c. of camphorated oil hypodermically four times
daily, at the same time giving digitalis (amount not stated), with a mortality
of 6.6 per cent., whereas, in 322 cases untreated, there was a mortality of
13.3 per cent. He reports 133 grave cases; sixty-six received no camphor;
48 per cent. died. Of sixty-seven treated with camphor, only 22 per cent. died.
He reports temperature falling by lysis when camphor is used, and comments
on the symptomatic improvement following its use. With the great variation
in the clinical course of pneumonia, the above figures, though suggestive, certainly
need further support before the routine use of camphor as recommended
by Seibert can be sanctioned.</p>

<p>Later articles found on the subject refer to it in a very cursory way, giving
no protocols and no cases, and giving the referee the feeling that the conclusions
were very impressionistic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span></p>

<h5>RÉSUMÉ</h5>

<p>After a careful search of the literature, the referee concludes that: Huge
doses of camphor, to 250 grains in twenty-four hours, may be given to man
without serious results. No satisfactory evidence, however, appears that camphor
has a specific germicidal action on pneumococci (similar to that of ethyl­hydro­cuprein).
The clinical evidence, as found in the literature, is certainly of very
little value. It appears that the sale of a simple solution of camphor in oil
under the guise of “Anti-Pneumo­coccic Oil” is to be deplored (a 20 per cent.
solution of camphor in cottonseed oil is official in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia as
camphor liniment). It is recommended that the preparation be held inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies because exaggerated therapeutic claims are
advanced for it, and because the name is not descriptive of the composition, but
is, instead, thera­peutically suggestive.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 3,

<h3>DIAL “CIBA”</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Dial “Ciba” has not been accepted for “New and Non­official Remedies”
because, as the report which follows shows, unwarranted claims are made for
the product. It is a definite new chemical compound which might be made
eligible for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. if misleading therapeutic claims were eliminated. The
Council directed that Dial “Ciba” be included with Articles Described but Not
Accepted, so that physicians might be informed with regard to its character
and properties.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Dial “Ciba” is a hypnotic manufactured by the Society of Chemical Industry
of Basle, Switzerland, and is sold in the United States by A. Klipstein and
Company, Inc., New York. Chemically, Dial “Ciba” is di­allyl­barbituric acid
and is, therefore, closely related to di­ethyl­barbituric acid or barbital (“veronal”).</p>

<p>The claims made for Dial “Ciba” are (1), that the “allyl” group in its
molecule makes it more readily decomposed by oxidizing agents than barbital,
which contains the “ethyl” group; (2) that because of this ease of oxidation,
it is more readily decomposed in the body and more rapidly and completely
eliminated, and (3) that because of its alleged rapid elimination, it is devoid of
the after effects of barbital and other hypnotics.</p>

<p>The Council took up the substance in February, 1918, and referred the matter
to the referee in charge of barbital preparations. The referee considered
unwarranted the claim that Dial “Ciba” did not have the after-effects of
other hypnotics due to its alleged total decomposition in the body. The American
agents, A. Klipstein and Company, were informed of the referee’s objections.
Their attention was also called to the fact that, notwithstanding the
claimed absence of after-effects in one part of the advertising, other parts of
the same advertising admitted certain post-hypnotic effects of the product. It
was pointed out also that while it was claimed in one of the advertising circulars
that lowering of the blood pressure is never observed after administration of
Dial “Ciba,” yet two of the authors quoted in the same circular definitely stated
that a lowering of the blood pressure followed even small doses of the drug
and these authors warn against this very danger in certain conditions.</p>

<p>A year later, a circular letter sent out by A. Klipstein and Company
reiterated the claim that the asserted decomposition of Dial “Ciba” in the body
prevents after-effects, the drug being still contrasted with barbital (“veronal”).
In view of the reiteration of this highly improbable claim, the referee undertook
to study the comparative action of Dial “Ciba” as compared with other hypnotics.
It was found that the actions of Dial “Ciba” are not distinguishable, qualitatively,
<span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>from those of barbital, there being no perceptible difference in the
after-effects or in the nature of the side actions. In toxic doses, both caused
profound depression with the temperature falling to that of the room (or about
one degree above), the respiration being extraordinarily slow and shallow
as one would expect with lowering of the temperature. There were also the
same evidences of nausea that are so frequently seen after toxic doses of the
various hypnotics of this group. In view of these results, the Council
declared that it is unwarranted to claim freedom from after-effects for Dial
“Ciba.”</p>

<p>The Council held that the following statement is unwarranted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The therapeutic field for Dial ‘Ciba,’ as shown by tests on rabbits, is just as broad as the
field for Di­ethyl­barbituric Acid.”</p></div>

<p>Tests on rabbits do not and cannot show the breadth of the therapeutic
field for a hypnotic. The Council also declared the following statement improbable,
and contrary to the evidence obtained by the referee:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In dogs, the increase of dosage beyond the therapeutic dose to the point of death is
decidedly in favor of Dial ‘Ciba,’ which required a larger dose [than di­ethyl­barbituric acid]
to produce death.”</p></div>

<p>The referee’s experiments on cats show that Dial “Ciba” is several times as
toxic as hydrated chloral, and more than twice as toxic as di­ethyl­barbituric
acid (barbital).</p>

<p>Since the circular to which objection was made in 1918 was still being sent
out in December, 1919, the Council held Dial “Ciba” inadmissible to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.
and voted that report of its action in the matter be authorized for publication.
The Council further directed that Dial “Ciba” be included with Articles
Described but Not Accepted.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 24, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>APOTHESINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Apothesine is a synthetic drug for producing local anesthesia, made by
Parke, Davis &amp; Company. In the fall of 1917 the Council wrote to Parke,
Davis &amp; Company offering its aid in establishing the identity, purity and
therapeutic efficiency of this synthetic local anesthetic with the ultimate object
of accepting the product for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies should
the facts warrant such acceptance. The Council’s letter was never acknowledged.
After Apothesine was put on the market the Council desired to accept
it for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies but, unfortunately, was
unable to do so because some of the claims made for the product were not
justified by acceptable evidence. The manufacturers were notified of the
Council’s desire to admit this product to N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. and the wish was expressed
that the company would either so modify its claims as to make the product
acceptable under the Council’s rules or else would submit evidence to the
Council in proof of the claims made and thus permit the Council to revise its
conclusions. Parke, Davis &amp; Company were, apparently, either unwilling or
unable to submit evidence that would sustain their claims; neither did they
offer to modify the claims themselves. The product, therefore, is ineligible
to inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies; it will, however, be listed in
the “Described But Not Accepted” department of New and Non­official Remedies.
The report on Apothesine that follows has been authorized for publication.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span></p>
<p>Apothesine, “the hydrochlorid of diethyl-amino-propyl-cinnamate,” is an
efficient local anesthetic. It belongs to the procain rather than to the cocain
type, that is, it belongs to that type which, while effective for injection anesthesia
(especially when combined with epinephrin) is relatively inefficient when
applied to mucous membranes. Apothesine may also be used for spinal anesthesia.
Its absolute toxicity is less than that of cocain (as 20 is to 15, see table
below) but about twice that of procain (as 20 is to 40, see table below). It
is non-irritant, is easily soluble and makes a stable solution so that it may
readily be sterilized.</p>

<p>The Council took exception to certain claims made by Parke, Davis &amp;
Company for their product on the ground that these claims were not supported
by acceptable scientific evidence. One of the claims was that Apothesine is
applicable in any case in which any other local anesthetic is used. This statement,
made in many advertisements, is distinctly misleading as used. When
applied to mucous membranes Apothesine is far inferior to cocain and to some
other local anesthetics, yet the claim obviously suggests that Apothesine is an
efficient substitute for any local anesthetic.</p>

<p>The manufacturers claimed, too, that Apothesine is as potent as cocain.
The claim would lead the physician to think that Apothesine had the same
anesthetic potency as cocain in solution of equal strength. This statement, so
far as it refers to the drug when applied to mucous membranes, is not in accord
with the facts and is true for injection anesthesia only when stronger solutions
are used. The only support for the claim of equal efficiency appears to be the
experiments with intracutaneous injections made by H.&nbsp;C. <span class="nowrap">Hamilton<a name="FNanchor_130_136" id="FNanchor_130_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_136" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> in Parke,
Davis &amp; Company’s laboratory. These differed considerably from the results
of Sollmann<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_131_137" id="FNanchor_131_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_137" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> A further series of experiments were made by Sollmann to
compare still further the diverse results previously reported by him and
Hamilton. The latest series, while showing considerable variations in the susceptibility
of different skin areas, especially toward Apothesine, demonstrated
in every case that the efficiency of Apothesine is unmistakably lower than that
of cocain, being at best one half. The series also showed that the potency of
Apothesine was never greater than procain and averaged considerably below it.</p>

<p>Another claim made for Apothesine which the Council holds is not supported
by evidence is that of superior safety. This claim is made on the basis of hypodermic
injections in guinea-pigs carried out in the laboratory of Parke, Davis
&amp; Company. Such experiments prove little because of the fact&mdash;well known to
laboratory workers&mdash;that the use of rodents in toxicity tests made by injecting
a drug into the subcutaneous tissues does not give a reliable index of the
relative toxicity of such a drug for man. This is due partly to the peculiar
resistance of rodents to poisons and partly to the great importance of the
rate of absorption. The organism destroys most local anesthetics so rapidly
that the rate of absorption is more important than the absolute dose. The
absorption from hypodermic injections into guinea-pigs differs, of course, from
that in clinical accidents, especially where the drug has been applied to mucous
membranes. One cannot, therefore, reliably estimate the degree of clinical
danger on animals.</p>

<p>It has been shown that when toxicity tests of local anesthetics are made
on cats these animals seem to respond to the drugs in a manner more closely
approximating humans and it is a suggestive fact that the more toxic of local
anesthetics, as shown by tests on cats, have been found the most dangerous
in clinical use. The <i>absolute</i> toxicity of Apothesine has been measured by
<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>Eggleston and <span class="nowrap">Hatcher<a name="FNanchor_132_138" id="FNanchor_132_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_138" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> by the intravenous injection in cats. The fatal doses,
in terms of milligrams per kilogram ranged as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The <i>absolute</i> toxicity of Apothesine is, therefore, only a little lower than
that of cocain, and is twice as great as that of procain. The <i>clinical</i> dangers
cannot be predicted by either method, since clinical accidents depend, in most
instances, on idiosyncrasies, or the technic of application.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal

<h3>EUMICTINE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted and authorized publication of the report which
appears below. This report declares “Eumictine” ineligible for New and Non­official
Remedies because (1) it conflicts with Rule 10 in that it is unscientific,
(2) it conflicts with Rule 6 in that it is sold under unwarranted therapeutic
claims, (3) it conflicts with Rule 4 against indirect advertising to the public
in that the name “Eumictine” is blown in the bottle for the obvious purpose
of bringing the product to the attention of the public when it is prescribed in
the original package, and (4) because the name is thera­peutically suggestive
and not in any way descriptive of its composition.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Eumictine is a preparation from the laboratory of Maurice Le Prince, Paris,
France, and is marketed in this country by George J. Wallau, Inc., New York.
It is claimed that the product is “a balsamo-antiseptic preparation composed of
Santalol, Salol, and Hexamethylene-Tetramine, in the form of gluten-coated
capsules.” Nowhere in the advertising are the amounts of the ingredients
given. According to the American agent, however, “each capsule is supposed
to contain 20 centigrams of Santalol, 5 centigrams of Salol, 5 centigrams of
Hexamethylene-Tetramine.”</p>

<p>Eumictine is advised “in treating genito-urinary diseases (urethritis, cystitis,
prostatitis, pyelitis, etc.).” It is claimed to be “both an antiphlogistic modifying
agent, a well-tolerated diuretic” which “may be administered for long periods
without ill effects.”</p>

<p>The Council declares Eumictine ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies
because it is exploited in conflict with the following rules:</p>

<p>It is unscientific (Rule 10). Eumictine is composed of hexa­methylen­amin,
salol and sanalol in fixed proportions. Hexamethylenamin may serve a useful
purpose in some forms of infection of the urinary tract, but neither it nor salol
is of any considerable value in gonorrhea. It is now known that the balsamic
preparations, formerly so widely used, do not have the curative effects in
gonorrhea and associated conditions that used to be ascribed to them. To
combine three substances, none of which has any distinct therapeutic value in
the conditions for which Eumictine is proposed, does not enhance their value.
<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>There is nothing original in the combination used in Eumictine, or in the
manner of dispensing it.</p>

<p>It is sold under unwarranted therapeutic claims (Rule 6). These claims
are made not only for the components of Eumictine but for the combination
itself. Though santalol has certain advantages over the somewhat variable
oil of santal and other balsamic resins, it is not true that santalol “does not
cause congestion of the renal epithelium” or that it does not “produce exanthema
as do copaiba, cubebs, and the ordinary santal oil.” It is not true that salol is
“devoid of toxicity.” Neither is it correct to say that salol “asepticizes and
disinfects the bladder, the prostate and the urethra.” The claim that hexa­methylen­amin
“is of value when any acute symptoms or tendency to inflammation
subsist” is not justified. The claim that hexa­methylen­amin “renders
soluble the uric acid and urates” is also without foundation. The following
paragraph is characteristic of the claims made for Eumictine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Anti-gonorrhoic by its Santalol, diuretic, urolytic and analgetic by its hexa­methylene­tetramin
(Urotropin) antiseptic and antipyretic by its Salol, Eumictine represents a real therapeutic
advance in the scientific treatment of diseases of the urinary passages.”</p></div>

<p>Instead of being “a real therapeutic advance” in the treatment of diseases
of the urinary passages, Eumictine presents one of the complex combinations
that have long retarded the scientific treatment of these diseases. Eumictine
also conflicts with Rules 4 and 8 of the Council.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.

<h3>PLATT’S CHLORIDES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on “Platt’s
Chlorides.” It also declares the preparation inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because its composition is uncertain and indefinite and because
the claims made for it are exaggerated and misleading.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary</p>

<p>“Platt’s Chlorides,” marketed by Henry B. Platt, New York, is sold as a
disinfectant and germicide. Only incomplete and contradictory statements have
been made in regard to its composition. Many years ago (about 1899) the
composition of Platt’s Chlorides was given as “The Chlorids of Zn 40 per
cent., Pb 20, Ca 15, Al 15, Mg 5, K 5.” The statement that the preparation
contained 20 per cent. of lead chlorid is interesting, in view of the fact that
lead chlorid is soluble in water at ordinary temperatures to the extent of less
than 1 per cent. In a booklet, also issued a number of years ago, the following
“Formula of Platt’s Chlorides” was given:</p>

<p  class="ml1em fs85">“A saturated solution of Metallic Chlorids combined in the following proportions:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">“Sol. Zinc Chlorid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">40</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">“Sol. Lead Chlorid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">20</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">“Sol. Calcium Chlorid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">15</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">“Sol. Magnesium Chlorid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;5</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">“Sol. Potassium Chlorid</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;5</td><td class="tal">&nbsp;per cent.”</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The label on a bottle purchased in 1911, describes Platt’s Chlorides as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Highly Concentrated Solution of the Chlorids of Aluminum, Calcium, Lead, Zinc, etc.”</p></div>

<p>The label of a bottle purchased in 1919 reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Contains Inert Material: Water 84.0%. Sodium Chlorid 4.8%. Calcium Chlorid 0.3%.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span></p>
<p>This statement is obviously made to meet the requirements of the federal
Insecticide Act. This law requires either that the identity and the amounts
of potent ingredients in disinfecting preparations be declared or else that the
percentage of the inert ingredients of such preparations be given. The omission
from the label of all statements with regard to the potent ingredients of the
preparation and the absence of such a statement in recent advertising matter
suggests either that the older statements about its composition were false or
else that the composition has been changed.</p>

<p>Tscheppe published (Pharmaceutische Rundschau <b>8</b>:109, 1890) an analysis
of Platt’s Chlorides which has been quoted in other publications as indicating
the composition of the preparation. He reported that he found each quart
of the preparation to contain aluminum sulphate 6 ounces, zinc chlorid 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span>
ounces, sodium chlorid 2 ounces, calcium chlorid 3 ounces.</p>

<p>Some years ago (about 1911) the company made the following statement
relative to the germicidal power (phenol co-efficient) of Platt’s Chlorides:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. for some time the carbolic acid co-efficiency of our output has been from 2.5 to
4.3, the average being about 3; namely about three times stronger than pure carbolic acid.”</p></div>

<p>In 1912, the U.&nbsp;S. Public Health and Marine Hospital Service reported
(<i>Bulletin</i> 82, Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, p.&nbsp;69) that the phenol
coefficient of a sample of Platt’s Chlorides was so low that it could not be
determined and also that the sample was found to contain some mercuric chlorid.
In 1913, the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station reported (<i>Bulletin</i>,
July, 1913, p.&nbsp;292), that Platt’s Chlorides contained principally zinc chlorid, also
some aluminum chlorid, calcium chlorid, and traces of mercuric chlorid. The
phenol coefficient, determined by the Hygienic Laboratory method, was found
to be 0.05.</p>

<p>The preceding suggests that the composition of Platt’s Chlorides had been
changed (without notice to the consumer) and that it had been fortified by
the addition of mercuric chlorid. Years ago part of the advertising of this
product was a testimonial from a health official which declared that, for disinfection,
“bichlorid of mercury is useless in disinfecting sputum or discharges
from the bowels, being rendered inert by the albumin present” and it lauded
Platt’s Chlorides as devoid of such drawbacks.</p>


<h5>RECENT ANALYSES OF PLATT’S CHLORIDES</h5>

<p>To determine the present composition of Platt’s Chlorides and to compare
it with that sold formerly, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory has made an
analysis of a specimen purchased in 1919 and also of one purchased in 1911
and since kept unopened in the files of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.

<p>In the past, the advertising has suggested, more or less directly, that, as
chlorinated lime (bleaching powder) may be made to give off chlorin gas
which disinfects, so the air in a room may be disinfected by evaporating Platt’s
Chlorides. Thus the label of the 1911 specimen contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">For Store Rooms</span>, Refrigerators, and Closets, keep a sponge saturated with the pure
liquid in a saucer on an upper shelf.”</p></div>

<p>On the label of the 1919 specimen, the statement reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Refrigerators and Storerooms</span>&mdash;As a disinfectant wash regularly with one part Chlorides
to eight of water. As a deodorant, keep in an open vessel a sponge or cloth saturated with the
Chlorides full strength.”</p></div>

<p>That the owner of Platt’s Chlorides really believes that the vapors of the
preparation have disinfecting properties is seen from a letter over the name
of Henry B. Platt printed in the New York <i>Tribune</i> in 1916. This read, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. by keeping in a dish or saucer on radiators Platt’s Chlorides diluted one-half, the
hot solution will evaporate and purify the air, thus destroying the grip germ which is the
cause of all the trouble.”</p></div>

<p>From the analysis of Platt’s Chlorides, it is evident that when the preparation
is evaporated, water vapor only escapes<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_133_139" id="FNanchor_133_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_139" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> Whatever disinfecting or germicidal
action the preparation may possess is exercised only when the solution
is brought in direct contact with the substance to be disinfected.</p>

<p>The aluminum and zinc salts present may be useful as deodorants but they
are not effective as germicides. The presence of mercuric chlorid in a concentration
of 1 to 10,000 is hardly to be considered as materially increasing
the efficiency. The directions recommend the use of a mixture of 1 part of
Platt’s Chlorides to 10 parts of water for rinsing the hands, and a mixture of
1 part to 4 parts of water for the disinfection of discharges. It is further
stated that 1 quart makes 2 gallons sufficiently strong for general use. It is
evident that such dilutions decrease considerably the feeble germicidal action
of the original fluid.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 27, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>ANTI-TUBERCULOUS LYMPH COMPOUND (SWEENY) AND
ANTI-SYPHILITIC COMPOUND (SWEENY)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the reports which appear below,
declaring Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny) and Anti-Syphilitic
Compound (Sweeny) ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h4>Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny)</h4>

<p>“Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny)” is put out by the National
Laboratories of Pittsburgh, Dr. Gilliford B. Sweeny, “Medical Director.”
Sweeny has claimed at different times that he became interested in the subject
of von Behring’s efforts to immunize cattle to tuberculosis at a time when he
was an assistant in von Behring’s laboratory. He claims to have conceived the
idea while there of transferring bovine immunity to tuberculosis to the human
subject and later to have evolved his “treatment” at the Pasteur Institute in
Paris.</p>

<p>Just how Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound is made today is not stated&mdash;at
least so far as one is able to learn from recent advertising. Some years ago
Sweeny declared that his “Anti-Tubercular Lymph” (as it was then called) was
derived from a bullock which had been immunized to tuberculosis. Then:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The immunized animal having been slaughtered, the contents of the lymph reservoirs are
carefully collected and an aqueous extract is made from the grey cerebral substance, spinal
cord and the lymph glands. It is then filtered under high pressure and de-albuminized by
succussion. To this, the lymph, together with a definite proportion (50 per cent.), of the
naturally phosphorized brain fats is added, with a small amount of chloride of gold (about
1-60&nbsp;gr. to the dose), the latter as a preservative.”</p></div>

<p>It is a fair assumption that however the preparation may have been made
originally, it is not now made in such a manner as to bring it under the federal
laws governing the preparation of serums and similar preparations. The claims
made for Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound are of the usual uncritical and
unscientific type. Mainly, of course, they are of the testimonial class. The
physician is told that the preparation has been carefully tested by men whose
judgment is worthy of consideration; that the verdict has been altogether
favorable to the “Compound.” Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the remedy was submitted to a selected body of skilled physicians, recognized for
their skill and care in making therapeutic observations. These men represented widely varying
conditions, climatic and otherwise. Those who said ten years ago that Anti-Tuberculous
Lymph Compound has a specific immunizing influence upon the tuberculosis patient, find the
same to be true today.”</p></div>

<p>Careful reading of the matter just quoted will reveal its ambiguity and
inherent lack of frankness. The inference conveyed is that the “selected body
of skilled physicians” have unqualifiedly endorsed Anti-Tuberculous Lymph
Compound (Sweeny)&mdash;but it does not say so!</p>

<p>It is the history of all such preparations, introduced to the medical profession
with the usual blare of trumpets, that a certain number of favorable
testimonials can be obtained. It is also the history of such products that one
has but to wait a few years and the physicians who had written most enthusiastically
regarding the preparation&mdash;in the first flush of their optimism following
its use and the perusal of the manufacturers’ literature&mdash;will acknowledge
that they were mistaken in their original estimate and are no longer using
the agent. In this connection an investigation of some of the old testimonials
for Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound by the Propaganda department of
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> is instructive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="267"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span></p>
<p>In a somewhat elaborate booklet published in 1907 by Sweeny, an Indiana
physician was said to have reported favorable results following the administration
of the “lymph.” A letter written to this physician in October, 1919, asking
for his present opinion on the product brought this reply, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it being twelve years since using the serum and no reference or repeated orders
since should surely suffice as evidence of my lack of faith in the serum<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>An Illinois physician was reported in the same booklet to have described
a case of a young man with an active tuberculosis, who was given injections
of the “lymph” in February, 1907. The patient, it was claimed, showed immediate
improvement and the Sweeny booklet (published in August, 1907) stated
that “improvement in this case continued and terminated in complete recovery.”
A letter written to the physician in October, 1919, brought out the fact that
the young man in question, after receiving “Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound”
and <i>other treatment</i> was removed “on a stretcher” “to New Mexico,
where he remained for three or four years” and recovered. The doctor adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not think that the Anti-Tuberculous Lymph had anything to do with the man’s
recovery, although I realize the difficulty of definitely analyzing just what did effect the cure.
I did since that time use that preparation in several other cases without beneficial results so
that I gave it up a good many years ago adding it to that large heap of pharmaceutical material
‘weighed and found wanting.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>A physician in Texas also reported in the 1907 booklet as having had very
satisfactory results with the Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound in one case
of pulmonary tuberculosis was written to in October, 1919. He replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will state that subsequent use of this compound did not bear out the apparent good
results from its use in the first case or two.”</p></div>

<p>In a “Bulletin” issued by the Sweeny concern in 1912, a Pennsylvania
physician was quoted as having treated three cases with Anti-Tuberculin Lymph
Compound with resultant cures. This physician was written to in October,
1919, and he replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have no knowledge of the use of my name by any Pittsburgh concern and know nothing
of a lymph of the name of Sweeny; neither do I recollect ever curing three cases of tuberculosis
with any lymph.”</p></div>

<p>The same “Bulletin” quoted the alleged statement by a Delaware physician
to the effect that he believed Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound to be the
most successful treatment of tuberculosis extant. This in 1912. To an inquiry
sent in October, 1919, this physician briefly replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Am not using it now.”</p></div>

<p>The result of the Propaganda department’s questionnaire was what might
have been expected. Every physician who answered the inquiry regarding his
previous and present opinions of Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny)
declared, in effect, that he had long since ceased to have faith in its value or
efficacy.</p>

<p>According to claims made in Sweeny literature, “Anti-Tuberculous Lymph
Compound exercises its immunizing power through a specific action upon the
blood cells.” The statement that “it destroys the tuberculosis germ when this
is present in the system of the patient” is untrue. The facts are, no serum or
lymph has thus far been proved to have any value in the treatment of tuberculosis
even when fortified by “a small proportion of chloride of gold and soda”
as one circular tells us the “lymph” is. In spite of research by competent investigators,
we are still without any aid in the form of a serum in the treatment
of tuberculosis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="268"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span></p>
<p>Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny) is one of those preparations
that need no elaborate laboratory tests, nor even exact therapeutic research,
to convince any clear-thinking person that it is patently and obviously worthless.
One would hesitate before asking any reputable clinician to test a preparation
of this sort. It is a constant source of surprise that some physicians allow
themselves to be persuaded by advertising literature that is obviously uncritical
and unscientific, to use preparations which have no more reasonable foundation
than this one.</p>

<p>The Council declares Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny) not
acceptable for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>


<h4>Anti-Syphilitic Compound (Sweeny)</h4>

<p>This preparation also is made by or under the direction of the same Dr.
Gilliford B. Sweeny whose researches (?) led to the production and evolution
of the Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound (Sweeny). According to the data
at hand, this preparation is made by suspending benzoate of mercury in lymph
from the bullock. Case reports are given of alleged cures of syphilis after two
months of treatment; indeed, the circular exploiting the agent makes the statement
that it is seldom necessary to continue the treatment beyond two months,
which, if one chose to be credulous, would indicate extraordinary power for the
mercury.</p>

<p>Mercury of course has a proper place in the treatment of syphilis, but that
any physician could be induced to place his trust in this preparation is almost
unthinkable though testimonials&mdash;which the “National Laboratories” claim to
have received from physicians&mdash;are published. They all stamp the writers as not
only gullible but also incompetent. The tenor of the claims is on a par with
those made for the Anti-Tuberculous Lymph Compound; they do not justify
the time required for detailed consideration.</p>

<h3>SYRUP LEPTINOL (FORMERLY SYRUP BALSAMEA)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report on “Syrup
Leptinol” (formerly “Syrup Balsamea”). The product is inadmissible to “New
and Non­official Remedies,” first, because the manufacturers fail to give the
profession information regarding either the amount of the potent ingredient
or the method of determining its identity and uniformity; second, because of
the unwarranted recommendation for its use in such infectious diseases as
pneumonia and epidemic influenza and for lack of satisfactory supporting evidence
of its alleged therapeutic efficacy in other diseases and, third, because the
recommendations for its use appearing on and in the trade package constitute
an indirect advertisement to the public.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Syrup Leptinol is sold by the Balsamea Co. of San Francisco. It was first
introduced as Syrup Balsamea. In recent advertising, Syrup Leptinol is also
referred to simply as “Leptinol.”</p>

<p>According to the statements of the Balsamea Co., Syrup Leptinol is prepared
from the root of a species of Leptotaenia (a plant belonging to the parsnip
family) which grows in Nevada and which has heretofore not been used in
medicine. The manufacturer states that the botanists who have been consulted
have been unable to agree on the botanical classification of the plant. The
dried root of this unclassified species of Leptotaenia is extracted with alcohol
<span class="pagenum" title="269"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>and from the extract so obtained the syrup is made, but no information has been
furnished to show how the alcohol-soluble material is incorporated in the syrup.
Further, the manufacturer has not announced tests whereby the identity and
uniformity of the finished preparation may be determined.</p>

<p>A booklet contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The species of Leptotaenia from which <span class="smcap">Leptinol</span> is produced was first used in medicine
by Dr. E.&nbsp;T. Krebs, who, after thorough laboratory investigation and clinical application over
a period of several months, which resulted in the perfecting of <span class="smcap">Leptinol</span>, prescribed the
preparation for Influenza during the epidemic of that disease in 1918 with remarkably good
results. Since this first use, <span class="smcap">Leptinol</span> has been exhaustively tested by clinicians in private
practice and in hospitals in the treatment of Pneumonia, Influenza Bronchitis, etc., and has
been universally endorsed.”</p></div>

<p>In a circular letter it is asserted that the use of “Leptinol” during the
“influenza epidemic” of 1918–1919 “demonstrated its almost specific action in
respiratory affections”; that “during this epidemic it proved to be five times
as efficacious as any other treatment in pneumonia&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”; and that “it is now
as firmly fixed in the mind of many doctors for respiratory diseases as quinine
is for malaria and the salicylates for rheumatism.”</p>

<p>In the booklet it is further stated that the therapeutic action of the preparation
is primarily that of a “stimulating expectorant” and secondarily as a
“sedative expectorant”; that “its antiseptic action in the respiratory tract is
prompt”; that it “is an effectual cardiac tonic where the tone of the heart muscle
is impaired by fever”; that “in acute pulmonary conditions it effectively
improves the respiratory action and allays cerebral irritation due to fever and
toxins”; that it acts “as a vital stimulant and nerve sedative”; that “it stimulates
the excretion of acid by the skin and in fever it has a strongly diaphoretic and
antipyretic action without depressing the circulation or the central nervous
system”; that it is “mildly diuretic” and “slightly augments the biliary flow” and
that “it increases the gastric and intestinal secretions and allays intestinal
fermentation.”</p>

<p>No evidence has been presented to the Council which shows that Syrup
Leptinol has the actions ascribed to it. The reports of clinical trial are little
more than chance observations and lack all control. This applies also to the
following, stated to be a quotation from the report of the Tonopah Mines
Hospital Association:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the spring of 1919 a recurrence of the Influenza epidemic of the previous winter was
experienced. During the first period of this second epidemic, prior to April 15th, there were
treated one hundred sixteen cases of Influenza, fourteen of which developed Influenzal Pneumonia,
with six deaths. The Pneumonia was of the very virulent type which prevails in this
high altitude<span class="ell">...</span>. After April 15th, when the clinical use of Leptinol was inaugurated,
three hundred and sixty-eight cases of Influenza were treated and not a single case developed
Pneumonia. Twenty-two cases of Influenzal Pneumonia were received and treated with
<span class="smcap">Leptinol</span>, with a consequent one hundred per cent. recovery<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“In the cases where <span class="smcap">Leptinol</span> was used the treatment was the same as had been previously
followed, as to diet, fresh air, etc., but the medication was confined to <span class="smcap">Leptinol</span>. Syrup
<span class="smcap">Leptinol</span> was started immediately in one-dram doses at one-hour intervals, in cases with high
temperatures, and this was continued until temperature and pulse subsided. It was then used
in one-dram doses at three-hour intervals as recovery progressed. On admission to the hospital,
calomel in <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain doses, was given at fifteen minute intervals for eight doses. The last
calomel was followed in six hours by <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> ounce Magnesium Sulphate in saturated solution.
The second day <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain of calomel was given at one-hour intervals for ten doses<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Medical journals are replete with reports of remarkable results obtained
with the most varied forms of treatment instituted at the time that the “influenza
epidemic” had been reached. In these cases it is more than probable that the
lessened virulence of the causative factor of the disease, the gradually established
resistance of those stricken with it in the latter period and the improved
management resulting from experience deserve the credit for the successful
outcome of the treatment, rather than the particular form of medication
employed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="270"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span></p>
<p>The report of the Tonopah Mines Hospital Association directly implies
that Syrup Leptinol prevents the development of pneumonia in practically all
cases of influenza in which it would develop and that it entirely abolishes the
mortality of that disease. However, it is well known that innumerable remedies
have been recommended as specifics in the treatment of pneumonia on the basis
of the treatment of a limited number of cases which recovered, and that
eventually these asserted specifics have been discarded as of little value. In
the present instance, the recovery of twenty-two cases in succession afford
<i>prima facie</i> evidence that those cases were not the virulent type of pneumonia
in which the death rate is very high under any methods of treatment. While no
effort appears to have been made to determine the nature of the infecting
organism, the records show fairly conclusively that they belonged to those
causing the milder type of pneumonia.</p>

<p>The Council finds Syrup Leptinol (formerly Syrup Balsamea) inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies because: (1) the information in regard to
composition does not state the amount of potent ingredient, nor permit the
determination of its identity and uniformity; (2) the recommendation for its
use in such infectious diseases as pneumonia and epidemic influenza is unwarranted
and its claimed therapeutic efficacy in other diseases is without satisfactory
supporting evidence; and (3) the recommendations for its use which
appear on the label and the circular wrapped with the trade package constitute
an indirect advertisement to the public.</p>

<p>The Council accepts the explanation of the manufacturer that he has been
unable to obtain a satisfactory classification of the plant from which Syrup
Leptinol is made. It would be undesirable to exclude from therapeutic use a
valuable drug simply because its botanical character has not been determined
or because an exhaustive chemical examination had so far not been made.
However, in the absence of such information the manufacturer should give
full information with regard to the preparation or standard­ization of his remedy
and the therapeutic claims made for it should be accompanied by indisputable,
thoroughly controlled clinical evidence. In the case of Syrup Leptinol, there
is no satisfactory evidence available showing that the preparation has any
value in the treatment of epidemic influenza, pneumonia, whooping cough, etc.
While it is probable that a balsamic syrup, such as Syrup Leptinol, has palliative
properties in coughs, such action does not at all justify the claim that it is useful
in the contagious diseases for which it is proposed. The Council cannot
recognize a syrup presenting an unknown plant in uncertain proportions which
is recommended in a variety of dangerous contagious diseases in which it
ultimately may be harmful, even though in early stages of these diseases it may
serve to allay some of the milder symptoms.</p>

<p>Concerning the composition of the plant from which Syrup Leptinol is
prepared, the Balsamea Company states that it contains “Alkaloids, acids,
glucosides, volatile and fixed oils, gums and resins.” This information is
valueless, since no information is given concerning the character, amounts or
pharmacologic action of the ingredients. Further, it is unreliable as far as the
presence of alkaloids is concerned since the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
has been unable to find any alkaloids in the specimen of the crude drug furnished
by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>In accordance with its regular procedure, the Council submitted the preceding
statement to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>In reply the Balsamea Company stated that it is more than ever of the
belief that Syrup Leptinol is deserving of recognition by the Council, basing
this opinion on further clinical experience with it in the treatment of influenza.</p>

<p>The manufacturer stated that the use of the words “Leptinol” and “Syrup
Leptinol” interchangeably was due to an oversight and promised to limit the
use of the word “Leptinol” to an alcoholic extract of the plant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="271"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span></p>
<p>Concerning the method of preparation of this alcoholic extract and the
amount used in the preparation of Syrup Leptinol the Balsamea Company replied
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The alcoholic extract of the Leptotaenia, which we have termed ‘Leptinol’ is a preparation
of definite and uniform strength, as determined by two methods: (a) the gravity test using
the U.&nbsp;S. Hydrometer Scale for spirits, by which Leptinol registers 52 degrees at 60 degrees F.,
and (b) by gentle evaporation of the alcohol content and the measuring of the active constituents,
which measures twenty-five per cent. by weight.</p>

<p>“The alcoholic extract ‘Leptinol’ is glycerinated in a machine, using one part of the alcoholic
concentration to four parts of glycerin. This is then added to eleven parts of a heavy syrup,
containing 7<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> pounds of sugar to the gallon of syrup, and thoroughly mixed in an agitating
machine. Leptinol is the sole active ingredient of Syrup Leptinol. Syrup Leptinol is a
preparation of uniform strength. It is far more uniform in strength than most of the syrups
of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. made from fluid extracts which are made from crude drugs which are not
uniform in strength.”</p></div>

<p>This claim cannot be allowed as meeting the conflict with Rule 1. It is
well known that plants vary in their composition at different times of the
year; under different conditions of cultivation and growth; and under other
conditions; hence the claim that alcoholic extracts of equal specific gravity insure
uniformity of composition in active principles must be considered entirely
illogical, especially since the exact nature of the active principles, if any be
present, is unknown. If these are known their nature should be stated and
tests for their identity be given. If they are unknown it is manifestly misleading
to state that the preparation is of uniform strength.</p>

<p>It is evident that the Council cannot approve of the use of a preparation of
unknown composition without satisfactory evidence of its value, especially
when it is recommended in a variety of serious infectious diseases such as
influenza and pneumonia. The mere fact that a small number of patients who
have received the drug recover is no evidence of its curative value, and until
carefully controlled clinical tests of the preparation are made, it is not entitled
to the consideration of physicians.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 5, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>FORMITOL TABLETS, II</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following supplementary
report on Formitol Tablets.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>In the Council report (<span class="smcap">The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</span>, Oct. 4, 1919, p.&nbsp;1077) on the
ineffectiveness of lozenges claimed either to contain formaldehyd or to liberate
formaldehyd in the mouth, the composition of Formitol Tablets of the E.&nbsp;L.
Patch Co. was briefly discussed in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reported that Formitol Tablets contained
formaldehyd (or para­formaldehyd), an ammonium compound, and
some hexa­methylen­amin. It is probable that the formaldehyd (or para­formaldehyd)
was produced by the decomposition of hexa­methylen­amin
originally present in the tablets but decomposed by long contact with the
acid.”</p></div>

<p>At the time this report was published, the label and the advertising matter
contained but vague and indefinite statements with regard to the composition
of Formitol Tablets. In the October, 1919, issue of <i>Patchwork</i>, the house organ
of the E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co., it was denied that these tablets contain hexa­methylen­amin
since none had ever been used in their manufacture. It was also claimed
that the company had a “printed sheet giving the formula of these tablets.”</p>

<p>The Council advised the E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co. that it desires to publish only facts
about the products which it examines and that if the report on Formitol Tablets
<span class="pagenum" title="272"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>was inaccurate in any way the Council would want to correct any error it might
have unintentionally made. As the Formitol advertising in the files of the
Council contained no information as to the composition of the tablets, the
firm was also requested to send the printed sheet giving the “formula.”</p>

<p>When this printed “formula” came it was found to be a sheet used by the
E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co. for the purpose of giving its salesmen information regarding
Formitol tablets, to be passed on to the physician. This printed sheet conveyed
the information that Formitol Tablets contain ammonium chlorid, benzoic acid,
citric acid, guaiac, hyoscyamus, menthol, paraformaldehyd and tannic acid,
but it gave no information in regard to the amount of any of the ingredients
except that it declared that each tablet represents the equivalent of 10 minims
of a 1 per cent. formaldehyd solution.</p>

<p>Because of the nonquantitative, and, therefore meaningless printed “formula”
and because, also, of its complexity, it was thought desirable to make a more
complete analysis of Formitol Tablets. Experience has shown that frequently
the real formula of a thing is quite different from the alleged formula published
by the manufacturer. The details of the laboratory’s later analysis
will appear in the Annual Reports of the Chemical Laboratory or may be
had on request.</p>

<p>The result of the laboratory’s additional experimental work, especially when
taken in connection with investigations made elsewhere on the interaction of
formaldehyd and ammonium chlorid justifies the conclusion that Formitol
Tablets do contain some hexa­methylen­amin, even though the amount may be
very small. As the E.&nbsp;L. Patch Co. declare that no hexa­methylen­amin is put
into Formitol Tablets the conclusion drawn in the Council’s original report to
the effect that the formaldehyd probably was formed by the decomposition
of hexa­methylen­amin was evidently an error. The hexa­methylen­amin present
is doubtless produced by the action of the paraformaldehyd on the ammonium
chlorid present.</p>

<p>The analysis also showed that more than 78 per cent. of the weight of
Formitol Tablets was made up of sugars and about 16.5 per cent. was starch
and other material, some of which was talcum or similar material. This means
that about 94 per cent. of the total weight of the tablets is sugar and starch,
neither of which is mentioned in the printed “formula.” The significance of
this is apparent when it is considered that there are eight ingredients listed
in the “formula” for which therapeutic effects are claimed. Since a tablet
weighs about 13.5 grains, the combined weight of all the claimed active
ingredients is less than 1 grain per tablet!</p>

<p>The amount of ammonium chlorid found, as indicated by the total nitrogen,
was not more than 1.0 per cent. or about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> grain per tablet. The amount of
benzoic acid found was 0.34 per cent. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25</sub></span> grain per tablet. Yet these two
drugs are said to exert their peculiar expectorant action. (The U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.
lozenge of ammonium chlorid contains 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains ammonium chlorid or twelve
times the amount of this drug in a Formitol Tablet.)</p>

<p>The tannic acid contained in the tablets could not be determined with
accuracy but it was much less than 1 per cent. (or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> grain per tablet) yet
it is said to add valuable astringent qualities to Formitol Tablets! (The
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. lozenge of tannic acid contains 1 grain of tannic acid.)</p>

<p>The quantity of guaiac (as resin) is but a fraction of 1 per cent. Yet it is
said to impart to Formitol Tablets “stimulant resolvent” properties and it is
intimated that there is sufficient to be of value in “cases of abscess of the
throat and inflammation of the tissues.”</p>

<p>The total acidity indicates the presence of about 2 per cent. of citric acid
or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain per tablet. Yet this amount is said to be “antiseptic” and “aids in
the general results.”</p>

<p>While the presence of the drug hyoscyamus (henbane) was not positively
identified by microscopic examination, alkaloids were present.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span></p>
<p>The manufacturers claim that the tablets contain menthol yet only a suggestion
of menthol could be obtained from the odor. However, the odor of
methyl salicylate&mdash;a constituent <i>not</i> declared in the “formula”&mdash;predominated
throughout the operations of analysis.</p>

<p>Formitol Tablets furnish a good illustration of some well established but
often ignored truths:</p>

<p>1. “Formulas” that are nonquantitative are valueless or worse than valueless.</p>

<p>2. The fact that a manufacturer puts certain drugs in a mixture, is no
proof that these drugs are there when the mixture reaches the patient. The
physician must be assured that they are there when he prescribes them.</p>

<p>3. Complex mixtures should be avoided. It is absurd to expect, as is
claimed in the case of Formitol Tablets, anodyne, antiseptic, astringent, expectorant,
and resolvent action all at the same time.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>SUKRO-SERUM AND APHLEGMATOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Two years ago, American newspapers contained accounts of an alleged
cure for pulmonary tuberculosis “discovered” by Prof. Domenico Lo Monaco
of Rome, Italy. At that time no reference to the “cure” could be found in
medical journals which had come from Italy and other European countries
(<i>The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i>, July 13, 1918, p.&nbsp;142). Later, reports were published
of experiments carried out in Italy, according to which the intramuscular
injection of solutions of sugar (saccharose&mdash;cane sugar) diminished pulmonary
secretion and was of considerable value in the treatment of tuberculosis (<i>The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i>, Sept. 28, 1918, p.&nbsp;1083). On the whole the reports of the
trial of what has been called the Italian Sugar Cure for Consumption have
been unfavorable. At a meeting in Paris in October, 1918, Drs. Louis Rénon
and Mignot reported that they had found that the disease in guinea-pigs was
not modified by the treatment and with humans the results were also negative
(Paris Letter, <i>The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i>, Nov. 23, 1918, p.&nbsp;1760).</p>

<p>In view of the exploitation of this treatment in the United States by the
Anglo-French Drug Co., which offers “Sukro-Serum,” and by G. Giambalvo &amp;
Co., which sells “Aphlegmatol,” and because of inquiries received, the Council
has authorized publication of the statement which follows.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>A circular issued by the Anglo-French Drug Co., describes “Sukro-Serum”
as a “Sterilized Solution of lacto-gluco-saccharose.” By reading the circular
to the end, however, one learns that “Sukro-Serum” is not a “serum” in
the ordinary sense but apparently it is a solution of ordinary sugar (sucrose).
“Sukro-Serum is a sterilized, specially prepared solution of Saccharose.”</p>

<p>Sukro-Serum has been advertised (<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Med. Jour.</i>, Sept. 6, 1919) as an
“INTRA­MUSCULAR INJECTION FOR TUBERCULOSIS” “<span class="ell">..</span>. ready
for use in cases of Pulmonary and general Tuberculosis” with the assertion
that “It is quite certain that in the near future Sukro-Serum will be largely
used and its value fully recognized.” The circular received from the Anglo-French
Drug Co. contains quotations from an article by Professor Lo Monaco
in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> (Aug. 24, 1918) setting forth the merits of
intramuscular injections of sucrose in tuberculosis. It is recommended that
“Néocaine-Surrénine” (which the Anglo-French Drug Co. supplies) be used
for the control of pain when Sukro-Serum is injected.</p>

<p>The circular enclosed with a package of “Aphlegmatol,” purchased from
G. Giambalvo &amp; Co., contained the following with reference to the composition
of this preparation:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="274"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A solution of Hydrats of Carbon After the formula of Prof. D. Lo Monaco, Director of
the Institut of Physiological Chemistry of the University of Rome. Contents: <i>Sucrose
(C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) Glucose and Galactose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)</i>.”</p></div>

<p>The package contained ampules of thin, fragile, brown colored glass, containing
approximately 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;c.c. of light, clear, amber colored, thick, sticky fluid,
having a distinct caramel odor. Reaction <i>p</i><sub>H</sub> = 5.0. A reducing substance
(probably glucose) amounting to 7.4 per cent. was found by using Benedict’s
method for estimating glucose quantitatively; after hydrolysis with hydrochloric
acid, 55.5 per cent. glucose was found. There was no reaction for albumin.
No attempt was made to identify the sugars, as it seemed probable that in the
preparation caramel had been produced.</p>

<p>The circular which accompanied the package of Aphlegmatol contained the
following information (spelling and composition as in original) about its use
and effects:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be emploied where a large bronchial secretion is present in the respiratory branches
disease. The secretion will diminish and, in non complicated cases, it will completely disappear.</p>

<p>Fever, cough, hemottisis, night perspiration, vomiting and difficulty of breathing are, in the
meantime, diminuished.</p>

<p>Aphlegmatol acts also as a riconstituent, being itself a nurrishing composition, improves
the digestive function of the body and increases the arterial pressure.</p>

<p>5&nbsp;c.c. (2 Phials) of Aphlegmatol per day must be injected intramuscularly in the Gluteus.</p>

<p>If the patient wishes two injections may be made, one at the right immediately followed
by a second one at the left.</p>

<p>The cure must not be interrupted untill sometime after expectoration has disappeared,
which result may be obtained only after fifty or sixty days, in the meantime the patient must
be controlled by his home physician, especialy when thermal elevation of the body takes place.</p>

<p>Improvement will be manifested on or about the tenth day of the first injection.</p></div>

<p>In the advertising circular, which is apparently intended for general distribution,
much the same information is given as in the sheet enclosed with the
ampules, except that in the directions we find: “If the injections are painful&mdash;especially
in cases where patients are very emaciated&mdash;physicians are advised
to inject together with <i>Aphlegmatol</i>, as an anesthetic, a vial with 1&nbsp;c.c. solution
of Stovain at 3%.” The advertising for Aphlegmatol contains many misspelled
words and appears to be the work of those ignorant of the English language.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is a widespread disease and a majority of the uninformed are
only too willing and ready to try such a “cure.” The preparations appear to be
nothing more than concentrated solutions of sugar. It is probable that a small
amount of the cane sugar might be inverted to glucose and fructose, but
experiments have shown that cane sugar subcutaneously administered in the
small amounts used in this instance is largely excreted in the urine unchanged.
Less is known about galactose, but the evidence available would indicate that

<h3>SUPSALVS NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report declaring
Supsalvs (Anglo-French Drug Company) inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Supsalvs are advertised by the Anglo-French Drug Company as “stable
suppositories of ‘606’ (of French manufacture)” with the claim that by the
rectal administration of these suppositories the effects of arsphen­amine may
be obtained. The asserted efficacy of Supsalvs medication is based in part
<span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>on the claim that for these suppositories an excipient was found which mixes
with the cocoa butter base “to form an assimilable emulsion.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The active principle and the vehicle being bound to one another, the mucous membrane is
able to absorb both simultaneously and progressively in the form of an organic emulsion.”</p></div>

<p>As no information was furnished the Council by the Anglo-French Drug
Company on the origin or quality of the arsphen­amine used in the preparation
of Supsalvs or the character of the vehicle which was “bound” to the arsphen­amine
in such a way as to permit the absorption of this combination in the form
of an “organic emulsion,” the firm was requested to furnish: (1) Evidence
that the arsphen­amine used in Supsalvs complies with the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. standards
and that deterioration of it does not occur in the preparation of the suppositories
or on keeping. (2) The identity of the ingredients composing the suppository.</p>

<p>The Anglo-French Drug Company did not supply the requested evidence
and consequently the Council judged the preparation on the basis of the information
received from the company, and that contained in the available advertising
and circulars. It found Supsalvs inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies, first because the quality of the medicament contained in the suppositories
has not been established, and second because the claimed efficacy
of this preparation as a means of securing the effects of arsphen­amine lacks
substantiating proof.</p>

<p>During the past few years some French physicians have reported favorably
on the intrarectal administration of arsphen­amine. Boyd and Joseph at Panama
published (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 17, 1918, p.&nbsp;521) an enthusiastic report on
intrarectal injection of arsphen­amine but did not refer to its use in the form
of suppositories. In a comprehensive report, on the “Treatment of Syphilis”
(<i>Quarterly Journal of Medicine, July, 1917</i>) L.&nbsp;W. Harrison stated that arsphen­amine
(Salvarsan) in the shape of an enema is definitely less effective than
intravenously and that “Neisser and the vast majority of workers can see no
value in the rectal method.” Schamberg and Hirschler (A Safe and Efficient
Intensive Method of Treating Syphilis, <i>Therapeutic Gazette</i>, November, 1919,
p.&nbsp;761) have given a rather thorough trial of this method; the results were most
disappointing: “A certain or rather uncertain amount of arsphen­amine is
absorbed into the blood, but the quantity is obviously too small to be at all
comparable in its effect with the intravenous administration. Our conclusions
are that the rectal administration of arsphen­amine or neo­arsphen­amine is an
extremely feeble method of administering these drugs.”</p>

<p>The report of the Special Committee on the Manufacture, Biological History
and Clinical Administration of Salvarsan and Other Substances of the
British National Health Insurance Medical Research Committee contains the
following: “The rectal method of administration, either in the form of solution
or as suppositories, has been advocated by a few observers mainly for cases
in which there is difficulty in the adoption of the intravenous method. The
experiments made by Mills at Rochester Row show that three enemata of
‘606’ (0.6&nbsp;Gm. in each) on successive days failed to produce any effect on the
spironemes in the lesions. The general opinion of experienced workers is that
the rectal method is ineffective, and in this view the Committee concur.”&mdash;(<i>From
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 30, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>PARATHESIN NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The local anesthetic ethyl paramino­benzoate was first introduced as “Anesthesin”
or “Anæsthesin.” Ethyl paramino­benzoate is not patented in the United
States and it may be manufactured, therefore, by any firm which chooses to
do so. In order that a common name by which to designate the drug might be
available, the Council coined the name “Benzocaine,” as being short and easily
remembered, but yet suggestive of its composition and character (“benzo” to
indicate its derivation from benzoic acid and “caine” to indicate its cocaine-like
properties). As the term “anesthesin” had become a common name for
the drug, the Council recognized this as a synonym for benzocaine.</p>

<p>One of the accepted brands for benzocaine is “Anesthesin,” manufactured
by the H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories, Inc. (see New and Non­official Remedies, 1920,
p.&nbsp;33). However, on April 19, 1920, the Metz Laboratories requested that its
product be recognized under the designation of “Parathesin.” As the use of one
substance under several names causes confusion and retards rational therapeutics,
the Council’s rules provide against the recognition of proprietary
names for nonproprietary, established drugs. In view of this and because
the legitimate interests of the manufacturer may be safeguarded by appending
his name or initials to the common name, benzocaine or anesthesin, the Council
voted not to recognize the designation “Parathesin.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 13, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>CHLORLYPTUS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The condensed report on Chlorlyptus which follows and also a complete
detailed report was sent to the proprietor, Jan. 9, 1920. In reply he requested
that publication be postponed pending the submission of further clinical evidence.
As after nine months this evidence had not been received the Council has
authorized publication of its report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Chlorlyptus is manufactured by Chas. A. Weeks, trading as the Weeks
Chemical Company, Philadelphia. It is prepared by chlorinating eucalyptus oil
until it has bound 30 per cent. of chlorin, the chlorin being in relatively stable
combination. It is claimed that Chlorlyptus is a new “chlorinated antiseptic,”
highly efficient as a wound antiseptic and at the same time nonirritant and
nontoxic. Chlorlyptus is offered for use in the treatment of local infections
of all types, as well as of burns, and also as an antiseptic in the alimentary
and genito-urinary tracts.</p>

<p>The claims were based largely on reports of investigations made by Philip
B. Hawk and his collaborators. These reports the referee of the committee in
charge of Chlorlyptus considered incomplete and unconvincing. Being advised
of this Mr. Weeks caused further investigations to be made. Some of the
information was checked and extended by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
and by the referee.</p>

<p>The laboratory side of the investigation may now be considered as complete.
The results show that Chlorlyptus is a feeble antiseptic of the aromatic oil
type, considerably weaker than eucalyptus oil, both as to therapeutic and toxic
qualities. The chlorin contained in it is bound too firmly to have any action;
in fact, the chlorination appears to have accomplished nothing more than a
considerable destruction or weakening of the eucalyptus oil. As far as the
referee can judge, this object could have been accomplished just as effectively
by diluting ordinary eucalyptus oil with some indifferent solvent.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of Chlorlyptus contends that if the experimental findings
are against his product, it should be judged by the clinical data. The clinical
evidence, however, is not decisive. It shows that wounds healed and infections
were prevented or successfully combated in cases in which Chlorlyptus was
used in combination with good surgery, but it does not show how much of
the result was due to the surgery and how much, if any, to the use of
Chlorlyptus. Even if it were granted as probable that the Chlorlyptus contributed
to the favorable outcome, it would still be a question whether it equals
other established antiseptics, or whether it possesses any material advantages
over diluted eucalyptus oil. Until these points are established the clinical
reports cannot offset the unfavorable results of the laboratory investigation.</p>

<p>The manufacturer has endeavored to obtain more convincing clinical reports,
but the lack of success in this direction during the past nine months gives little
encouragement that acceptable clinical evidence will be available within a reasonable
time.</p>

<p>Believing that the information which has been obtained should be made
available to the profession, the Council authorized publication of this statement
and also of the detailed report. The Council voted not to accept Chlorlyptus
for New and Non­official Remedies because of the unfavorable results of the
laboratory investigation, but with the agreement that the product would receive
further consideration should more convincing clinical data become available.</p>

<h3>I. DETAILED REPORTS</h3>

<h4>Summarized Reports</h4>


<h5>CHEMICAL NATURE OF CHLORLYPTUS</h5>

<p>Chlorlyptus is prepared by chlorinating eucalyptus oil until it has bound 30
per cent. of chlorin. “Chlorlyptol” is prepared in an analogous manner from
eucalyptol. There has been some confusion as to the composition; but the
principal constituent is now stated to be “a dichloride of eucalyptus oil,” to which
the formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub> has been assigned. It differs from the “chlorinated
eucalyptus oil,” as ordinarily used for making dichloramin-T solutions, and
which contains only <span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> per cent. of chlorin.</p>


<h5>AVAILABILITY OF CHLORIN IN CHLORLYPTUS</h5>

<p>The chlorin content of chlorlyptus is almost entirely firmly bound, and
therefore not “available,” in contrast to the group of so-called chlorinated
antiseptics (i.&nbsp;e., the hypochlorite and chloramin type). For instance, it does
not directly liberate iodin from iodid. It contains a very small quantity of
free hydrochloric acid, or perhaps some acid esters, and liberates a little more
on prolonged contact with water; but the total quantity liberated under reasonable
conditions is very small. According to Hawk’s data, they correspond only
to <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> per cent. HCl even after standing with water overnight and to only <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub></span>
per cent. of HCl after two weeks. The referee has shown that this quantity of
acid has no therapeutic significance.</p>

<p>The “bound” chlorin of chlorlyptus, being chemically inactive, would have
no more practical significance than the bound chlorin in common salt. The
“ozone” said to be used during the preparation, to expel the HCl, has also
practically disappeared, to judge by the slowness with which iodin is liberated
from potassium iodid.</p>


<h5>ACID FORMATION</h5>

<p>Some constituents of chlorlyptus hydrolyze slowly and to a slight degree
with the liberation of a trace of free hydrochloric acid. According to the data
of Hawk’s report, the free acidity, in term of HCl, is <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub></span> per cent. On
standing with water over night, this increases to <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> per cent.</p>

<p>On this basis, Hawk proposed a theory that the claimed antiseptic effects
of chlorlyptus are due to the continuous liberation of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Experiments by the referee show this to be untenable. The traces of acid
are neutralized and absorbed by the tissues so rapidly that an acid reaction is
not maintained. These experiments are described in the appendix.</p>

<p>They were submitted to the manufacturers, who in the name of Mr. Weeks
(May 9, 1919) concede this conclusion and state that “there is no doubt that
the referee’s statements as to action in mouth, contact with living tissue and
improbability that the acidity is effectively antiseptic is correct, and I am
willing to accept the referee’s statement as conclusive in this respect.”</p>


<h5>BACTERIAL CULTURE EXPERIMENTS</h5>

<p>Mr. Weeks submitted a statement by Hawk to the effect that chlorlyptus
has a phenol coefficient of 2.6, determined by the standard Hygienic Laboratory
procedure.</p>

<p>He also quotes Rockefeller War Hospital that chlorlyptus kills <i>Staphylo­coccus
aureus</i> in concentra of 1 dram: 1 gallon (about 1:1,000), but not in more dilute
solutions.</p>

<p>More recently, he presented a more comprehensive report by Rivas, which
is reproduced in the appendix. The essential results are tabulated herewith.
<span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>This tabulation shows that chlorlyptus fails to kill the organisms after an hour’s
exposure of the following concentrations:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
Typhoid in bouillon, 10 per cent. of chlorlyptus.<br />
Staphylococci in pus, 5 per cent. of chlorlyptus.<br />
Staphylococci in serum, 1 per cent. of chlorlyptus.<br />
</p>

<p>It seems to the referee that a substance that is ineffective with an hour’s
exposure to these concentrations is not at all likely to kill or check bacteria
under clinical conditions. In other words, it is not an antiseptic in the ordinary
sense.</p>

<p>The referee is not impressed by the superior power attributed by Rivas to
chlorlyptus in the presence of pus. Inefficiency of 10 per cent. for one-half
hour or of 5 per cent. for two hours seems a failure rather than a success.
The referee also notes the absence of any data as to the relative efficiency
of chlorlyptus against staphylococci in pus and in bouillon. The data on serum
indicate that chlorlyptus is much weaker than phenol and show that it is <i>less
effective in the presence of pus</i> than in other mediums.</p>

<p>The referee fails to grasp the bearing of the oil experiments on any clinical
condition. Moreover, the inconstant results mentioned by Rivas suggest the
possibility that the incorporation of the bacteria in oil may have prevented their
effective distribution in the culture medium. If any significance is to be attached
to these experiments, they should be checked by controls, without antiseptics.</p>

<h5>INFECTION EXPERIMENTS IN VIVO</h5>

<p>Dr. Rivas reports two series of experiments, in each of which three guinea-pigs
received staphylo­coccus suspensions in the peritoneum. One guinea-pig
in each series was left untreated; the others received injections of chlorlyptus
into the peritoneum at various intervals.</p>

<p>The following results were obtained:</p>

<p>This shows mortalities of:<br />
1 in 2, i.&nbsp;e., 50 per cent., without chlorlyptus.<br />
3 in 4, i.&nbsp;e., 75 per cent., with chlorlyptus.<br />
</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether so small a series of experiments on so variable a
phenomenon as is infection should receive any serious consideration. So far
as they go, they would indicate that chlorlyptus is useless or worse.</p>


<h5>TOXICITY</h5>

<p>The referee determined the acute toxicity of chlorlyptus by hypodermic
injection of oily solutions into white rats. Comparative experiments were made
with ordinary eucalyptus oil. The details are given in the appendix. The
end-results may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p><i>Fatality.</i>&mdash;The doses are calculated for cubic centimeters of the undiluted
drugs per kilogram of rat.</p>

<p>Dr. Rivas reports a series of toxicity experiments on guinea-pigs. Assuming
a uniform weight of 400&nbsp;gm. per animal, his results (details in appendix)
may be summarized as:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The <i>comparative toxicity</i> in the various series is therefore approximately
as follows:</p>

<p>Evidently, the toxicity of chlorlyptus is about one-fourth of that of eucalyptus
oil. The difference is considerable, but not fundamental. Moreover,
the symptoms of chlorlyptus resemble the characteristics of eucalyptus oil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="281"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span></p>
<p>According to the tabulation of Barker and Rowntree<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_136_142" id="FNanchor_136_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_142" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> the mean fatal dose
of eucalyptus oil for man, in the twenty-nine clinical cases reported in the
literature, is about 20&nbsp;c.c. If the toxicity ratio of the two substances were the
same as for the rat experiments (a rather hazardous assumption), the fatal
dose of chlorlyptus for man would be about 80&nbsp;c.c.</p>


<h5>IRRITATION</h5>

<p>Rivas’s Experiment 14 shows that chlorlyptus gives very definite irritation,
apparently similar to that produced in Experiment 16 by eucalyptus oil in
one-fourth the dose.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the referee may add from personal experience that the
“chlorlyptus oil, 5 per cent. Cl” is markedly irritating in the nostrils, although
marked “non-irritating” on the label.</p>

<h3>II. APPENDIX: SPECIAL REPORTS</h3>


<h3>A. COMPARISON OF CHLORLYPTUS WITH
CHLORINATED EUCALYPTOL</h3>

<h4>From the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association</h4>


<p>According to the label, “Chlorlyptus” is a “Synthatized Chlorinated Oil of
Eucalyptos, with Acid Reaction, containing approximately 30 per cent. Chlorine
and possesses excellent Germicidal Properties, when made under our special
process.” It is manufactured by the Weeks Chemical Company, Philadelphia,
Pa. This product was submitted to the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
by the manufacturers, and in turn the Laboratory was asked to examine it
with the idea of comparing it with the nonproprietary brands of “chlorinated
eucalyptol” (used as a solvent for dichloramine-T; see New and Non­official
Remedies, 1919, p.&nbsp;70). In the submission, certain tests were described, most
of which were followed. Among the statements given under the chemical
properties of chlorlyptus are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On distillation, chlorlyptus begins to boil at about 100&nbsp;C. The temperature rises as the
distillation continues, accompanied by the decomposition of the chlorlyptus and the evolution
of hydrochloric acid and chlorine.”</p>

<p>“When brought into contact with water, chlorlyptus undergoes a process of hydrolysis&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing the statement is made on the label that
chlorlyptus “is a Stable Compound, not affected by heat, light or water.”</p>

<p>The following comparisons of chlorlyptus, chlorinated eucalyptol-Abbott and
chlorinated eucalyptol-Squibb were made:</p>

<p>Chlorlyptus is a viscous, dark brown liquid, with an acrid odor and having
a specific gravity of 1.2098. Chlorinated eucalyptol-Abbott is a mobile, light
yellow liquid, with a eucalyptus odor, having a specific gravity of 0.9317.
Chlorinated eucalyptol-Squibb is a mobile, colorless liquid, and its specific
gravity is 0.9303.</p>

<p>An alcoholic solution of silver nitrate added to an alcoholic solution of
chlorlyptus yields a heavy precipitate of silver chloride. In the case of
the Abbott chlorinated eucalyptol a slight turbidity is caused by this test;
the Squibb product shows no reaction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="282"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span></p>
<p>A 10 per cent. solution of potassium iodide is overlaid with an equal
volume of chlorlyptus. Iodine is slowly liberated, being noticeable in one-half
hour. With chlorinated eucalyptol-Abbott, a trace of free iodine is discernible
after four hours, while with chlorinated eucalyptol-Squibb there is no free
iodine present. When the respective products are shaken with an alcoholic
solution of potassium iodide, no iodine is immediately liberated, thus showing
the absence of “active chlorine” (difference from the hypochlorite derivatives).</p>

<p>When chlorlyptus is dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid, some blackening
occurs and the odor of hydrogen chloride is very noticeable. Both the
Abbott and Squibb brands of chlorinated eucalyptol give a reddish mixture,
with no perceptible evolution of hydrogen chloride, and still retain the characteristic
eucalyptol odor.</p>

<p>On heating, chlorlyptus decomposes and begins to boil at from 103 to
105&nbsp;C. Then a higher fraction comes over at 178&nbsp;C. The distillate has a
sharp odor, is acid, and frees very little iodine from potassium iodide. Chlorinated
eucalyptol-Abbott does not seem to decompose. Some gaseous substance
is given off at 80&nbsp;C, but the liquid distills at 173&nbsp;C. The distillate has no acid
odor, is neutral, and liberates no iodine from potassium iodide. (In both cases
the distillation was not carried to completion, approximately only about half
of the volume being distilled over.)</p>

<p>The addition of chlorlyptus to a mixture of 10 per cent. potassium iodide,
10 per cent. potassium iodate solution, brings about the liberation of iodine,
increasing perceptibly on standing. This shows that the hydrogen chloride is
gradually split off, and in time will cause a solution having a considerable
degree of acidity. When this test is carried out on chlorinated eucalyptol-Abbott,
a small amount of iodine is liberated in a few minutes but does not
increase, showing a slight initial acidity without further hydrolysis. Chlorinated
eucalyptol-Squibb yields no free iodine after standing three hours.</p>

<p>When the chlorine content of chlorlyptus is determined according to the
method of Carius, the amount is found to be 29.6 per cent. (The manufacturers
give a method of determining chlorine by Hunter’s fusion method.
<span class="pagenum" title="283"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></span>It is believed that in this method hydrogen chloride may be lost, and this
opinion is substantiated by the firm’s statement, “Chlorlyptus analyzed in this
manner shows approximately 25 per cent. of chlorine.”) The chlorine content
of chlorinated eucalyptol-Abbott is found to be 0.67 per cent., and that of
the Squibb brand to be 0.62 per cent. (about one-fiftieth as much as in
chlorlyptus).</p>

<p>To sum up: Chlorlyptus differs from chlorinated eucalyptol in odor, color,
density, in reaction to silver nitrate, potassium iodide, sulphuric acid and the
aqueous solution of potassium iodate and potassium iodide. The distillation of
the two products occurs differently. Chlorlyptus contains nearly 30 per cent.
of chlorine, which is approximately fifty times as much as in chlorinated
eucalyptol. Thus it appears to have considerable chlorine in the negative form
(Cl<sup>-</sup>) which may be relatively easily split off as hydrogen chloride.</p>

<h3>B. THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ACID</h3>

<h4>Reaction of Chlorlyptus in the Body</h4>


<h5>BY THE REFEREE</h5>

<p>This “chlorinated ozonized eucalyptus oil” is distinctly acid to litmus paper.
It is claimed that further quantities of acid are liberated on contact with
water. This is credited with producing a continuous acid reaction on the
surface of tissues to which the oil may be applied and this in turn is stated
to be antiseptic or germicidal.</p>

<p>This theoretical speculation does not take into account the large quantity
of reserve alkali in the body by which it combats attempts to alter its normal
reaction. It is therefore not convincing, unless it is supported by direct
evidence.</p>

<p>In the absence of such data on the part of the promoters of the preparation,
experiments were made to determine whether the oil preserves its acid reaction
in contact with mucous and serous membranes. The answers were clearly in
the negative.</p>

<p>In the mouth, the reaction becomes neutral within ten or fifteen minutes;
in the pleura and peritoneum within half an hour, and probably in much
shorter periods.</p>

<p>More detailed data follow:</p>


<h6>SERIES A: BEHAVIOR IN THE MOUTH; HOMO</h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment.</span>&mdash;Chlorlyptus and to less extent Chlorlyptus Oil, are acid
to litmus. They are applied:</p>

<p class="ml1em">(<i>a</i>) Drop to litmus paper and this to gums.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Several drops directly to tongue.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Same to gums.<br />
The reaction to litmus paper is tried from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Results.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Applied to gums on litmus paper:</p>

<p class="ml1em">Chlorlyptus: Red color becomes gradually feebler and does not spread on
the paper.<br />
Chlorlyptus Oil: Turns blue in a few minutes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Dropped on <i>tongue</i>:</p>

<p class="ml1em">Chlorlyptus: Acid taste at once. Does not increase, but on contrary, becomes
less.<span class="pagenum" title="284"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span><br />
Litmus applied after ten minutes: not acid.<br />
Litmus applied after five minutes: distinctly acid.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Dropped on inside of <i>cheek</i>:</p>

<p class="ml1em">Chlorlyptus, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;c.c.: After six minutes, litmus very red.<br />
After ten minutes, faintly red.<br />
After fifteen minutes, blue.<br />
Chlorlyptus Oil, 1&nbsp;c.c.<br />
After three minutes, faintly red.<br />
After eight minutes, neutral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusions.</span>&mdash;On contact with living tissues, the acid of chlorlyptus is
rapidly neutralized and absorbed.</p>

<p>The surface is neutral within ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>It is therefore very improbable that the acidity is effectively antiseptic.</p>

<p>A comparison of chlorlyptus with dilute acetic acid shows that the chlorlyptus
does not maintain the acidity even as well as 1 per cent. acetic acid.</p>

<hr class="r16" />
<h3>D. REPORT OF DR. D. RIVAS</h3>


<p>The following are the results of experiments conducted by me, during the
past four months, on the germicidal action of chlorlyptus (chlorinated oil of
eucalyptus, principal constituent C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>17</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub>) in vitro and in vivo, and comparison
also with carbolic acid, oil of eucalyptus and dichloramine in test for irritation
and toxicity.</p>

<p><i>Germicidal Action.</i>&mdash;Based on the results obtained, chlorlyptus when used
in a 5 per cent. paraffin oil solution was found to be a mild germicidal against
typhoid B, strepto­coccus and staphylo­coccus when these organisms were suspended
in ordinary bouillon culture or sterile salt solutions.</p>

<p>The germicidal action was found stronger when these micro-organisms were
suspended in a sterile oily or lipoid substance, such as olive oil. The results
of these experiments were not constant, owing probably to the imperfect suspension
of the bacteria. Thus, while in some of the experiments chlorlyptus
in 1 per cent. oil solution destroyed these micro-organisms, in other cases
the same strength solution failed to give same result in same time.</p>

<p>The increased germicidal action of chlorlyptus on bacterial suspensions in
olive oil may be accounted for by the fact that chlorlyptus is soluble in olive
oil and not an admixture, as in the case of paraffin oil.</p>

<p>Chlorlyptus is not a coagulant, as are germicides of the phenol or hypochlorite
types, and the germicidal action is therefore not strictly comparable.</p>

<p>The germicidal action of chlorlyptus oil solution, on pathogenic bacteria,
on strepto­coccus and staphylo­coccus, suspended in pus, was found to be
stronger than when these micro-organisms were suspended in ordinary bouillon
culture or sterile salt solution. In one of the experiments, similar results were
obtained when these micro-organisms were suspended in olive oil, chlorlyptus
showing marked germicidal action.</p>

<p><i>Irritation and Toxicity.</i>&mdash;The irritating action was found to be relatively
mild in tests on laboratory animals. Thus, from 0.5 to 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus in
paraffin oil 5 per cent. solution, injected into peritoneal or pleural cavities of
guinea-pigs weighing 400&nbsp;gm. was found to be without any appreciable disturbance
in the health of the animal, and in some cases the injection of as much
as 2&nbsp;c.c. did not kill the animal.</p>

<p><i>Therapeutic Action.</i>&mdash;Guinea-pigs were inoculated with purulent material
containing strepto­coccus, staphylo­coccus and <i>B. coli</i> in peritoneal and pleural
cavities respectively, and after six hours 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus 5 per cent. in
paraffin oil solution was injected. Other infected animals were similarly
treated twenty-four hours after inoculation, and another series forty-eight
hours after inoculation. In some of these cases the animals died from shock
but in a clearly defined series in which the injection of 1&nbsp;c.c. of the chlorlyptus
solution was made in the peritoneum of the guinea-pigs twenty-four hours
after the inoculation, the animals lived. The control animal, inoculated with
the purulent material and not treated with chlorlyptus oil solution, died.</p>

<p>In consideration that the injection of chlorlyptus oil solution [sic, referee]
were made [? referee] in the peritoneal cavity this substance is apt to affect
the vital organs in the abdominal cavity. It is my belief that in case of wall
abscess of chronic inflammation, by limiting the action of chlorlyptus to the
<span class="pagenum" title="287"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a></span>infected area, preventing at the same time the infection of the vital organs,
chlorlyptus, because of its non-irritating quality, can be used effectively as an
antiseptic.</p>


<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>1. Chlorlyptus is a mild and relatively nonirritating antiseptic of marked
action on pus and suppuration.</p>

<p>2. When bacteria were suspended in olive oil or in pus, chlorlyptus showed
marked germicidal action.</p>

<p>3. Chlorlyptus can be injected into the peritoneum or the pleural cavities
of guinea-pigs in the proportion of 1&nbsp;c.c. per 400&nbsp;gm. of body weight without
detriment to the animal.</p>

<p>4. Chlorlyptus in 5 per cent. oil solution (taking Clause 3 as comparison)
can perhaps be injected in man as an antiseptic agent when there is a walled-in
abscess in the peritoneum or pleural cavity where there is drainage, in the
proportion of 0.5 to 1&nbsp;c.c. per pound of body weight with good result.</p>


<h5>REPORT ON THE GERMICIDAL ACTION OF CHLORLYPTUS ON PATHOGENIC
BACTERIA IN VITRO AND IN VIVO</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 1.</span>&mdash;<i>The germicidal action of eucalyptus oil.</i>&mdash;Typhoid bacillus was destroyed
in less than five minutes when exposed to the action of a 5 per cent. suspension of oil of
eucalyptus. The exposure for four hours in a 5 per cent. suspension of chlorlyptus in paraffin
oil was without effect on typhoid bacillus. It requires an exposure of two to four hours in a
10 per cent. suspension of chlorlyptus in paraffin oil to destroy typhoid bacillus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Bacilliary action of chlorlyptus on the growth of pathogenic bacteria.</i>&mdash;Typhoid
and anthrax bacilli were selected for the experiment. Two series of five tubes each
were made. The culture medium used was nutrient bouillon. Chlorlyptus was added in the
following proportions: Tube 1, 1:10; Tube 2, 1:100; Tube 3, 1:1,000; Tube 4, 1:10,000, and
Tube 5, 1:100,000. One series was inoculated with typhoid bacillus. All tubes were incubated
for three days at 37&nbsp;C.<br />
&emsp;Chlorlyptus inhibited the growth of typhoid bacillus when added to the bouillon in the proportions
of 1:10. The growth of anthrax bacillus was inhibited by chlorlyptus when it was
added in the proportions of 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1,000, as shown in the accompanying table.
[The table was not submitted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] In one instance the growth was markedly inhibited by
chlorlyptus when added in the proportion of 1:10,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on typhoid bacillus.</i>&mdash;Bouillon cultures of
typhoid bacillus forty-eight hours old, and a suspension of forty-eight-hour agar cultures of
typhoid bacillus in sterile salt solution were used for the experiment. Chlorlyptus was added
in the proportion of 1:1,000; 1:1,500; 1:100; 2 per cent.; 3 per cent.; 4 per cent.; 5 per
cent. and 10 per cent., respectively.<br />
&emsp;Inoculations were made in trypsinized peptone bouillon after the addition of chlorlyptus
at different intervals, namely: at once, after five minutes, after ten minutes, after fifteen
minutes, after thirty minutes, after one hour and after two hours, and tubes incubated at
37&nbsp;C. for forty-eight hours.<br />
&emsp;Result: Growth was shown in all tubes except those in which chlorlyptus was added in the
proportion of 10 per cent. and after the action of the antiseptic for two hours or longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Inhibitory action of chlorlyptus in the growth of typhoid bacillus.</i>&mdash;Chlorlyptus
was added to sterile bouillon in the proportion of 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000 and
1:100,000, and incubated for forty-eight hours at 37&nbsp;C. to eliminate any possible contamination
of the bouillon during the manipulations. All tubes were found sterile and inoculated with
typhoid bacillus.<br />
&emsp;Result: All tubes were found sterile again after being inoculated with typhoid bacillus and
incubated at 37&nbsp;C. for forty-eight hours, which shows chlorlyptus inhibited and the growth of
typhoid bacillus in bouillon when this antiseptic was added in the proportions of 1:100 to
1:100,000.<br />
&emsp;Remarks: In another experiment made, chlorlyptus showed a weaker inhibitory action on
the growth of typhoid bacillus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 5.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of carbolic acid.</i>&mdash;The technic was the same as that outlined
in Experiment 1. except that carbolic acid was used instead of chlorlyptus.<br />
&emsp;Result: Carbolic acid showed a distinct germicidal action on typhoid bacillus in the proportions
of 1 per cent. in ten minutes.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="288"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 6.</span>&mdash;<i>Action of nitrogen gas on the growth of typhoid bacillus in bouillon and
nutrient agar when chlorlyptus was added to this culture medium.</i>&mdash;Chlorlyptus was added to
the bouillon in the proportions of 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000 and 1:100,000, as outlined in
Experiment 2; also to agar kept melted at 45&nbsp;C. Tubes were inoculated with typhoid bacillus;
plates were made of the inoculated agar tubes; all plates and tubes were incubated at 37&nbsp;C.
for forty-eight hours in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas.<br />
&emsp;Duplicate experiments were made with cultures of typhoid bacillus as above in bouillon and
agar plates containing the same amount of chlorlyptus and incubated at 37&nbsp;C. in ordinary
atmosphere as control.<br />
&emsp;Result: Nitrogen gas did not show any appreciable increase of the germicidal action of
typhoid bacillus when grown in medium containing chlorlyptus. Growth was about the same
in cultures supplied with nitrogen gas as in those growing in ordinary atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 7.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on pyogenic bacteria suspended in an oily
medium.</i>&mdash;Experiment with strepto­coccus: Cultures of strepto­coccus in blood agar three days
old were suspended in olive oil (sterile), and chlorlyptus was added in the proportions of
1, 5 and 10 per cent. and inoculated in trypsinized bouillon at different intervals, namely: at
once, after five minutes, after ten minutes, after fifteen minutes, after thirty minutes, and after
one hour. Tubes were incubated at 37&nbsp;C. for forty-eight hours.<br />
&emsp;Result: All tubes remained sterile. The germicidal action of chlorlyptus on strepto­coccus
suspended in oil was almost at once and with certainty after five minutes when added in the
proportion of 1, 5 and 10 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 8.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on staphylo­coccus, suspended in sterile
olive oil.</i>&mdash;The technic employed was the same as in Experiment 5, except that a culture of
staphylo­coccus was used.<br />
&emsp;Result: All tubes remained sterile. The germicidal action of chlorlyptus was almost at
once in the proportions of 1, 5 and 10 per cent.<br />
&emsp;Remarks: By repeating this experiment the result showed some variations. The discrepancy
was probably due to an imperfect suspension of the micro-organism in the oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 9.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of carbolic acid on strepto­coccus suspended in olive oil.</i>&mdash;The
technic employed was the same as in Experiment 5, except that carbolic acid was used
instead of chlorlyptus.<br />
&emsp;Result: The germicidal action of carbolic acid of strepto­coccus suspended in olive oil was
almost at once in the proportions of 1, 5 and 10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 10.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on staphylo­coccus.</i>&mdash;The technic employed
was the same as in Experiment 6 except that the carbolic acid was used instead of chlorlyptus.<br />
&emsp;Result: The germicidal action of carbolic acid on staphylo­coccus suspended in olive oil
was almost at once, in proportions of 1, 5 and 10 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 11.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on pyogenic bacteria suspended in pus.</i>&mdash;Chlorlyptus
was added to sterile pus in the proportions of 1, 5 and 10 per cent., and then
inoculated with staphylo­coccus and cultures were made in bouillon at once, after five minutes,
after ten minutes, after fifteen minutes, after thirty minutes, after one hour and after two
hours, respectively, and tubes incubated for forty-eight hours at 37&nbsp;C.<br />
&emsp;Result: Growth was shown in all tubes except those inoculated from tubes in which
chlorlyptus was added in the proportions of 10 per cent. after one hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 12.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of chlorlyptus on strepto­coccus suspended in sterile
human blood serum.</i>&mdash;Staphylo­coccus culture in agar forty-eight hours old was suspended in
sterile human blood serum, and to the suspension chlorlyptus 5 per cent. in paraffin oil was
added in the proportions of 1, 5 and 10 per cent. Inoculations were made at intervals, at
once, after five minutes, after ten minutes, after fifteen minutes and after one hour in trypsinized
bouillon. Tubes were incubated at 37&nbsp;C. for forty-eight hours.<br />
&emsp;Result: Chlorlyptus showed inhibitory action on the growth of staphylo­coccus in the
strength of 10 per cent., but did not produce complete sterilization. Similar results were
shown with the 5 per cent., and in the 1 per cent. chlorlyptus did not show any inhibitory
action at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 13.</span>&mdash;<i>Germicidal action of carbolic acid on staphylo­coccus suspended in human
blood serum (sterile).</i>&mdash;The technic employed was the same as in Experiment 10 except that
carbolic acid was used instead of chlorlyptus.<br />
&emsp;Result: Carbolic acid produced a complete sterilization in the strength of 10 per cent.
almost at once, and with certainty after five minutes. Similar results were produced with the
5 per cent. The 1 per cent. carbolic acid did not show any appreciable germicidal action on
staphylo­coccus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment 14.</span>&mdash;<i>Toxic and irritant action of chlorlyptus.</i>&mdash;Six normal guinea-pigs were
used for the experiment. Guinea-Pig 1 was injected peritoneally with 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus,
Guinea-Pig 2 with 2&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus, Guinea-Pig 3 with 3&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus, Guinea-Pig 4
with 4&nbsp;c.c. and Guinea-Pig 5 with 5&nbsp;c.c. 5 per cent. respectively. Guinea-Pig 6 was used as a
control and not injected.<br />
<span class="pagenum" title="289"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
&emsp;Result: Guinea-Pigs 1 and 2 did not show any appreciable disturbance. Guinea-Pig 3 was
sick for four days, after which it gradually recovered but it became sick again after one week
and died ten days after the injection. Guinea-Pig 4 died over night. Guinea-Pig 5 died six
hours after injection. Guinea-Pig 5 was injected at 11:30 with 5&nbsp;c.c. chlorlyptus. Ten minutes
after the injection it was lying relaxed, respiration and heart normal, conjunctive reflex
present. One hour after the injection the animal seemed to present symptoms resembling those
of narcosis: respiration and heart were normal. After four hours there was no change in the
condition of the guinea-pig except that the respiration was irregular. Five and a half hours
after it showed prostration with irregular respiration and heart action. Six hours after
injection the animal was dead.<br />
&emsp;Autopsy: The peritoneum showed a congestion and a fibrinous exudation, amount of liquid
increased, some part of which was probably chlorlyptus unabsorbed. Spleen about normal,
liver congested, kidney about normal, suprarenal glands about normal, lungs normal, pleural
cavity obtained no exudation, heart soft, flabby and congested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 15.&mdash;<i>Toxic and irritant action of chlorlyptus when injected into the pleural
cavity.</i>&mdash;Six normal guinea-pigs used for the experiment. Chlorlyptus was injected in the
pleural cavity as follows: Guinea-Pig 1, 0.5&nbsp;c.c.; Guinea-Pig 2, 1&nbsp;c.c.; Guinea-Pig 3, 2&nbsp;c.c.;
Guinea-Pig 4, 3&nbsp;c.c., and Guinea-Pig 5, 4&nbsp;c.c. Guinea-Pig 6 was used as a control.<br />
&emsp;Result: Guinea-Pigs 1 and 2 recovered about four hours after injection. Guinea-Pig 3
died three days after and Guinea-Pigs 4 and 5 four and two hours after, respectively.<br />
&emsp;Conclusions: Guinea-pigs weighing on the average of 400&nbsp;gm. may be injected peritoneally
with one or two c.c. or intrapleurally with 0.5 to 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus without having fatal
results from the injection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 16.&mdash;<i>Toxic and irritant action of eucalyptus oil.</i>&mdash;Three normal guinea-pigs
were used for the experiment. Guinea-Pig 1 was injected with 1&nbsp;c.c. of oil of eucalyptus in
the peritoneum, and Guinea-Pig 2 with 0.5&nbsp;c.c. in the pleural cavity. Guinea-Pig 3 was used
as a control.<br />
&emsp;Result: Guinea-Pig 1 died about three hours after injection, and Guinea-Pig 2 about two
hours after the injection.<br />
&emsp;Autopsy: Both guinea-pigs showed marked congestion and a moderate degree of exudate
in the peritoneum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 17.&mdash;<i>Toxic and virulent action of eucalyptus.</i>&mdash;Three normal guinea-pigs were
selected for the experiment, as in Experiment 16. The injection was made in the pleural
cavity. Guinea-Pig 1 was injected with 0.5&nbsp;c.c. and Guinea-Pig 2 with 1&nbsp;c.c. of eucalyptus oil.<br />
&emsp;Result: Guinea-Pig 1 died the following day, and Guinea-Pig 2 one hour after the injection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 18.&mdash;<i>Toxic and irritant action of dichloramin-T, 0.5 per cent. in chlorcozane.</i>&mdash;One
guinea-pig was used for each experiment. Guinea-Pig 1 was injected with 0.5&nbsp;c.c. and
Guinea-Pig 2 with 1&nbsp;c.c. of dichloramin-T peritoneally.<br />
&emsp;Result: Both animals became restless immediately after the injection, and died twelve hours
after of acute hemorrhagic peritonitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 19.&mdash;<i>Effect of chlorlyptus on staphylo­coccus suspended in salt solution and
one of that solution injected into the peritoneum of the guinea-pig.</i>&mdash;Three guinea-pigs were
used for the experiment. Guinea-Pig 1 was injected with 0.5&nbsp;c.c. of staphylo­coccus suspension
as control. Guinea-Pig 2 was given the same, and immediately after received 1&nbsp;c.c. of
chlorlyptus. Guinea-Pig 3 was injected with the same amount, and chlorlyptus was injected
twenty-four hours after injection.<br />
&emsp;Results: Guinea-Pig 1 was sick and weak with loss of appetite for some days, but gradually
recovered. Guinea-Pig 2 died over night.<br />
&emsp;Autopsy: There was a large amount of exudate in the peritoneal cavity, irritation of the
intestine, and other signs of acute inflammation. A moderate degree of congestion; spleen
not enlarged; liver showed cloudy swelling and fibrinous exudate; lungs and heart about
normal except for a moderate degree of congestion but no exudate. Guinea-Pig 3 was sick
for some days, but recovered gradually one week after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 20.&mdash;<i>Effect of chlorlyptus in vivo on staphylo­coccus.</i>&mdash;The experiment was
conducted in the same way as in Experiment 17, but 2&nbsp;c.c. were used instead of 1&nbsp;c.c.<br />
&emsp;Result: Guinea-Pig 1 was injected with 2&nbsp;c.c. staphylo­coccus suspension and died over
night. Autopsy showed that the animal died of acute peritonitis. The peritoneum showed
some fibrinous exudate and mesenteric vessels. Guinea-Pig 2 was injected with 2&nbsp;c.c. of
staphylo­coccus, and eighteen hours after was injected with 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus. The animal
died two weeks after injection. Guinea-Pig 3 was injected with 2&nbsp;c.c. staphylo­coccus suspension,
and twenty-four hours after with 1&nbsp;c.c. of chlorlyptus. The Guinea-Pig died ten days
after. Autopsy revealed bronchopneumonia of the left lung and acute miliary abscess in the
liver.</p></div>

<h3>AQUAZONE (OXYGEN WATER)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Aquazone is stated by the Aquazone Laboratories, Inc., Los Angeles,
California, to be a supersaturated solution of oxygen in water, carrying
approximately five and one-half times as much dissolved oxygen as ordinary
water. In an advertising booklet, it is suggested that Aquazone is of value
in the treatment of influenza, pneumonia, typhoid, Bright’s disease and kindred
disorders. It was also stated therein that in the treatment of fevers it lowers
the temperature, and that the administration of three bottles of Aquazone
(representing 0.033&nbsp;gm.&mdash;1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain&mdash;of oxygen) is of value for “preventive
and tonic purposes.”</p>

<p>The evidence which the Aquazone Laboratories submitted did not show
that the effects were other than those which might be obtained from the administration
of ordinary potable water. The Council declared Aquazone inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies, because the therapeutic claims made for
it were unwarranted, and because its use is irrational for the reason that oxygen
given by stomach in this way is of little or no value.&mdash;(<i>Abstracted from Reports

<h3>COAGULEN-CIBA OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report announcing
the deletion of Coagulen-Ciba from New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Coagulen-Ciba, a product of the Society of Chemical Industry, Basle,
Switzerland, was admitted to New and Non­official Remedies in 1915. It is
stated to be an extract prepared from blood platelets and to contain thromboplastic
substances (cytozym, thrombokinase, thrombozym) mixed with lactose.
Extensive clinical reports appeared to justify its acceptance for New and
Non­official Remedies with Fibrin Ferments and Thromboplastic substances.</p>

<p>In 1918, Dr. Arthur D. Hirschfelder reported to the Council that of a number
of specimens of Coagulen-Ciba examined by him, failed to accelerate the
coagulation time of blood.</p>

<p>In view of Dr. Hirschfelder’s findings, the Therapeutic Research Committee
of the Council invited Dr. P.&nbsp;J. Hanzlik to undertake an exhaustive investigation
of thromboplastic substances, the Council, in the meantime temporarily retaining
Coagulen in New and Non­official Remedies until the investigation was completed.</p>

<p>The following report on the eligibility of Coagulen-Ciba was made to the
Council by Dr. Hanzlik:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Object</i>: To test the claims of thromboplastic and hemostatic activities.</p>

<p><i>Claims</i>: Coagulen is alleged to be a “physiological styptic prepared from the natural
coagulants of animal food contained in the blood platelets. It has the characteristics of a
lipoid.” (If cephalin is meant it is difficult to understand why platelets should be selected
in preference to other abundantly supplied organs such as brains).</p>

<p>“Coagulen is indicated in all cases of external and internal hemorrhage due to a deficiency
of the coagulating power of the blood: epistaxis, hemophilia, hemorrhage from gastric or
duodenal ulcer, melaena neonatorum, hemorrhage from the gums, the lungs, the bladder, the
uterus, hemorrhage during or after operations (turbinectomy, tonsillectomy). It has also
been used as a prophylactic before operations, likely to produce severe hemorrhage.”</p>

<p>“In cases of true hemophilia one application of 5 grains of coagulen usually suffices to
control the hemorrhage.” “In gastric and intestinal hemorrhage the internal administration
of coagulen will be found effective.” “In bonegrafting, plastic surgery, dentistry and nose
<span class="pagenum" title="291"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>and throat surgery the application of a 10 per cent. solution of Coagulen will be found to
be of valuable assistance in controlling hemorrhage and oozing.”</p>

<p>“It is a non-toxic and non-irritating powder to which a certain amount of sugar has been
added, with a view to ensuring its prompt solution in water or physiological sodium chloride
solution.”</p>

<p><i>Description</i>: “Coagulen is a yellowish granular powder with but slight odor, a sweet taste
and is readily soluble in water or a normal salt solution.” The dry Coagulen obtained
corresponds to the description claimed. Old specimens show the presence of dark brown
particles. Coagulen is marketed in 3 forms: (1) as dry powder containing lactose, which,
it is claimed, facilitates solution in water; (2) as 3 per cent. sterile solution in ampoules<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_137_143" id="FNanchor_137_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_143" class="fnanchor">137</a></span>
(3) tablets.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Study</i>: The alleged thromboplastic activity was tested by the method of
Howell and a modification of this method by Fenger as described in “New and Non­official
Remedies.” In the Howell method dog or cat blood is used, while beef blood at body temperature
is used in Fenger’s method. In other respects the methods are essentially the same.
Briefly these consist of noting the acceleration of coagulation time in a mixture of equal parts
of serum and the thromboplastic agent to which about an equal part of oxalate plasma is
added. Under these conditions cephalin causes clotting in about 1 minute or even less as
compared with 20 to 30 minutes or more of the control.</p>

<p>The effects were compared with freshly prepared cephalin and other thromboplastic agents,
using saline (0.9 per cent. NaCl) as control. The effect of different concentrations was also
studied.</p>

<p>The literature of the manufacturers claims that Coagulen is harmless. This was tested by
making intravenous and subcutaneous injections into guinea-pigs, using saline and cephalin
as controls.</p>

<p>Bloods of 4 different species were used, namely, cat, dog, beef and human. Dog’s
peptonized blood and plasma were also tried.</p>

<p>The 15 different tests that were made in vitro were carried out with 3 different samples
of fresh dry Coagulen (from manufacturer), 2 old samples (one from Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry and one of our own), 3 fresh specimens of sterile solution in ampoules (from
manufacturer), one old specimen and 4 small ampoules (Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry).</p>

<p>The tablets were not tested since these are made from dry Coagulen and the results would
hardly be expected to show anything different.</p>

<p><i>Results</i>: The results obtained may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) 0.1 per cent. to
5 per cent. Coagulen did not accelerate the coagulation time of blood and oxalate plasmas
in the majority of tests any more than the controls of saline, while 0.1 per cent. cephalin
was found to shorten the coagulation time from <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> to <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>

<p>(2) There was no difference between the behavior of old and fresh specimens.</p>

<p>(3) No acceleration of coagulation <i>in vitro</i> was observed even with the highest concentrations
tried, namely 25 and 50 per cent.</p>

<p>(4) Irrigations made with fresh dry coagulen in solution and sterile solution in ampoules
on superficial bleeding from the foot-pads of 3 normal and peptonized dogs and local application
to hemorrhages from dissected femoral arteries and bone and liver wounds of 3 dogs
showed that coagulen was no more active than normal saline.</p>

<p><i>Toxicity</i>: Subcutaneous and intravenous injections of different doses of Coagulen solutions
(fresh ampoules) and dry Coagulen in solution in 8 guinea-pigs produced definite
anaphylactoid symptoms with injury to the circulatory and respiratory systems as indicated
by cardiac dilatation, abdominal congestion and pulmonary hemorrhages, congestion, distention
and sometimes thrombi. On the other hand, the control animals injected with saline
and cephalin remained practically unharmed.</p>

<p><i>Conclusions</i>: The results obtained justify the following conclusions:<br />
(1) Coagulen is entirely inactive as a thromboplastic and hemostatic agent.<br />
(2) Coagulen is distinctly injurious when injected systemically.<br />
(3) The claims of hemostatic efficiency and harmlessness for Coagulen by the manufacturer
appear exaggerated and unjustified.</p>

<p><i>Recommendations</i>: Because of its uncertain composition, the possible dangers when
injected systemically, and its inactivity as a thromboplastic and hemostatic agent when tested
by several different methods, Coagulen merits no recognition as a therapeutic agent for
inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="292"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span>
<p>The detail evidences used as the basis of this brief report concerning Coagulen will be
published shortly in the <i>Journal of Pharmacology</i><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_138_144" id="FNanchor_138_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_144" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> together with the results with other
thromboplastic agents.</p></div>

<p>The preceding report was sent to the American agent for the Society of
Chemical Industry, Sept. 8, 1919.</p>

<p>In reply the American agent, Ciba Co., Inc., on March 22, 1920, sent the
Council “some additional clinical reports on the use of Coagulen-Ciba in the
treatment of Hemorrhages supporting our claims of the merits of Coagulen-Ciba.”</p>

<p>The material submitted by the Ciba Co., contains no objective evidence for
or against the efficiency of Coagulen-Ciba but merely opinions. As a rule
these opinions are favorable though conditional and hedging and quite unconvincing.
Nothing was submitted to offset or challenge the findings of Dr.
Hanzlik’s report.</p>

<p>Since the evidence indicates that Coagulen-Ciba has little, if any, efficacy
as a hemostatic, the Council directed its omission from New and Non­official
Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1920, p.&nbsp;53.</i>)</p>

<h3>FERRIC CACODYLATE OMITTED FROM NEW
AND NONOFFICIAL REMEDIES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the report which appears below,
explaining the omission of ferric cacodylate from New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Iron cacodylate, the ferric salt of cacodylic acid, was admitted to New and
Non­official Remedies in 1917. It is required to contain from 39.7 to 44.9 per
cent. of arsenic (As).</p>

<p>The following statement of the action, uses and dosage of iron cacodylate
appears in the 1920 edition of New and Non­official Remedies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Actions and Uses.&mdash;Ferric Cacodylate has the properties of iron salts and of arsenic.
Its use has been proposed in conditions in which the effects of iron and the mild arsenic
action of cacodylates is desired.</p>

<p>“Dosage.&mdash;from 0.015 to 0.1&nbsp;Gm. (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> to 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grains).”</p></div>

<p>The period for which the iron cacodylate preparations now in New and
Non­official Remedies were accepted coming to an end with the close of 1920,
the Council decided to determine if sufficient evidence for the value of ferric
cacodylate has accumulated to warrant its continued recognition. The following
is the report of the referee of the Committee on Therapeutics to whom the
matter was assigned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As far as the Referee knows, the only claim that Iron Cacodylate has as a therapeutic
agent is that it forms a convenient method for the administration of Iron and Cacodylate
(while there is no reason why a drug should not be given by mouth, usually intramuscularly,
and apparently it has recently been given intravenously). The effects to be expected from
its use are those of iron and arsenic.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="293"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></span>
<p>“Granted that iron and arsenic are valuable therapeutic agents, Iron Cacodylate is not a
satisfactory preparation in which to administer these drugs for the following reasons:</p>

<p>“1. It would appear that Cacodylates are not the best form in which to administer arsenic.
Cacodylates in therapeutic doses exert but a feeble action. Small quantities may be reduced
to cacodyl (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>As<sub>2</sub>, and varying amounts to inorganic arsenic. The amount transformed
to arsenic is apparently unknown and probably varies in different individuals. On these
grounds alone the use of the cacodylates where an arsenic effect is desired seems dubious.</p>

<p>“2. The amounts of iron and cacodylates contained in the doses recommended are small
when compared with the usual doses of either iron or cacodylate. The amount of iron in
the Iron Cacodylate preparations is small, about .0036 gram per dose, while the preparations
admitted to ‘Useful Drugs’ contain much larger amounts per dose recommended. The list
follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="fs100" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">Massa Ferri Carbonates</span></div></td><td class="tac">Fe per dose&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">.042&nbsp;gm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">Pilulae Ferri Carbonates</span></div></td><td class="tac">"&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">.058&nbsp;gm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">Tinctura Ferri Chloride</span></div></td><td class="tac">"&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">.022&nbsp;gm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots4"><span class="item">Ferri et Ammonii Citrae</span></div></td><td class="tac">"&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">.042&nbsp;gm.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“The approximate amount of arsenic in Iron Cacodylate in the commonly recommended
doses varies from .012&nbsp;gm. to 0.024&nbsp;gm., while the amount of arsenic in Sodium Cacodylate in
the recommended doses varies between .021 and .35&nbsp;gms. It would seem that a much more
rational method of administration of these two drugs would be separately, in which case a
better control over the dosage is possible.</p>

<p>“3. The Referee has been unable to secure reliable clinical evidence that Iron Cacodylate
is a serviceable preparation. A search of the available literature for the past fifteen years
has been made, also Drs. Edsall, Longcope, Stengel, Hoover, Phillips and Miller have been
consulted. These physicians know nothing of its use.</p>

<p>“4. In view of the above, it appears to the Referee that Iron Cacodylate is an irrational
and useless method of the administration of iron and arsenic.”</p></div>

<p>The Council adopted the report of the referee and directed that iron cacodylate
be omitted from the 1921 edition of New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>LIBRADOL</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized for publication the following report which
explains why Libradol was found ineligible for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Libradol is manufactured by Lloyd Bros., Cincinnati. According to a circular
(a “readily removable” label) which accompanies the trade package, its “uses”
are: “In colds, croup and acute bronchitis. In local congestions; in lung trouble,
in acute inflammations of this or any other organ, especially if pain or soreness
be present. In lumbago, sciatica, or in rheumatic pains of the joints or
muscles. Applied to the forehead, it induces sleep.”</p>

<p>Libradol is offered in two forms, “Libradol Mild” for infants and supersensitive
persons which is said to be “destitute of drug energy” and Libradol
“Regular” which is “highly medicated,” the “constituents” being “DRACONTIUM,
SANGUINARIA, CEPHAELIS, MELALEUCA, LOBELIA, LAURUS,
CAPSICUM, TOBACCO.”</p>

<p>According to a circular, “The sanitary plasma Libradol” is a “homogeneous,
highly medicated, and exceedingly potent compound, in plastic form,” which
“carries the energies of its drug constituents and the high antiseptic qualities
of Laurus Camphora and Melaleuca.” It is stated: “The Drug Influence of
Libradol is necessarily different from that of any known single member of the
Materia Medica. But yet, no mystery either in medicine or of pharmacy is
claimed as a part of its composition or process of manufacture. It is a thing
peculiar to itself, the result of the study of the drugs from which it is derived and
compounded. These drugs may be studied at leisure by whoever cares to do
so<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="294"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span></p>
<p>The following information bearing on the composition of Libradol was
furnished by Lloyd Brothers in response to a request from the Council to
aid in the consideration of the preparation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“&#8239;‘Compound Lobelia Powder’ has been, since 1852, official in the <i>American Dispensatory</i>,
in the first edition of which (1852) its formula is given, as follows:</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Take of Lobelia, in powder, twelve ounces; Bloodroot and Skunk Cabbage, in powder,
of each, six ounces; Ipecacuanha, eight ounces; Capsicus, in powder, two ounces. Mix them.’</p>

<p>“This preparation came increasingly into demand with the Eclectic profession, the principal
use for which it was first employed (as an emetic), being finally displaced by its local application
in bronchial pneumonia troubles, when sprinkled on a greased cloth and applied to the
chest.”</p>

<p>“In 1898, Dr. Finley Ellingwood petitioned Lloyd Brothers to make for him, in plasma
form, ready for application, a compound carrying the ingredients of the old ‘Compound
Lobelia Powder,’ strengthened by the addition of Melaleuca leucadendron, Laurus camphora
and Nicotiana tabacum. Experiments not very encouraging in a pharmaceutical sense were
made, and it was not until repeated requests had been made that a product was at last
satisfactorily prepared and forwarded to Dr. Ellingwood (1900), with no thought other than
that of serving him personally in his practice. This product he used and commended to his
professional friends, and under his commendation it came into professional demand.”</p></div>

<p>An examination of the information submitted by Lloyd Brothers showed
Libradol to be in conflict with the principles and rules that govern in the
acceptance of articles for New and Non­official Remedies as follows:</p>

<p>Composition (Rule 1).&mdash;The information which has been received gives
little idea of the actual composition of the preparation; for example, the
statement that Libradol “carries the energies of its drug constituents and the
high antiseptic qualities of Laurus Camphora and Melaleuca” gives no indication
as to the part or parts of the Laurus Camphora or Melaleuca employed.
If the statement is correct, that Libradol “is a homogeneous, highly medicated,
and exceedingly potent compound,” it is essential that the several potent
ingredients be stated clearly and not merely hinted at by their qualities. Other
conflicts with Rule 1 might be enumerated, but the foregoing citations state
the direct conflict; and this has not been removed, although an inquiry was
sent to Lloyd Brothers for a statement of the amount of each potent ingredient
in a given quantity of Libradol.</p>

<p>Indirect Advertising (Rule 4).&mdash;The recommendation for the use of Libradol
in the treatment of colds, bronchitis, lumbago, sciatica and rheumatic pains,
which accompanies the trade package, is prone to lead the public to depend on
it in cases where definite treatment is imperative.</p>

<p>Unwarranted Therapeutic Claims (Rule 6).&mdash;Libradol is recommended in
a great variety of conditions and is especially claimed not only to relieve pain,
but to remove the cause of pain. This is explained as follows: “In the study
of the physiological action of many drugs, it was found that the constituent
remedies in this combination exercised a most salutary influence, not only
upon the sensibility of the nerves involved, but upon the capillary circulation
within the diseased area, the muscular structures therein included, and, subsequently,
upon the course of the advancement of the congestive and inflammatory
processes, and upon secretion, exudation, adhesion, induration, hypertrophy,
suppuration and excretion.”</p>

<p>Granting, for the sake of argument, that carefully controlled experimental
clinical evidence were available to substantiate this statement with reference
to a single case of pain, the statement would be misleading when considered as
a general explanation of the preparation’s relieving pain by removing the cause
of pain when taken in connection with the conditions for which it is recommended
and in which pain is even a minor symptom. Still, if pain were
relieved in these cases by removing the cause, the patient would be cured of
the conditions which give rise to the pain, and these include: “Acute pain in
the chest<span class="ell">;..</span>. acute inflammation in the chest<span class="ell">;..</span>. persistent local
pain<span class="ell">;..</span>.” (This might be interpreted as including tuberculosis; pneumonia;
<span class="pagenum" title="295"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></span>cancer, and appendicitis.) “lumbago; sciatica; articular rheumatism”
(gonorrheal infections?).</p>

<p>Name (Rule 8).&mdash;The name, derived from <i>Dolar</i> and <i>Liber</i>, suggests the
claimed action of the preparation (the relief of pain) rather than the drugs said
to be presented by it.</p>

<p>Irrational Composition (Rule 10).&mdash;It is quite possible that Libradol will
relieve pain in certain instances and that the drug constituents present in
Libradol “Regular” make this more effective than “Libradol Mild” which is
“destitute of drug energy”; this, however, is no justification for the use by
physicians of a cataplasm containing or made from skunk cabbage, bloodroot,
ipecac, melaleuca (oil of cajeput?), lobelia, laurus comphora (camphor?),
capsicum and tobacco. The combination is thoroughly irrational and a reminder
of a past century. Further, the Council knows of no evidence to support the
following claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As a stimulant Capsicum has the power of neutralizing depressant remedies like Lobelia
and Tobacco.”</p>

<p>“Our association of its desirable constituents with those of Lobelia, in connection with
the modifying influence of Capsicum, Melaleuca, and Laurus Camphora, permits a more free
use in Libradol than would be possible were it to be employed alone.”</p>

<p>“Capsicum, Melaleuca, and Laurus Camphora in Libradol tend to counteract the excessive
relaxative and depressant effects of Lobelia.”</p>

<p>“The great value of Melaleuca in Libradol is its quality of modifying and controlling
the action of the associated energetic constituents of the drugs Tobacco and Lobelia, which
reduce congestion and inflammation, but which would, unsupported, be too depressant.”</p></div>

<p>Libradol is inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because its composition
is complex, irrational and semi-secret, and because its name and the
unwarranted therapeutic recommendations made for it will lead to its ill-advised
use.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1920, p.&nbsp;65.</i>)</p>

<h3>HELMITOL OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Helmitol is hexa­methylen­amin methylencitrate. It was introduced with the
claim that it was superior to hexa­methylen­amin&mdash;which acts in acid fluids only&mdash;in
that it is equally efficient whether the urine is alkaline or acid.</p>

<p>In 1918 The Bayer Company, which then marketed the product in the United
States, was notified that the Council questioned the claims made for Helmitol
and desired evidence to substantiate them. In 1919 the same notification was
sent the Winthrop Chemical Company, which in the meantime had secured
control of the product. Pending the submission of the evidence, the Council
continued the acceptance of Helmitol for New and Non­official Remedies with
the statement that the actions and uses of hexa­methylen­amin anhydro­methylen­citrate
were those of hexa­methylen­amin.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The following report on Helmitol was made by the referee in charge of
hexa­methylen­amin compounds and preparations, adopted by the Council and
sent the Winthrop Chemical Company:</p>

<p>“Helmitol is a compound of anhydro­methylen­citric acid and hexa­methylen­amin.
It was introduced with the claim that it would be antiseptic even in
alkaline urine. The Council did not entirely trust the evidence, but continued
to list Helmitol in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., merely as a salt of hexa­methylen­amin, until
satisfactory data should become available. These have now been furnished
by Hanzlik (<i>Journal of Urology</i> <b>4</b>:145) who has shown that:</p>

<p>“1. The alkalinity required to split off formaldehyd from anhydro­methylen­citric
acid is greater than exists in the urine, even in advanced ammoniacal
fermentation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="296"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span></p>

<p>“2. Even if any formaldehyd were liberated in ammoniacal fermentation,
it would at once become inactive by combining with ammonia.</p>

<p>“3. Urine after the administration of anhydro­methylen­citric acid actually
putrefies readily.</p>

<p>“4. Less than 5 per cent. of the anhydro­methylen­citric radical reaches the
urine, the remainder being destroyed in the body.</p>

<p>“The only reason for the existence of Helmitol was this claim of antiseptic
action in alkaline and putrefying urines. Since this has been disproved, there
remains no reason for retaining Helmitol in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.; on the contrary, its
retention would only tend to continue the fallacy on which it is based.</p>

<p>“It is, therefore, recommended that Helmitol be no longer listed with New
and Non­official Remedies, and that this report be published, after the usual
submission to the manufacturers.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the recommendation of the report, the Council has
directed the omission of Helmitol from New and Non­official Remedies and
has authorized the publication of this report.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan.

<h3>SPIROCIDE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Spirocide” (The Spirocide Corporation of New York) is advertised as a
new and successful treatment of syphilis by fumigation and inhalation. According
to the information presented to the Council, Spirocide is a mechanical
mixture of metallic mercury 25 per cent., copper sulphate 25 per cent., cypress
cones 20 per cent., henna 20 per cent., nut gall 5 per cent., and dried pomegranate
5 per cent. It is supplied in the form of greenish-gray tablets weighing about
10&nbsp;gm. each, and containing, therefore, about 2.5&nbsp;gm. (about 38 grains) of
mercury. It is sold in packages of six tablets.</p>

<p>The following directions for its use are contained in a pamphlet recently
distributed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Spirocide is administered by means of fumigation and inhalation. The patient is disrobed
to the waist and placed in a light chair, preferably with arms. A pastil or tablet of Spirocide
is placed on a small plate, or open receptacle, after being ignited by holding in a gas or alcohol
flame for a minute or so until it begins to smoulder. The plate with the burning Spirocide is
then placed on the floor between the patient’s feet or just under the chair. A small shelf or
platform between the lower rounds of the chair is an excellent location for the plate containing
the burning mass. When all is in position a sheet should be thrown over the patient and
arranged to enclose the whole. The patient should breathe naturally and inhale the vapor,
which will rise and fill the canopy surrounding him. The treatment will require 15 to 30
minutes, or until the Spirocide is burned up. The patient may complain at first of a slight
choking sensation, and there may be some tendency to cough. This can be removed by raising
the sheet long enough to let in a little clear air. The eyes should be closed or lightly bandaged
to avoid smarting.”</p></div>

<p>Experiments conducted in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory show that
Spirocide, when ignited, burns slowly with consequent volatilization of mercury.
The several organic constituents serve as fuel and the copper sulphate possibly
acts as a regulator of the combustion. During the burning process the cypress
cones, henna, etc., are consumed but most, if not all, the copper remains behind,
the mercury only being vaporized. It is asserted in the advertising pamphlet
that Spirocide is indicated in all stages of syphilis, primary, secondary and
tertiary, and in all its complications or sequelae. In these varying conditions
one tablet daily or every other day is recommended until six treatments have
been taken, though it is stated that “occasionally, depending on the severity
<span class="pagenum" title="297"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></span>or the duration of the disease, it may be wise to give nine treatments,
the last three at intervals of two, three or more days.”</p>

<p>Some of the results which it is claimed are obtained with Spirocide are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the completion of this course of treatment with Spirocide, all signs or evidences of
syphilis are removed, and in ten days to three months all Wassermann tests prove negative.
Any further treatments than the original course of fumigations are rarely needed. Wassermann’s
will be found uniformly negative after a period which, according to the patient, may
vary from ten days to three months. These results have been obtained in cases in which
Salvarsan and kindred preparations have been employed without the slightest benefit.”</p></div>

<p>In a letter to the Council the “scientific observer” of the Spirocide Corporation
declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We do not claim that the vaporization method is new. We do claim, however, that this
combination of mercury produces more rapid volatilization, certain absorption and undoubted
effect than any form of mercury administered by any method known to science without the
usual danger. That this is so we are willing to prove by comparison with other methods both
by ourselves and many observers scattered over the United States<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>To determine the validity of the claims made for Spirocide, the Corporation
was asked to present the evidence which it offered. In reply, the corporation’s
“scientific observer,” Dr. J. Lewengood, submitted 83 case reports from a number
of different observers, including those from military hospitals and a state
institution, and also a reprint of an article published by him in the <i>New York
Medical Journal</i>, Feb. 21, 1920, wherein were reported eight cases which
received “Spirocide Treatment.” In no case were controls with other methods
of mercury administration carried out.</p>

<p>This material the Council sent to two recognized syphil­ographers for an
opinion. One of the consultants reported that of the 83 cases, 20 dealt with
patients who had also received arsphenamin medication and, therefore, these 20
cases could not be considered as evidence concerning the value of Spirocide.
As to the remaining cases, he found on the whole that the history and data
furnished were far from sufficient to warrant the claims made. In many of
the cases emphasis was laid on the Wassermann test, as though this test were
the only thing to be considered in a case of syphilis. He pointed out that in
one case the reaction changed from negative to strongly positive after six
treatments and that in several cases the phenomena reported cannot be explained
by anything else than a desire to get a negative blood test. For example, one
case had Spirocide treatment and a Wassermann, 1 plus, 55 days after; the
author then reports that 19 days later the reaction had become negative and,
therefore, the change must be due to Spirocide. In several of the cases
reported it is even questionable if the patients were syphilitic. The consultant
concluded that the evidence submitted by the Spirocide Corporation failed to
prove the claims made for Spirocide. He pointed out on the other hand that
patients readily become salivated from the use of Spirocide, often after 8 or
10 treatments.</p>

<p>The second consultant replied that in his opinion the claim that Spirocide
produces more “undoubted effect than any form of mercury administered by
any method known to science without the usual danger,” was not substantiated.
He believed that it was not as effective as some other methods, that the dosage
is not as exact, and, therefore, it is not as free from danger when the drug is
pushed.</p>

<p>The Council’s two consultants were also asked whether or not, in their
opinion, the administration of mercury by inhalation is a method which the
Council should endorse to the extent of recognizing a preparation based on
this principle. This inquiry was also sent to the members of the editorial
board of the <i>Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology</i>. Five replies were
received. One advised a thorough study of the different methods of administering
<span class="pagenum" title="298"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span>mercury by inhalation. The other four were opposed to such recognition
on the ground that as the dosage is not exact the effects, therefore, are not
certain.</p>

<p>In consideration of the opinions expressed by its consultants, the Council
declared Spirocide inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because (1)
the claims made for it are unproved and unwarranted, (2) the routine use of
an inexact method for the administration of mercury is detrimental to sound
therapy and (3) the name is not descriptive of its composition, thus failing to
remind the physician who uses these pastils that he is administering metallic
mercury.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 22, 1921.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>DIGIFOLIN-CIBA NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized the publication of the following report, declaring
Digifolin-Ciba inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Digifolin-Ciba is a product of the Society of Chemical Industry of Basle,
Switzerland. It is marketed in the United States by the Ciba Company, 91
Barclay Street, New York City. It is claimed that Digifolin-Ciba is “a preparation
of digitalis leaves that has been freed from the useless and harmful
principles such as Digitonin (saponin), coloring and inert matter, etc., but
does contain all the really valuable, thera­peutically active constituents of the
leaves, namely: digitoxin and digitalein in their natural proportions.” There
is no evidence that digifolin contains all of the glucosides of digitalis as they
exist in the leaf, and it is extremely improbable that this is the case because
one cannot remove saponin without altering the other active principles of
digitalis.</p>

<p>The Ciba Company sends out the following pamphlets relating to Digifolin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“&#8239;‘Concerning Digifolin-Ciba, A New Preparation of Digitalis,’ by C. Hartung, M.D., Ph.D.
Extracts from the work ‘Ueber Digifolin, Ein Neues Digitalis-Praeparat’ in the <i>Munich Medical
Weekly</i>, No. 36, page 1944, 1912.”</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Digitoxin Contents of Digifolin-Ciba,’ by C. Hartung, M.D., Ph.D., Basle, Switzerland.
Reprints from the <i>Pharmaceutical Post</i>, 1913. No. 34, page 357. No. 40, page 431.”</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Pharmacological Tests of Digitalis,’ by M.&nbsp;J. Chevalier, Chef Des Travaux Pratiques de
Pharmacologie et Matiere Medicale, Faculte De Medecine De Paris. Report Presented to the
Societe de Therapeutique at Their Meeting, May 28, 1913.”</p></div>

<p>In the reprint “Concerning Digifolin, ‘Ciba.’&#8239;” Hartung lays stress on the
presence of harmful and inert substances present in the leaf and galenical
preparations with the direct or implied statement that digifolin has an advantage
in that these are absent from it. This is misleading. It is true that Boehm
whom Hartung cites, found saponin to be irritating, but Boehm states that
it required 100&nbsp;mg. per kilogram of body weight to induce vomiting after
its oral administration. Furthermore, saponin is present in traces only in
infusion of digitalis, so that the therapeutic dose contains a wholly negligible
amount of it.</p>

<p>The following occurs in “Pharmacological Tests of Digitalis,” by M.&nbsp;J.
Chevalier:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hartung’s Digifolin merits our attention, especially because it seems to possess all the
pharmacodynamic properties of galenic preparations of digitalis without showing any of their
disadvantages.”</p></div>

<p>This claim scarcely needs comment, since it is well established that the
chief “disadvantages” of digitalis are inherent in the principles which produce
<span class="pagenum" title="299"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></span>the desired effects of digitalis and may be avoided to a large extent by a carefully
regulated dosage of any digitalis preparation. In short, the advertising
for Digifolin asserts that this digitalis preparation has all the advantages of
digitalis itself, but none of its disadvantages. This claim has been refuted so
frequently that manufacturers must be aware that it is untenable. Further
the claims now made for Digifolin are essentially those made nearly four years
ago at which time the attention of the American agent was called to their
unwarranted character.</p>

<p>The Council declared Digifolin-Ciba inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because the therapeutic claims advanced for it are misleading and
unwarranted.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 2, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>SOME OF LOESER’S INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized the publication of the following report on
“Loeser’s Intravenous Solution of Hexamethylenamin,” “Loeser’s Intravenous
Solution of Hexamethylenamin and Sodium Iodid,” “Loeser’s Intravenous Solution
of Sodium Salicylate,” “Loeser’s Intravenous Solution of Salicylate and
Iodid,” “Loeser’s Intravenous Solution of Sodium Iodid” and “Loeser’s Intravenous
Solution of Mercury Bichlorid,” put out by the New York Intravenous
Laboratory, Inc.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>The intravenous solutions of “Hexamethylenamin,” “Hexamethylenamin and
Sodium Iodid,” “Sodium Salicylate,” “Sodium Salicylate and Sodium Iodid,”
“Sodium Iodid” and “Mercuric Chlorid” marketed by the New York Intravenous
Laboratory, Inc., are solutions of official substances sold under their official
names. They would, therefore, be outside the scope of the Council, were it
not that special and general therapeutic claims are made for them. Such
special claims, for instance, are contained in an advertisement in the <i>Illinois
Medical Journal</i> for Oct. 20, 1920, which gives, under the various drugs, a list
of diseases in which the drugs are said to be “indicated.” The Council is unable
to agree with some of these recommendations. The fundamental objection,
however, is the general claim of superiority and safety of the intravenous
method.</p>

<p>The intravenous solutions named above would naturally have little sale if
such special claims were not made for them. While the claims may not be
made directly, they are carried by such display phrases as “For the progressive
physician seeking improved clinical results” and “A safe practical office
technique.”</p>

<p>The Council continues to hold that intravenous medication, generally, is not
as safe as oral medication even with relatively harmless substances (a fact
again illustrated by the results of Hanzlik and Karsner, 1920, <i>Journal Pharmacology
and Experimental Therapeutics</i>, <b>14</b>, 379), and that it does not give
“improved clinical results” except under rather narrowly confined circumstances&mdash;namely,
if the drug undergoes decomposition in the alimentary tract, if it is
not absorbed, if it causes serious direct local reaction or if time is an urgent
element. Each intravenous preparation for which advantage over oral administration
is claimed, directly or by implication, must be examined from these
points of view.</p>

<p>The Council has recognized intravenous preparations which satisfied these
requirements. It is evident, however, that hexa­methylen­amin, sodium iodid
and sodium salicylate do not. When given orally they do not undergo material
decomposition in the digestive tract, they are rapidly absorbed, they cause
no direct local reaction, and in the conditions in which they are used the hour
<span class="pagenum" title="300"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span>or so which is required for absorption is immaterial, especially as they are used
continuously for some time. Mercuric chlorid does indeed produce some local
irritation, but there is as yet no convincing evidence that its intravenous injection
causes less injury than oral administration. More experience under controlled
conditions is needed before the intravenous use of mercuric chlorid can be
approved. Especially objectionable are the fixed proportion mixtures of sodium
iodid with sodium salicylate and with hexa­methylen­amin. The dosage of all three
drugs has to be adapted to individual conditions. This is impossible when giving

<h3>“NATIONAL IODINE SOLUTION” NOT
ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“National Iodine Solution” is a proprietary sold by the National Drug Co.,
Philadelphia, Pa. From inquiries received by the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry it is evident that the product is extensively brought to the attention
of physicians by means of circulars. The name implies that it is a solution
of iodin and the inference is given that it has the advantages of iodin without
the disadvantages.</p>


<h5>COMPOSITION</h5>

<p>In view of the foregoing, the Council took up the investigation of “National
Iodine Solution,” and in turn asked the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory to
analyze it. The chemist’s report follows:</p>

<p>According to the label of National Iodine Solution, “each fluidounce represents
three grains Proteo-albuminoid compound of iodin (National)”; also
an alcohol declaration of 7 per cent. is made. Otherwise no information is
given as to the composition either of the “solution” or of “Proteo-albuminoid
compound of Iodine.”</p>

<p>Each bottle contained about 115&nbsp;c.c. (nearly 4 ounces) of a yellowish
solution, acid in reaction, having an odor resembling witch hazel; its specific
gravity at 25&nbsp;C. was 0.9860. Qualitative tests indicated the presence of zinc,
alcohol, sulphate, an iodin compound (the solution gave tests which indicated
a very small amount of free iodin; most of the iodin was in the form of
ordinary iodid), a small amount of vegetable extractives, and traces of aluminum
and potassium. If any protein was present, it was in amounts too small to be
identified, though a small amount of a nitrogenous compound was present.
The amount of solids in “National Iodine Solution” was equivalent to 0.72 per
cent, and the amount of ash, to 0.2 per cent. Quantitative estimations yielded
the following:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Alcohol (by volume)</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">7.0&#8199;&#8199;&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="301"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a></span></p>
<p>The above findings indicate that each 100&nbsp;c.c. contains about 7&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol,
0.5 gram of zinc sulphate U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>+7H<sub>2</sub>O.), 0.03 gram of iodin, 0.01
gram of protein (calculated as such from nitrogen times the factor 6.36) and
some hamamelis water. Expressed in equivalent apothecary terms, each fluidounce
contains essentially:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Zinc sulphate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>&#8199;</span>&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">grains</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>This amount of alcohol is equivalent to about 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> fluidrams of witch hazel
water. Although the label states that each fluidounce contains three grains
of “proteo-albuminoid compound of iodine,” yet the sum of the protein (calculated
from nitrogen content) and iodin components is equivalent to less than
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub></span> grain.</p>

<p>“National Iodine Solution” appears to be very similar to “Gonocol” (The
National Drug Co., Philadelphia, Pa.), which was analyzed by the Bureau
of Chemistry of the U.&nbsp;S. Department of Agriculture. The bureau stated
that “it [Gonocol] consisted essentially of an aqueous solution of zinc sulphate,
hamamelis water, a small amount of alcohol, 0.38 grain of iodin, and 0.36
grain of protein per fluidounce.”</p>

<p>It is evident that “National Iodine Solution” is not a solution of free elementary
iodin as the name suggests; instead it appears to be a solution of
zinc sulphate in witch hazel water containing less than 0.03 per cent. of combined
iodin and <i>not more than a trace of free iodin</i>. “National Iodine Solution”
is one more to be added to that already long list of proprietaries which makes
capital of the high esteem in which physicians hold iodin.</p>


<h5>THE CLAIMS</h5>

<p>An advertising circular sent to physicians begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Dear Doctor</i>: We beg to suggest a line of treatment while using National Iodine Solution
which our many years of experience has proven to us to give the best and quickest results in
the treatment of inflammation of the urethral tract&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>In it are given directions for the treatment of “acute gonorrhea, male,”
“anterior urethritis,” “anterior-posterior urethritis,” “ardor urinæ and chordee,”
etc., by means of National Iodine Solution and other proprietaries of the
National Drug Company’s make. In fact the solution is claimed to be “Indicated
in All Conditions of Urethra Accompanied by a Discharge.”</p>


<h5>COMMENT AND CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>The therapeutic claims made for “National Iodine Solution” are unwarranted.
Such a solution is not indicated in all conditions of the urethra accompanied
by discharge. The advice contained in the circular is equivalent to mail-order
treatment of gonorrhea.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note that the claims for an identical or a similar solution
prepared by the National Drug Company as a treatment for gonorrhea and
intended for use by the laity, has been adjudged misbranded by the federal
authorities (Notice of Judgment No. 8150, issued Jan. 25, 1921) in that it
misled and deceived the purchaser or purchasers thereof in the statements
regarding the therapeutic or curative effects of the article, which falsely
and fraudulently represent it to be indicated in all conditions of the urethra
accompanied with a discharge, “whereas in truth and in fact it was not.”</p>

<p>The Council would emphasize that if physicians give heed to advertising
such as that sent out by the National Drug Company for this preparation the
medical profession cannot with good grace protest against the routine treatment
of venereal diseases by quacks and “patent medicine” venders.&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 4, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>MON-ARSONE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Mon-Arsone is offered by the Harmer Laboratories Company as “a new
and non-toxic arsenical for the treatment of syphilis.” In the advertisements
for Mon-Arsone it has been claimed that with this drug “the toxic, corrosive
and uncertain reactions attending the use of arsphen­amine have been entirely
eliminated” and that “it has a therapeutic value equal to arsphen­amine, but
extensive case reports fail to record the slightest toxic reaction following its
use.”</p>

<p>According to the manufacturers, Mons-Arsone is disodium­ethyl­arsonate, the
sodium salt of ethyl­arsonic acid, derived from arsenic acid by replacement
of one hydroxyl group by the ethyl group&mdash;AsO(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Mons-Arsone
is related to sodium cacodylate, which is the sodium salt of dimethyl-arsenic
acid&mdash;AsO(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH&mdash;derived from arsenic acid by replacement of two
hydroxyl groups by two methyl groups. Ethyl­arsonic acid and its potassium
salt were described by La <span class="nowrap">Coste<a name="FNanchor_139_145" id="FNanchor_139_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_145" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> more than thirty-five years ago, and the use
of the sodium salt of methyl­arsonic acid was proposed in France some years
ago. The Harmer Laboratories Company claims originality for Mons-Arsone
in that it was the first to prepare the sodium salt of ethyl­arsonic acid and to
propose its therapeutic use.</p>

<p>It was reported several years ago by <span class="nowrap">Castelli<a name="FNanchor_140_146" id="FNanchor_140_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_146" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> that sodium cacodylate and
the sodium salt of methyl arsenic acid were devoid of effect on experimental
trypanosomiasis and spirochete infections. Careful clinical observations in
this country by H.&nbsp;J. <span class="nowrap">Nichols<a name="FNanchor_141_147" id="FNanchor_141_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_147" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> and H.&nbsp;N. <span class="nowrap">Cole<a name="FNanchor_142_148" id="FNanchor_142_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_148" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> have demonstrated the
inefficacy of sodium cacodylate in the treatment of human syphilis.</p>

<p>Animal experiments carried out in the U.&nbsp;S. Hygienic Laboratory by
Voegtlin and <span class="nowrap">Smith<a name="FNanchor_143_149" id="FNanchor_143_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_149" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> show that Mon-Arsone is devoid of any practical trypanocidal
action. Thus the “therapeutic ratio” (the ratio of the minimal effective
dose to the lethal dose) was about 1, that is, it was effective thera­peutically
only in approximately fatal doses; the therapeutic ratio for arsphen­amine in
similar conditions was 17, and that of neo­arsphen­amine, 28.</p>

<p>The findings that sodium dimethylarsenate (sodium cacodylate), sodium
methyl­arsenate, and sodium ethyl­arsenate are devoid of any practical trypanocidal
action and the conclusion that sodium cacodylate is inefficient in the treatment
of human syphilis does not prove that Mon-Arsone is without effect on the
disease. These findings, however, certainly demand convincing therapeutic
evidence to warrant the recommendation for the use of the drug in the treatment
of syphilis&mdash;particularly because the drug is proposed as a substitute
for arsphen­amine, the value of which is established.</p>

<p>When the Council first took up the consideration of Mon-Arsone, the only
evidence for the claim that it “has a therapeutic value at least equal to that
of arsphen­amine” consisted, with one exception, of reports from those who
had experimented with the drug for the Harmer Laboratories Company,
including a report by B.&nbsp;L. Wright, L.&nbsp;A. Kennell, and L.&nbsp;M. Hussey<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_144_150" id="FNanchor_144_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_150" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> the latter
of the Harmer Laboratories Company. These reports appeared to show that
the administration of Mon-Arsone caused less reaction than arsphen­amine, and
that the immediate effects, judged by clinical symptoms and the response to
<span class="pagenum" title="303"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span>the Wassermann test, appeared to be good. These trials extended over too
short a period of time to permit judgment as to the permanence of the results.
A report by an independent observer seemed to indicate that Mon-Arsone does
not have the sterilizing action on syphilitic lesions which it is usually believed
arsphen­amine exercises.</p>

<p>After examining the available evidence, the Council advised the Harmer
Laboratories Company that the claim that Mon-Arsone has a therapeutic value
equal to arsphen­amine appeared unwarranted; that, in the opinion of the Council,
Mon-Arsone should not be used except under conditions that justify the
experimental trial of an unproved drug, and should not be used in a routine
way until the permanence of its effects has been established; and consequently
any advertising propaganda for the drug by the Harmer Laboratories Company
was to be deprecated.</p>

<p>In its reply the Harmer Laboratories Company admitted that its advertising
claim, that Mon-Arsone was at least equal to arsphen­amine thera­peutically,
had been based on reports on fifty cases and on additional reports that were
beginning to come in at that time. The Harmer Laboratories Company submitted
a list of hospitals and physicians using Mon-Arsone. A letter of
inquiry sent by the Council to those who, according to the names in the list
supplied by the Harmer Laboratories Company, had used Mon-Arsone, brought
seven replies.</p>

<p>The clinical evidence contained in these replies was to the effect that
Mon-Arsone had been used in the various types of syphilis and that there
was a certain beneficial effect, both clinically and as shown by the Wassermann
reaction. In certain instances the Wassermann reaction changed from a four
plus to a negative reaction. The reports showed that the efficiency of Mon-Arsone
as compared with that of arsphen­amine preparations has not been
adequately studied. One physician who has used Mon-Arsone extensively reports
that in many of the cases treated there seemed to be nearly as good results
from the use of Mon-Arsone as is frequently obtained in the use of arsphen­amine.
He reports, however, that it was necessary in eleven out of one hundred
cases to change from Mon-Arsone to neo­arsphen­amine.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that there is definite lack of evidence to show that
Mon-Arsone is the equal of arsphen­amine thera­peutically, and because of
the reports that in some cases it is inferior, Mon-Arsone should not be used
in the treatment of syphilis generally until its therapeutic status has been more
rigidly investigated and conclusive evidence of its superiority to arsphen­amine
preparations obtained.</p>

<p>The Council voted not to admit Mon-Arsone to New and Non­official Remedies
and reaffirmed its conclusion that the claim that Mon-Arsone has a therapeutic
value equal to that of arsphen­amine is premature and unwarranted; that
Mon-Arsone should not be used except under conditions that justify the
experimental trial of an unproved drug; and that the advertising propaganda
for the drug by the Harmer Laboratories Company is to be deprecated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the preceding report was sent to the Harmer Laboratories Company,
the firm submitted a reply in which it was stated:</p>

<p>1. That in certain instances patients improved under Mon-Arsone who,
previously, had not improved under arsphen­amine, and that this should be taken
to offset the report of the one hundred cases in which the use of Mon-Arsone
had to be abandoned in 11 per cent. of the cases.</p>

<p>2. That the Harmer Laboratories Company has abandoned the claim that
Mon-Arsone is thera­peutically equal to arsphen­amine and that it now furnishes
the drug to such men as care to use it simply on the basis of its special and
useful characteristics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="304"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a></span></p>
<p>The Council heartily endorses the recent warning against the use of untried
medicaments which was issued by the U.&nbsp;S. Public Health Service<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_145_151" id="FNanchor_145_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_151" class="fnanchor">145</a></span></p>

<p>Since the Council’s report was prepared a report on the effects of Mon-Arsone
on experimental syphilis has been published by Nichols<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_146_152" id="FNanchor_146_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_152" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> from the
Division of Laboratories, Army Medical School, which concludes:</p>

<p>1. Disodium-ethyl­arsinate, or mon-arsone, tested on rabbits infected with
syphilis shows no spirocheticidal power. The tissues are fatally poisoned as
soon as or before the spirochetes are affected.</p>

<p>“2. For its practical use in syphilis there is no such germicidal basis as
exists in case of the arsphen­amine group.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June

<h3>OXYL-IODIDE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>“Oxyl-Iodide” (Eli Lilly and Co.) is said to be the hydroiodid of cinchophen
and the claim is made that it exerts the effects of cinchophen and of
iodid. Because of inquiries which have been received the Council decided to
determine the eligibility of “Oxyl-Iodide” for New and Non­official Remedies.
Dr. P.&nbsp;J. Hanzlik&mdash;formerly Associate Professor of Pharmacology at Western
Reserve University School of Medicine, now Professor of Pharmacology at
Leland Stanford Junior University Medical School&mdash;who has made a study of
the action of salicylates and cinchophen, was asked to report on the therapeutic
value and the rationality of “Oxyl-Iodide.” This he consented to do and
his report appears below.</p>

<p>After considering Doctor Hanzlik’s report, the Council declared “Oxyl-Iodide”
inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because it is an irrational
combination, marketed under claims that are unproved and consequently
unwarranted.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Oxyl-Iodide,” marketed by Eli Lilly &amp; Co., is claimed to be the hydroiodid
of phenyl­cinchoninic acid, containing 33 per cent. of iodin and 67 per cent.
of phenyl­cinchoninic acid (cinchophen). Its solubility resembles that of cinchophen,
being low in water and acid mediums, and higher in the presence of
alkalis. Whether “oxyl-iodide” is decomposed into its constituents in the
presence of alkalis does not appear to have been determined. However, if this
were the case, the intestine, after administration of “oxyl-iodide,” would contain
cinchophen and sodium iodid in the same forms as if these agents were
administered individually so that nothing would be gained by administering
“oxyl-iodide.” Being, like cinchophen, practically insoluble in acid mediums,
“oxyl-iodide” would have no advantage over the latter so far as gastric irritation
is concerned.</p>


<h5>DOSAGE</h5>

<p>The dosage advised is from one to three tablets containing 3 grains (0.2&nbsp;gm.)
each of “oxyl-iodide.” The total dosage would depend on the condition to be
treated. In rheumatic fever, which requires a full therapeutic or so-called,
“toxic” dose of cinchophen, about 12 to 13&nbsp;gm. would be administered intensively.
Since each tablet of “oxyl-iodide” contains 0.13&nbsp;gm. of cinchophen,
the total number of tablets of “oxyl-iodide” required would be 100, or two and
one-half bottles of forty tablets each. At the same time the patient would
receive 6.6&nbsp;gm. of iodin (as iodid). This might be distinctly objectionable
because of the production of the disagreeable symptoms of iodism in some persons,
<span class="pagenum" title="305"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></span>and indicates that the fixed proportion of the iodin constituent would be
objectionable.</p>

<p>Even a smaller dosage, such as 5&nbsp;gm. of cinchophen, which gives partial
relief in rheumatism and similar conditions, would still require a patient to
take a full bottle, or forty tablets, of “oxyl-iodide,” and at the same time about
2.7&nbsp;gm. of iodin would have to be ingested.</p>

<p>Furthermore, rheumatic fever, the arthritides, gout and related conditions
in which cinchophen is indicated do not require iodid. Therefore, “oxyl-iodide”
would not be the remedy of choice in these conditions, and its use would be
irrational and illogical.</p>


<h5>ACTIONS</h5>

<p>No data on the pharmacologic actions of “oxyl-iodide” are presented in the
manufacturer’s literature. Presumably, the compound would exhibit the actions
of its individual components, i.&nbsp;e., cinchophen and iodin (as iodid), though
probably less efficiently, owing to its low solubility. This is also indicated by
the following statements of the manufacturer: “The analgesic action of ‘oxyl-iodide’
is gradual. A word of caution is necessary to those who may expect
immediate relief from pain.” Therefore, why use “oxyl-iodide” in place of
more dependable analgesics, such as salicylate or cinchophen. The following
statements appear far-fetched: “There is a stimulation of the endocrines which
is perhaps more marked in the thyroid gland, although it is probably shared
by the pituitary and other glands which function in a chain-like control<span class="ell">...</span>.
There is stimulation of cells with increased flow of secretion, visibly demonstrated
by the nasal mucous membrane after ‘oxyl-iodide’ has been taken for
some time. The general action on mucous membranes favors elimination of
toxins and waste products.”</p>

<p>It is probable that “oxyl-iodide” acts as a uric acid eliminant, though there
is no reason to suppose that it is more effective than cinchophen alone. No
data are given for this in the manufacturer’s literature.</p>


<h5>USES</h5>

<p>Successful use of “oxyl-iodide” is claimed in brachial and sciatic neuritis,
lumbago, muscular rheumatism, arthritis deformans, chronic arthritis (“<span class="ell">..</span>. in
some instances were apparently cured”), subacute bronchitis, circumflex
neuritis, traumatic orchitis, eczema and rheumatism. However, a careful reading
of the protocols of seven cases, representing these conditions, gives an
unfavorable impression as to the real contribution to the recovery by, or value
received from, “oxyl-iodide.” Summarized, the opinions as quoted by the manufacturers
in support of their claims for “oxyl-iodide” are briefly as follows:</p>

<p>Case 1. “Of course, the case is not complete yet, but I am looking for continued
betterment.”</p>

<p>Case 2. “For two weeks past her improvement has been marvelous.”</p>

<p>Case 3. “The joints are still enlarged and we do not hope to clear them
entirely<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>Case 4. “Undoubtedly, removal of the kidney had much to do with improvement.”</p>

<p>Case 5. “I think I have gotten very good results.”</p>

<p>Case 6. “Some apparent benefit.”</p>

<p>Case 7. “She is practically free from pain, and the muscle and joint stiffness
is now slight.”</p>

<p>These inconclusive opinions certainly do not agree with the favorable
impression which other portions of the manufacturer’s literature create. If the
factor of natural recovery in the conditions represented by these seven cases
<span class="pagenum" title="306"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></span>is given due weight, little, if anything, is left to the credit of “oxyl-iodide.”
Such clinical evidence as is supplied by the manufacturer indicates that the
therapeutic efficiency of “oxyl-iodide” is doubtful, and not an improvement over
either cinchophen or iodid.</p>


<h5>IODISM</h5>

<p>Iodism cannot be avoided by the use of “oxyl-iodide,” for the manufacturer’s
literature states that “the dosage of ‘oxyl-iodide’ may be pushed to iodism as
manifested by skin symptoms<span class="ell">...</span>. To avoid iodism there should be an
occasional interruption of treatment.” “Oxyl-iodide,” therefore, has no advantage
over ordinary sodium iodid to avoid iodism. Usually, the conditions which
require cinchophen do not require the simultaneous administration of iodids, and
vice versa. If administration of iodid and cinchophen together should be indicated
or desirable, these can be given separately with the added advantage that
the iodid can be easily reduced or withdrawn in case iodism supervenes, and
the cinchophen could be continued if necessary. Since conditions do not arise
frequently enough to warrant the use of iodid and cinchophen together, the
existence of such a product as “oxyl-iodide” is unwarranted.</p>

<p>Finally, the manufacturer himself recognizes that phenyl­cinchoninic acid
(cinchophen) can take the place of “oxyl-iodide.” Under “dosage,” the circular
states: “A few patients may be idiosyncratic to the iodides and find
they cannot take ‘oxyl-iodide.’ For the latter chloroxyl, the hydrochloride of
phenyl­cinchoninic acid, is recommended.” The action of the hydrochlorid of
phenyl­cinchoninic acid does not differ, of course, from that of cinchophen. The
difficulties of assigning a clear-cut, definite, therapeutic rôle to “oxyl-iodide”
in order to justify its existence, alongside well-known and tried remedies are
self-evident.</p>


<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>

<p>“Oxyl-iodide” is pharmacologically and thera­peutically an illogical, irrational
and unjustified substitute for cinchophen and iodids. The conditions
which require the administration of cinchophen do not as a rule require the
administration of iodid and vice versa. If it is desirable to secure the effects
of iodid and cinchophen together, these can be more conveniently and advantageously
administered as separate agents, permitting in that way a better control
of their actions. This cannot be accomplished with “oxyl-iodide,” in which
the proportion of iodid and cinchophen are fixed. Symptoms of iodism cannot
be avoided by the administration of “oxyl-iodide.” The objective evidences for
its actions and uses are totally lacking; and the clinical opinions concerning its
therapeutic benefits in different disease conditions are inconclusive and hedging,
and, if anything, contradictory to the favorable impressions which the
language of the advertising matter is likely to create.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal

<p>In the advertising the “Cascara” of the label is replaced by the indefinite
term “Cascarin” and the “Gingerine <i>q.&nbsp;s.</i>” by “Carminative Antigripe <i>q.&nbsp;s.</i>” Flint,
Eaton and Company informed the Council that “Carminative Antigripe is C.&nbsp;P.
Sodium Sulphite of which each tablet contains <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain.” The tablets were
treated with dilute hydrochloric acid and the odor of sulphur dioxid became
apparent. This shows that the company’s statement to the Council, that the
tablets contain a sulphite, is correct and the formula on the label is incorrect.</p>

<p>In the advertising for this preparation we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A careful study of this formula [which formula? That on the label or that in the general
advertising?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Council</span>] will reveal the outstanding fact that, while there are several
drugs employed, each ingredient is there for a purpose and all do splendid teamwork. If your
patient is constipated because the stomach is not sufficiently energetic, the Quassia stimulates
that organ to an increased secretion of digestive fluids and sets it to working normally. If the
liver be sluggish, the Chionanthus and Wahoo prompt it to increased activity. Chionanthus
has no superior for producing a sustained healthy hepatic condition. Should the bowels be
slow and uncertain, the small doses of Aloin, Cascarin and Podophyllin stimulate to free
peristaltic action, while the Nux Vomica sets the nervous system right. We use an effective
Antigripe so that there is no griping.”</p></div>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that a complex mixture of drugs in fixed proportions
can have the actions claimed for Quassia Compound Tablets. As regards the
claim that “Chionanthus has no superior for producing a sustained healthy
hepatic condition,” it was brought out in a report of the Council on “Some
Unimportant Drugs” (Reports of Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1912,
p.&nbsp;36) that the “claims for this remedy [Chionanthus] are not supported by
experimental evidence and the clinical reports of its use fail to show indications
of discriminating critical observation. It is not noticed by most pharmacologic
authorities.”</p>

<p>Of Wahoo (Euonymus N.&nbsp;F.) the “Epitome of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. and N.&nbsp;F.” says:
“<i>Actions and Uses.</i>&mdash;Obsolete cathartic; toxic digitalis effects. <i>Caption</i>: the
uncertain absorption of this drug makes its use inadvisable.”</p>

<p>Quassia Compound Tablets (Flint, Eaton and Company) are inadmissible
to New and Non­official Remedies because (1) they contain drugs of unproved
value; (2) their composition is needlessly complex, and, therefore irrational;
(3) unwarranted therapeutic claims are made for them; (4) the name is misleading
and not descriptive of their composition, and (5) the statement of their
composition is indefinite and incorrect.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July

<h3>TOXICIDE</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized the publication of the following report:</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Toxicide (Toxicide Laboratories, Chicago) is alleged to be a remedy which
“increases systemic resistance,” is “used for immunizing against septic infections”
and “is indicated in any case of septic infection, capable of inducing
inflammation and pus formation, regardless of location or kind of tissue
involved.” The following statements bearing on the composition of the preparation
are furnished by the manufacturers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Toxicide contains Lachesis 12X, Tarantula 6X, Psorinum (special) 15X, Silicia 6X and
Excipient q. s. (the excipient is sweet milk).</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="308"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a></span>
<p>“These remedies are combined in the sweet milk and put through a process of development,
which produces the curative agent which we call ‘Toxicide’ <span class="ell">..</span>.</p>

<p>“Put up in tablet form, sugar coated and colored red.”</p></div>

<p>No information is given as to the proportions, either relative or actual, of
the ingredients. Neither is any information given regarding the “process
of development” to which the mixture is subjected, nor the amount of the
finished mixture which is contained in Toxicide tablets.</p>

<p>The Toxicide Laboratories present the following “theory”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In combining these remedies and processing with milk, we develop a latent immunizing
active principle, which usually controls the most virulently, active, septic infections promptly.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/308.jpg" width="400" height="195" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (reduced) of an advertisement of the “originator” of Toxicide;
it ran for many months in the program of a burlesque theater located in Ruckel’s neighborhood.</div>
</div>

<p>There is no evidence, however, that any effort has been made to demonstrate
the presence of a “latent immunizing active principle” by scientific methods
of modern immunology. The following claims for the use of Toxicide appear
on the label:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Acne, boils, carbuncles, furuncles and abscesses of the most virulent types usually begin
to show improvement within 4 to 12 hours after beginning administration.</p>

<p>“In badly infected wounds, Toxicide will check the further destruction of live tissue and
should always be given for a few days before and after operations on pus cases.</p>

<p>“For gunshot wounds and other conditions difficult to sterilize or drain, Toxicide is the
ideal remedy.</p>

<p>“For abscesses existing or threatened in any obscure location, the middle ear, the mastoid,
the frontal or any accessory sinuses, Toxicide is of inestimable value.</p>

<p>“If administered early, in fractures, compound or simple, or for laceration and other
injuries, inflammation, swelling, soreness and destruction of tissue will be greatly mitigated.”</p></div>

<p>In support of these claims there are offered letters from physicians who
have used Toxicide with good results. None of these testimonials present
evidence that the reported effects were due to Toxicide. The asserted&mdash;and
highly improbable&mdash;action of Toxicide could be determined only by an extensive
series of carefully controlled clinical trials&mdash;and such evidence is entirely
lacking. In fact, the claims appear to have no better basis than the coincidence
which is stated to have led to the discovery of the “remedy”; namely, that a
boil on the neck disappeared shortly after the administration of Toxicide!</p>

<p>The Council finds Toxicide inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
because (1) the identity and amount of the potent constituent or constituents
have not been furnished; (2) the preparation is advertised indirectly to the
public; (3) the name “Toxicide” is thera­peutically suggestive, and (4) the therapeutic
claims, being unsubstantiated by evidence, are unwarranted.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Editorial Comment.</span>&mdash;It seems rather preposterous that a scientific body,
such as the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, should have to waste its time
in investigating and reporting on such an obviously unscientific product as
“Toxicide.” So long, however, as there are physicians who will take preparations
of this sort seriously, the Council feels that it is its duty to report on such
products. The problem, in fact, was well stated in a letter addressed to the
editor some months ago by the secretary of a county medical society who had
just received a visit from a representative of the Toxicide Laboratories and
who sent to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> some of the advertising matter that he had received
from the same source. This physician wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not wish to trouble you with this kind of material, usually deposited
safely in my waste paper basket, but the enclosed was handed to me today
by a ‘bird’ who is calling on all the doctors and making strong statements.
When he claimed that ‘Toxicide’ is being used in the Presbyterian Hospital,
Chicago, and that the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry is considering
it seriously, etc., etc., I wish to know whether I am missing any real good
thing. If it has any real virtue, I would like to know about it, but if it has
not, it seems to me that something ought to be done to head him off as some
doctors are sure to fall for some of it.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="310"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a></span></p>
<p>The Toxicide Laboratories is, apparently, merely a trade name used by the
alleged originator of “Toxicide,” J.&nbsp;F. Ruckel, M.D. According to our records,
Ruckel was born in 1860 and was graduated by the Chicago Homeopathic Medical
College in 1886. He claims to have originated Toxicide about twenty years
ago and to have prescribed it “in over 3,000 cases.” In addition to Toxicide, the
Toxicide Laboratories also put out “Dianasiac for Nymphomania and Satyriasis”
and “Somnosine for Insomnia.”]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 8, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>PIL. MIXED TREATMENT (CHICHESTER)</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report:</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>“Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester)” is a proprietary preparation of the
Hillside Chemical Co., Newburgh, N.&nbsp;Y. It is sold in the form of pills, each
said to contain <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span> grain of mercuric iodid and 5 grains of potassium iodid.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Council examined the therapeutic claims advanced for this
preparation and found that they were unwarranted, exaggerated and misleading.
It found, also, many misleading statements in regard to the product itself.
Furthermore, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory found the pills to be “short
weight” in potassium iodid content.</p>

<p>At the time that the Council examined Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester),
a dermatologist of recognized standing, to whom the “literature” for this
product had been submitted for an opinion, made the following report:</p>

<p>“Assuming that this pill contains what is claimed for it, one-twentieth (<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span>)
of a grain of biniodid of mercury and five (5) grains of potassium iodid, it
presents neither an original nor a very useful formula.</p>

<p>“The literature furnished by the company abounds in suggestions that the
mixture, as they prepare it, represents some unusual potency which is not
possessed by the ordinary mixture of these same drugs in the same proportion.
These suggestions may of course be dismissed without consideration. There
is nothing mysterious in a mixture of potassium iodid and biniodid of mercury
and this formula is no more entitled to special consideration than any other pill
or tablet of the same composition prepared by any reputable pharmaceutical
firm.</p>

<p>“The formula of this pill, however, does not represent a good combination.
It is offered for use both during the active secondary period of syphilis and
for tertiary lesions. The pill does not contain enough mercury to be an efficient
remedy for secondary syphilis and not enough potassium iodid to be satisfactory
in the treatment of tertiary lesions. It is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red
herring. A patient with secondary syphilis should not be dosed all the time
with potassium iodid and for the treatment of tertiary lesions he should have
a very much larger quantity of potassium iodid than can be given in these
pills without giving toxic doses of mercury.</p>

<p>“The statement that this pill ‘does not impair the appetite nor disturb
digestion and is well borne by patients who cannot tolerate iodids otherwise
administered’ is a bald claim which cannot be justified by experience. The most
unsatisfactory way of administering potassium iodid is in solid form. A patient
who can stand potassium iodid in pill form, as it is furnished in this preparation,
can stand it in any form in which it is ever administered.</p>

<p>“In short this preparation is neither agreeable nor efficient. The greatest
objection to it is its inefficiency, for it is offered as an adequate preparation for
the treatment of syphilis in all of its stages, whereas it is neither satisfactory for
the treatment of secondary syphilis nor of tertiary lesions.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="311"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a></span></p>
<p>During the fourteen years which have elapsed since the Council’s first examination
of Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester), arsphenamin has been added
to the syphil­ographer’s arma­ment­arium and much has been learned about
syphilis and its treatment. While there exist differences of opinion as to the
exact value of arsphenamin in the treatment of syphilis and there are even
some who desist from the use of arsenic compounds of any kind, no syphil­ographer
of standing countenances the routine treatment of syphilis with a fixed
combination of mercuric iodid and potassium iodid. The use of Pil. Mixed
Treatment (Chichester) is on a par with the use of certain “blood purifiers”
which were advocated at a time when the treatment of syphilis was a baffling
problem.</p>


<h5>PRESENT DAY CLAIMS</h5>

<p>The present advertising, which reads as if it had been written in the heyday
of proprietary license, is, in effect, an invitation to treat syphilis in its various
stages and manifestations with Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester). If heeded
by those who read the advertising of the Hillside Chemical Co., it will result
in much harm to the public and the profession. For this reason, the present
report of the Council is published as a protest against any advertising propaganda
advocating the routine treatment of a disease which requires that each
case be studied carefully so that prompt and efficient measures may be applied
to the various manifestations of the disease.</p>

<p>The following advertisement appeared recently in several medical journals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Medicine is an Exact Science&mdash;on Paper Only!” Every general practitioner of medicine
is called upon to treat Syphilis occasionally. He cannot depend upon the use of arsenicals
alone. In most cases, “mixed treatment” the giving of mercury and iodides is required
to get satisfactory results. <span class="smcap">Pil. Mixed Treatment</span> (<span class="smcap">Chichester</span>) accurately and successfully
meets the indications and assures definite action. Important advantages:</p>

<p>Ready solubility of mercury in combination with Potassium Iodide.</p>

<p>Avoidance of gastric, buccal or intestinal disturbance.</p>

<p>Easy administration, can be taken at any time, anywhere.</p>

<p>Economical, both drugs in one combination.</p>

<p>Accurate adjustment of dosage to each individual case.</p>

<p>Full physiological action&mdash;assured by purity of content.</p>

<p>Secrecy&mdash;patient or friends do not know nature of medicine. Pil Mixed Treatment (Chichester)
has been time tested and trial proven. It needs no introduction to the thousands of
physicians who prescribe or dispense it.</p></div>

<p>While the advertisement does not directly so advise, yet it is a subtle invitation
to the general practitioner to use Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester) and
thus save himself and his patient the time and inconvenience which the rational
treatment of syphilis imposes. A circular “The Treatment of Syphilis Simplified
and Improved” begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No therapeutic fact is more conspicuously and decisively established than that a radical
cure of syphilis can be effected by the continuous administration, from the period of development,
of a proper combination of mercury with iodine.”</p></div>

<p>Continuing, it is admitted that mercury is the most efficacious drug in
the primary and secondary stages of syphilis and iodin in the tertiary stage,
but it is asserted that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it is now granted by all syphil­ologists that the antiluetic action of these drugs
is immeasurably augmented by properly combining them, and that the best results are obtained
when they are conjunctively administered throughout the entire course of the disease.”</p></div>

<p>Arguing along the same lines, this circular continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it was not until mercury and iodine in the form of Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester)
was evolved that the marked advantages of the combined employment of these drugs
in the various stages of syphilis became a scientific certainty.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="312"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a></span></p>
<p>Further we are asked to believe that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Because of the greatly increased potency of mercury and iodine when combined, as in
Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester), the foremost syphil­ologists are now agreed that the
employment of these drugs in such form should be enjoined as soon as the disease develops,
and should be thus continued until a cure has been effected; in other words, Pil. Mixed Treatment
(Chichester) should be made the sole anti­syphilitic medication throughout all stages of the
disease.”</p></div>

<p>The circular illustrates the extent to which our knowledge of drugs may be
distorted and misrepresented and the public health jeopardized in the exploitation
of a proprietary medicine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/312.jpg" width="510" height="372" alt="" />
<div>One reason scientific medicine lags. Uncritical medical journals perpetuate&mdash;for a price&mdash;the
use of nostrums.</div>
</div>


<h5>PROPRIETARY CLAIMS</h5>

<p>In its advertising, the Hillside Chemical Co. claims that Pil. Mixed Treatment
(Chichester) both as to formula and method of preparation “in the incapsulated
powder form” was “brought to the notice of the profession by Dr. W.&nbsp;R.
Chichester of New York, an eminent Syphil­ographer and recognized authority
in the therapeutics of Syphilis.” It is claimed that this pill “is perfectly
soluble, tasteless, nonirritant, and therefore well adapted to a sensitive stomach.”
It is claimed that the pill “is always preferable to one ex­tem­por­aneously prepared,
which, even if identical in composition, often gives negative results.”</p>

<p>An examination made in the chemical laboratory of the association to
determine if the product now marketed contains the claimed amount of potassium
iodid indicated that this was the case. The chemist who made this examination
commented as follows on the claim that in this pill, potassium iodid is rendered
tasteless, that the pill is “perfectly soluble” and that ex­tem­por­aneous pills
of “identical  <span class="ell">..</span>. composition often give negative results.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="313"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a></span></p>
<p>“That the potassium iodid has been rendered tasteless is false, naturally;
the pills when placed in the mouth, after removal of the coating, have the characteristic
taste of alkali iodids. The claim that the pills are entirely soluble is
incorrect; they contain a large amount of insoluble material, probably kaolin.
The assertion that an ex­tem­por­aneous compound prescription even if identical
in composition with the Chichester pill is often inert, is absurd and a reprehensible
attack by suggestion of the ideal that the physician shall write his
prescription to meet the individual needs of his patient and that the pharmacist
shall compound the prescriptions of the physician as they are required. It
should also be pointed out that while much is said about the potassium iodid
in the Chichester pill being in powdered form, the pill mass is solid and very
slowly soluble and the claim of being in powdered form is, if immaterial, also
incorrect.”</p>

<p>As to the asserted standing of the alleged discoverer of the formula for
Pil. Mixed Treatment: Dr. William R. Chichester appears to have lived and
practiced in New York since 1886 or longer, but the claim that he is an “eminent
syphil­ographer” seems to have originated with the exploiters of “Pil.
Mixed Treatment.” Search failed to show the name of W.&nbsp;R. Chichester
among authors of textbooks of syphilis or any other branch of medicine or
among authors of contemporary literature in the <i>Index Medicus</i> from 1907 down
to the present; nor did a search of the catalogue to the Surgeon-General’s
Library reveal W.&nbsp;R. Chichester as ever having published anything on syphilis
or any other subject.</p>

<p>Pil. Mixed Treatment (Chichester) is sold under therapeutic claims which
are unwarranted and misleading. The preparation well illustrates the abuses
which are connected with the exploitation as proprietaries of established drugs
or mixtures of established drugs.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 22, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>ATOPHAN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report explaining
why Atophan has been omitted from New and Non­official Remedies. Schering
and Glatz, Inc., the firm which markets this brand of cinchophen in the United
States, has refused to place either the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeial name, “Phenyl­cinchoninic
Acid (Acidum Phenyl­cinchon­inicum)” or the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. name,
“Cinchophen,” on the label and in the advertising matter so as to make the identity
of the product clear to physicians. Furthermore, the product is sold under therapeutic
claims which the Council holds to be exaggerated and unwarranted.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h5>COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF CINCHOPHEN</h5>

<p>The substance, 2-phenyl-quinolin-4-carboxylic acid, was described by
Doebner and Gieseke in 1887 (<i>Ann. d. Chem.</i> [Liebig’s] <b>242</b>:291). The therapeutic
properties of this compound were described by Nicolaier and Dohrn in
1908 (<i>Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med.</i> <b>93</b>:331). Subsequently the product was
placed on the market and extensively advertised by the Chemische Fabrik auf
Actien (vorm. E. Schering), Berlin, Germany. This firm also took out a patent
in the United States on its production and in 1911 secured a U.&nbsp;S. trademark
on the name “Atophan.” In 1912 Atophan was passed on by the Council and
admitted to New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>When the government of the United States took charge of German-owned
patents during the World War, the Federal Trade Commission, and later the
<span class="pagenum" title="314"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a></span>Chemical Foundation, Inc., issued licenses to American firms whereby these
were authorized to manufacture the compound. In the meantime, Schering
and Glatz, Inc., who had been the U.&nbsp;S. representatives for the Chemische
Fabrik auf Actien, also undertook to supply the drug, but did not obtain a
license from the boards in charge of German patents. Also, this firm secured,
in 1919, a trademark of the word “Atophan,” apparently after the German-owned
trademark had been canceled.</p>

<p>The drug “Atophan” was admitted to the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia as “Phenyl­cinchoninic
Acid (Acidum Phenyl­cinchon­inicum).” As this name proved too
cumbersome, the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry coined the abbreviated
name “Cinchophen” for it, and this name is now used by all the firms which
are marketing the product in the United States, with the exception of Schering
and Glatz, Inc., who use the term “Atophan,” first owned by the Chemische
Fabrik auf Actien.</p>


<h5>ATOPHAN, A BRAND OF CINCHOPHEN</h5>

<p>Because of the confusion which is bound to arise from giving various names
to one drug, the Council selects a common name and provides standards of
identity, purity and strength for any drug which, by reason of the absence or
lapse of patent rights or for other reason, is open to manufacture by more
than one firm. The Council, then, will accept such article only if it is marketed
under the title adopted for New and Non­official Remedies. The rules provide,
however, that when the Council adopts a common name for an article that has
been admitted under another name, such article will be retained in New and
Non­official Remedies under the older name if the Council name is given prominence
on the label and in the circulars and advertisements, in order to avoid
confusion. Accordingly, when the period of acceptance for Atophan in New
and Non­official Remedies was about to expire, Schering and Glatz were notified
that Atophan could be retained in that publication only on condition that the
name, “Cinchophen,” or else the pharmacopeial name, “Phenyl­cinchoninic Acid
(Acidum Phenyl­cinchon­inicum)” be placed on the label and used in the circulars
and advertising.</p>


<h5>UNWARRANTED THERAPEUTIC CLAIMS FOR ATOPHAN</h5>

<p>At the time that the Council asked Schering and Glatz to adopt cinchophen
or phenyl­cinchoninic acid as a synonym for Atophan, the firm was also
requested to omit from future advertising a number of therapeutic claims to
which the Council was obliged to take exception. Schering and Glatz refused
the first request and made no definite promise with regard to the second. The
Council, therefore, directed the omission of Atophan from New and Non­official
Remedies, 1921.</p>

<p>The advertising to which the Council took exception does not appear to be
distributed at present. A pamphlet has been sent out, however, which is equally
objectionable. It contains unwarranted therapeutic claims and suggests that
Atophan be used in conditions in which it is not indicated. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No longer the vague, hypothetical, ‘test-tube demonstrated’ principle of uric acid elimination
by solution, but a definite, scientifically and clinically established, physiologic stimulation
of the uric acid excretion. Performed innocuously and controllable to a nicety by dosage and
by urine and blood tests.”</p></div>

<p>The “innocuousness” of Atophan has not been proved; on the other hand
there is evidence that it is not innocuous, as the recent investigations of Hanzlik
and Scott and their collaborators (Cinchophen, Neocinchophen and Novaspirin
in Rheumatic Fever, J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. <b>76</b>:1728 [June 18] 1921) show that it may
injure the kidney.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="315"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a></span></p>
<p>The circular also contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No longer, hit and miss relief of pain at the expense of the heart, the intestines, the
kidneys and the nervous system, but the promptest and most reliable analgesic, anti-inflammatory
and decongestive action so far known, with notable freedom from heart depressant,
renal irritant, constipating and cumulative toxic by-effects. No contraindications,
except chronic nephritis and the presence of kidney concretions.”</p></div>

<p>This is misleading. The drug depresses the circulation, injures the kidney
and produces symptoms of salicylism or “toxicity.” It is <i>not</i> the promptest and
most reliable analgesic; morphin is superior and salicylate is just as efficient.
The phrase “decongestive action” is vague. Treatment of pulmonary congestion
from phosgene, and congestion of the conjunctiva in mustard oil chemosis of
cats, with large doses of Atophan was ineffective; in fact, it proved distinctly
harmful. This was shown by such workers as Laqueur and Magnus, and
Heubner and Gildemeister (<i>Ztschr. f. d. ges. exper. Med.</i> <b>13</b>:200, 1921). It is
incorrect to ascribe “decongestive” or “anticongestive” action in the true sense
to Atophan (cinchophen). The principal assets of the salicylate-cinchophen
class of drugs in the treatment of rheumatism and gout are their analgesic and
antipyretic qualities.</p>

<p>The claim is made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In Rheumatic and Gouty Disorders, whether of the well-known muscular and arthritic
type, or their Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat manifestations.”</p></div>

<p>The suggestion that Atophan is indicated in “their Eye, Ear, Nose and
Throat manifestations” is a vague generalization without definite meaning, but
nevertheless calculated to impress physicians and promote the sale of Atophan
for common and minor ailments. Rhinitis and sore throat are, of course, self-limited
conditions which require chiefly good habits, personal and general
hygiene as prophylactic measures, and simple hot baths with rest, instead of
medication, for symptomatic relief. When it comes to ear and eye conditions,
Atophan certainly would do no good in otitis media, panophthalmitis, choroiditis,
retinitis, etc.</p>

<p>The administration of Atophan is proposed “in Migrains, Hemicrania, Eyestrain,
etc., often vaguely grouped as ‘Headaches.’&#8239;” Eyestrain and headaches
are vague symptoms often arising from numerous causes that require no medication,
but rather good habits, hygiene and similar corrective measures. There
is always the possibility of habituation from the use of drugs for such common
and vague symptoms, resulting eventually in more harm than good to the patient.</p>

<p>The use of Atophan is proposed “In Influenza (Grippe) for the ready
alleviation of the respiratory congestion, pain and stiffness of limbs and back.”
Probably the entire claim is without warrant, since influenza is a self-limited
disease. Atophan might relieve pain in the joints, reduce the fever, etc., but
at the same time it would tend to impair the functional efficiency of the heart,
which may be impaired already by the disease. Cardiac failure is one of the
causes of death in influenza. The recommendation for “alleviating respiratory
congestion” is certainly without warrant, since in actual trial in pulmonary
congestion by Magnus et al., Atophan was found to be deleterious and not
beneficial. Phosgenized cats are probably as good a test object for the alleged
decongestive action of Atophan as anything could be, since, according to
Underhill and Ringer (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. <b>75</b>:1531, 1920) the pathological physiology
of the circulation and respiration in phosgene poisoning and influenza are
nearly identical.</p>

<p>Further, Atophan is recommended “In Pyorrhea Alveolaris as a systemic
support to local and specific measures.” Atophan is not indicated here. Pyorrhea
requires local medication, if anything at all. It could exert no local
<span class="pagenum" title="316"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a></span>beneficial effects in this condition; indeed, the employment of Atophan might
lead to irritation. Good dental treatment is more essential than medication.</p>

<p>Finally, Schering and Glatz advise Atophan “In Eczema, Pruritus and similar
irritant and itching Skin Diseases with lowered blood alkalinity.” The assumption
that blood alkalinity is lowered in irritant and itching disease is unsupported
by evidence in medical literature and the recommendation is incorrect
and misleading. Neither does Atophan alter the reaction of the blood. Amelioration
in these capricious conditions occurs without medication so that any relief
that might be obtained could not be attributed to Atophan. The entire paragraph
is misleading and will undoubtedly tend to extend the use of Atophan in conditions
for which it is not suited.&mdash;(<i>From Reports of Council on Pharmacy

<h3>UROTROPIN OMITTED FROM N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>Urotropin is a proprietary name applied to the substance which is known
in chemical literature as hexa­methylene­tetramin and which is designated hexa­methylen­amine
in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia. The Council has authorized publication
of the following report explaining that Urotropin was omitted from New
and Non­official Remedies because Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc. (the firm that markets
this brand of hexa­methylen­amin in the United States), refused to place the
U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia name Hexa­methylen­amine (hexa­methylen­amina) on the
label and in its advertising so as to make clear to physicians the identity of the
product, and, furthermore, because it was sold under therapeutic claims which
the Council held unwarranted.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>


<h4>Commercial History of Hexamethylenamin</h4>

<p>This substance which is generally referred to in chemical literature as hexa­methylene­tetramin,
the cyclic condensation product of formaldehyd and
ammonia, appears to have been described first in 1860 (Butlerow: <i>Ann. d. Chem.</i>
<b>115</b>:322, 1860). Subsequently, numerous references to the preparation, properties
and constitution of the substance appeared in chemical literature.</p>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramin is said to have been first used for therapeutic
purposes by G. Bardet, who, in 1894, reported to the Société de Thérapeutique
that he believed this substance to be a uric acid solvent. At about the same
period, A. Nicolaier, who gave Bardet credit for suggesting the use of hexa­methylene­tetramin
as a uric acid solvent, announced the discovery of its antiseptic
action (<i>Centralbl. f. d. med. Wissensch.</i> <b>32</b>:897, 1894; <i>Deutsche med.
Wchnschr.</i> <b>21</b>:541, 1895). Shortly thereafter as a result of Nicolaier’s publication,
the Chemische Fabrik auf Aktien vorm. E. Schering, Berlin, Germany,
began to offer the product to the medical profession under the trademarked
and nondescriptive name “Urotropine.” In the United States, it was marketed
by Schering and Glatz, who then were acting as American agents for the
Schering works of Germany.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that hexa­methylene­tetramin was a valuable drug.
As the substance was introduced at a time when new “synthetic” drugs were
rapidly appearing and when unlimited and uncritical confidence was placed in
them, and before the medical profession became skeptical of the claims advanced
by manufacturers for their respective “discoveries,” it was not long before
this new drug was placed on the market by many firms, each applying its own
name and often keeping the chemical character of it in the background. Some
of the names which were thus applied to hexa­methylen­amin were Cystogen,
Aminoform, Formin, Uritone, Urisol, {and} Cystamine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="317"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a></span></p>
<p>In 1907 the late Prof. J.&nbsp;O. Schlotterbeck, then a member of the Council,
protested against the confusion caused by the marketing of a given drug under
different names. He stated that it was not uncommon for a physician to prescribe
two or more of these identical substances in the same mixture, expecting
to get the combined action of different urinary antiseptics; also, that patients
had been treated first with hexa­methylen­amin under one name and later by the
same substance under another name (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Jan. 19, 1907, p.&nbsp;241).</p>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramin was admitted to the eighth revision of the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia. In part because of this official recognition and standard­ization
and in part because the extravagant reports of its virtues had been largely discounted,
physicians have in general prescribed the drug by its pharmacopeial
name, with one notable exception: Urotropin. One reason for this is that
Urotropin was the first proprietary brand of hexa­methylene­tetramin introduced,
a second reason is that through the extensive and persistent advertising of the
proprietary name under which the substance was introduced, it has become
firmly fixed in the minds of many physicians. The other is that the product
was claimed to be of greater purity than the product sold under the pharmacopeial
or other name although no evidence confirmatory of this claim has
ever been published. On the other hand, Daniel Base, as long ago as 1907,
found that hexa­methylen­amin sold under its pharmacopeial name is just as
pure as when sold under proprietary names. When, in 1907, urotropin was
admitted to New and Non­official Remedies, the published description showed
that it was manufactured by the Chemische Fabrik auf Aktien vorm. E. Schering,
Berlin, and that Schering and Glatz were the United States agents. In 1919,
the description was revised to show that Schering and Glatz were no longer
selling the German product.</p>

<p>As it is the general practice to omit articles that are admitted to the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia for the reason that their quality is guaranteed under the federal
Food and Drugs Act and because pharmacopeial nonproprietary articles are
rarely advertised with claims that require the Council’s control, yet, in the
case of Urotropin, it was retained because it was sold under a name not
recognized in the pharmacopeia and because special (proprietary) claims were
made for it.</p>


<h4>Urotropin Marketed Under Unwarranted Therapeutic Claims</h4>

<p>The period for which Urotropin stood “Accepted” expired with the close of
1921. To determine its continued eligibility for New and Non­official Remedies,
the Council examined the labels and circular matter sent by Schering and
Glatz for the purpose and also a booklet “Urotropin,” subsequently sent by the
firm to physicians.</p>

<p>It was found that the pamphlet contained a number of unwarranted statements.
Particularly objectionable are the claims made for the use of Urotropin
as an antiseptic in body fluids that are alkaline, such as the cerebrospinal fluid,
bile, aqueous humor of the eye, saliva, the excretions caused by middle ear
infection and other excretions of the nasal, bronchial, laryngeal and mucous
membranes. The lack of efficacy of hexa­methylen­amin in alkaline secretions
is generally admitted and the clinical references to the use of hexa­methylen­amin
in the pamphlet are obsolete. In the introduction to the pamphlet,
Schering and Glatz state that they are well acquainted with the scientific
research work discrediting the efficiency of hexa­methylen­amin in nonacid
mediums, but that they feel that the accumulated evidence for its efficacy in
such conditions should not be “brushed aside.” However, the pamphlet is not
made up of quotations, but of unqualified statements. With one exception, all
references to the antiseptic properties of the drug in alkaline mediums are
previous to 1913, that is, before the importance of reaction of the medium was
<span class="pagenum" title="318"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a></span>fully appreciated. To quote these earlier articles without regard to the later
work, which in most eyes discredited them, constitutes in effect an exploitation of
this brand of hexa­methylen­amin under unwarranted therapeutic claims.</p>


<h4>Urotropin a Brand of Hexamethylenamine, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.</h4>

<p>In consideration of the confusion which arises from the application of
different names to an identical article, the rules of the Council provide that
when an article which has been accepted for New and Non­official Remedies is
admitted to the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia under another name, it will be retained,
provided the official name is given prominence on the label and in the advertising
of such article. Neither the label nor the advertising for Urotropin gives
prominence to the pharmacopeial name as a synonym nor indeed does it bring
out the fact that Urotropin is a brand of hexa­methylen­amine, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. Schering
and Glatz, Inc., was advised that Urotropin could be retained in New and Non­official
Remedies only on condition that the objections to the therapeutic
recommendations were removed and on agreement that the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. name
appear on the labels and circular matter. The firm did not offer to make the
product eligible for continued recognition; accordingly the Council directed
the omission of Urotropin because of conflict with Rule 6 (Unwarranted Therapeutic
Claims) and with Rule 8 (Objectionable Names).&mdash;(<i>From Reports of
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1921, p 71.</i>)</p>

<h3>STYPTYSATE NOT ADMITTED TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report, declaring
Styptysate (Ernst Hischoff Co., Inc.) inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>Styptysate, according to the advertisement of Ernst Bischoff Co., Inc., New
York, is “obtained by dialysis from Bursa Pastoris (Sheppard’s [<i>sic!</i>] Purse).”
It is claimed to be “The Remedy For Hemorrhages,” to be “Superior to Ergot
and Hydrastis,” “of particular advantage in Menorrhagia and Metrorrhagia”
and to have been “found of great value in vesical hemorrhages and hemorrhages
from mucous membranes in general.” The Styptysate label bears the
synonym “Dialysate Herba Bursa Pastoris”; the statement that it contains
“alcohol 11 per cent.” and that it is “made in Germany.” No other statement
of the composition or strength of “Styptysate” is furnished nor is the name of
the German manufacturer disclosed.</p>

<p>In an advertising circular entitled “Styptysate, a New Reliable Hemostatic,” it
is declared that in recent years the plant, Shepherd’s Purse (<i>Capsella bursa
pastoris</i>), “has been submitted to clinical tests in the form of a concentrated
dialysate, known as Styptysate, by Loewy, Oppenheim, Krummacher and others,
and that their reports coincide in regard to Styptysate as a hemostatic <i>par
excellence</i>, particularly in uterine hemorrhages, even in cases where ergot and
hydrastis had failed to produce satisfactory results.” The circular also reprints
some “short clinical reports” without reference to their authorship; one ascribed
to Krummacher and two ascribed to “B.H.M., Kansas City, Mo.,” and the
following references: “A. Krummacher, M.D., <i>Monthly Review for Obstetrics
and Gynecology</i>, Berlin, Vol. XLIX, 4, and Vol. LII.” “H. Oppenheim, M.D.,
<i>Medical Clinic</i>, Berlin, 1920, 35.”</p>

<p>Shepherd’s Purse is a weed common in the United States and in Europe.
Like most other herbs, it has some reputation as a folk medicine. It is used by
eclectics and homeopaths, being included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of
the United States. Shepherd’s Purse receives no consideration at the hands of
the authors of standard works on materia medica, pharmacology or therapeutics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="319"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a></span></p>
<p>From an examination of recent German medical publications, it appears that
the use of Shepherd’s Purse was proposed as a substitute for ergot and hydrastis,
when the latter drugs became scarce in Germany. These publications, in the
main, emanate from those in the employ of pharmaceutical firms and deal with
proprietary preparations or they are written by physicians who used these
proprietary preparations at the solicitation of the manufacturers. For this
reason the reported results must be accepted with reserve.</p>

<p>One of the proprietary preparations discussed in the German publications is
Styptysate, manufactured by Isalfabrik Johannes Buerger, Wernigerode. It is
said to be produced by submitting the juice of fresh Shepherd’s Purse to
dialysis and preserving the dialysate by the addition of alcohol. There is no
statement as to the drug strength or the chemical or biological standards, if
any, used in its manufacture; hence, the preparation is essentially a secret one.
As first produced, the preparation seems to have been fortified by the addition
of cotarnin: the dose was then given as ten to fifteen drops. Later, as the cost
of cotarnin went up, this drug was omitted, and the drug strength increased;
the dose of the new preparation is given as twenty-five to thirty drops. Just
what relation, if any, the Styptysate of Ernst Bischoff Co., Inc., bears to that
of the Isalfabrik Johannes Buerger, Wernigerode, cannot be determined from
the Bischoff advertising. If it has any relationship the announcement that no
narcotic order is required when ordering Styptysate would indicate that the
new preparation is supplied; the old one with its addition of cotarnin would
require a narcotic order. On the other hand, the recommended dose of the
cotarnin-free preparation is twenty-five to thirty-drops, whereas the product
sold by Bischoff and Co. is to be given in doses of ten to fifteen drops&mdash;that is,
in the amount proposed for the cotarnin-fortified product.</p>

<p>What justification is there for the claim that Styptysate has been submitted
to clinical tests by Loewy, Oppenheim and Krummacher and found to be a
hemostatic <i>par excellence</i> and efficient even where ergot had failed to give
satisfactory results? Loewy (<i>Zentralblatt für Gynäcologie</i> <b>42</b>:920, 1921) made
some pharmacologic tests on guinea-pigs with the cotarnin-containing preparation,
but reported no clinical trials. Hans Oppenheim (<i>Medizinische Klinik</i>,
Aug. 29, 1920, p.&nbsp;906) reported that he was agreeably surprised at the excellent
results (<i>vorzueglichem Erfolg</i>) obtained with the drug but he did not assert
that it is superior to ergot.</p>

<p>Krummacher reported on thirteen cases of profuse menstruation in which
the patients were treated with Styptysate, using for a part, the preparation
containing cotarnin and for the other a preparation without cotarnin. He
reported as good results with the cotarnin-free preparation in larger dosage, as
with the cotarnin-containing preparation in smaller dosage. Krummacher did
not compare Styptysate with ergot. Some of Krummacher’s cases are quoted,
with some typographical errors, in the Bischoff circular.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the product discussed in German publications is the
Styptysate marketed in the United States, the best that can be said for it is,
that during a shortage of ergot it was used in place of that established drug.
There is no evidence to warrant the use of this indefinite proprietary in place
of the biologically standardized fluidextract of ergot or other standardized ergot
preparations.</p>

<p>Styptysate (Ernst Bischoff and Co., Inc.) is inadmissible to New and Non­official
Remedies because its composition is semisecret and indefinite and there
is no evidence that its uniformity and strength is controlled (Rules 1 and 2);
further, it is inadmissible because the therapeutic claims advanced for it are
exaggerated and unwarranted (Rule 6) and because there is no evidence that it
possesses any advantage over established drugs such as the biologically standardized
fluidextract of ergot or the definite ergot preparations admitted to New
and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 11, 1922.</i>)</p>

<h3>LIPOIDAL SUBSTANCES (HOROVITZ) NOT ADMITTED
TO N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R.</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has authorized publication of the following report declaring
Lipoidal Substances (Horovitz) inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies
because its composition is essentially secret and because the curative claims
made for it are unsubstantiated and, therefore, unwarranted.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>In the advertising of the Horovitz Biochemic Laboratories Co. (A.&nbsp;S.
Horovitz, president) we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Horovitz proves by careful paralleled investigations of normal and of pathological
tissues, both in addiction disease and in other diseases, that in patients suffering from narcotic
addiction disease there is an inactivity of the lymph-glands due to the use of the
drug and that the system is not supplied with the necessary fats.” “Horovitz further found
that the lipoidal content of the cerebro-spinal system varies in strict accordance with the
pathological processes introduced by infection or by alkaloids. Furthermore, he has found
that the lipoids of various other organs, as well as those of the nervous system, may be
extracted and consumed by the administration of narcotic alkaloids.”</p></div>

<p>It is further stated in the advertising that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After a long and very careful research investigation, Dr. Horovitz worked out a method
of rational treatment for narcotic addiction disease which involves the restoration of the
lipoids, which have been lost through the action of the drug, and of the toxins, by means
of a combination of lipoidal substance from various plant lipoids in the form of a sterile solution.
This preparation not only replaces the lipoids lost by the tissues, but also protects the
nerve tissues, from attacks by the toxins elaborated during the use of narcotics, and, this by
detoxicating the tissues, brings about permanent freedom from the craving of narcotics,
instead of the temporary relief afforded by other methods of treatment.”</p></div>

<p>The “combination of lipoidal substance of various plant lipoids” which was
worked out by Horovitz, the Horovitz Biochemic Laboratories offer as “Lipoidal
Substances.” This preparation is supplied in ampoules said to contain 1&nbsp;c.c. of
solution. The treatment with “Lipoidal Substances” consists, first, in the complete
withdrawal of the narcotic; second, in free catharsis; and third, in the
intramuscular injection of the preparation. The initial dose is given as 8 to 12
minims repeated with increase of 3 to 4 minims every three hours during the
first day. On the second, third and fourth day 16 minims is to be given twice
a day and “from the fifth day until the medication is stopped (usually 28 to 35
days) it will be necessary usually to give but 1 injection of 16 minims each
day.”</p>

<p>In a request for the admission of its preparation to New and Non­official
Remedies, the Horovitz Biochemic Laboratories Co. stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The composition of Lipoidal Substance is (<i>a</i>) Lipoids of plant origin, (<i>b</i>) Vitamines
(water soluble) of plant origin, (<i>c</i>) Non-specific plant proteins, (<i>d</i>) Preservatives&mdash;None.”</p></div>

<p>While the communication abounded in generalities, it gave neither the
identity nor character of the lipoids, of the vitamins nor of the nonspecific
protein, nor their quantities or methods for their control. The firm presented
no evidence that the injection of “Lipoidal Substances” produced any effect
other than by suggestion. Also, while a long list of references to publications
bearing on lipoids was submitted (many of which had no bearing on the subject
under consideration) there was no reference to the work of Horovitz quoted
in the firm’s advertising.</p>

<p>After examining the information which had been submitted, the Council
requested the manufacturer to supply:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="321"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a></span></p>
<p>1. Information as to the character (identity) of the several ingredients
contained in the preparation that it marketed, the amount of each ingredient so
far as known and the method used for their control.</p>

<p>2. Evidence that the administration of “Lipoidal Substances” is of value in
the treatment of drug addiction.</p>

<p>3. Evidence for the claims that the “researches” of Horovitz have proved
that “in patients suffering from narcotic addiction disease there is an inactivity
of the lymph-glands <span class="ell">..</span>. and the system is not supplied with the necessary
fats” and that “lipoidal content of the cerebro-spinal system varies in strict
accordance with the pathological processes introduced by infection or by
alkaloids” and that “the lipoids of various other organs as well as those of the
nervous system, may be extracted and consumed by the administration of narcotic
alkaloids.”</p>

<p>The Horovitz Biochemic Laboratories replied that the requested information
would be supplied in about <i>two weeks</i>. At the expiration of <i>three months</i> the
promised information and evidence had not been received; neither had any
reports to show the value of the treatment come to the attention of the Council.
The Council, accordingly, declared “Lipoidal Substances” (Horovitz Biochemic
Laboratories) inadmissible to New and Non­official Remedies because the composition
is essentially secret and because the curative claims are unsubstantiated
and unwarranted.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 25, 1922.</i>)</p>

<h3>YEAST PREPARATIONS AND VITAMIN B CONCENTRATES</h3>

<h4>Report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry</h4>


<p>The Council has adopted the following principles as a guide in the consideration
of yeast preparations and vitamin B concentrates for New and Non­official
Remedies.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. A. Puckner</span>, Secretary.</p>

<p>1. The claim that deficiency of vitamin B and diseases resulting therefrom
are common conditions in the United States is not at this time supported by
adequate acceptable evidence.</p>

<p>2. The claim that yeast preparations or extracts are, in principle or in
general, essentially more effective or more practical or more available means
of administering vitamins than the commonly available vitamin-containing foods
is not at this time supported by adequate acceptable evidence. (Any claims
for superiority made for such products proposed for inclusion in New and Non­official
Remedies must be presented in detail and passed on specially by the
Council.)</p>

<p>3. The claim that therapy with yeast or yeast preparations has as yet more
than an experimental status is not at this time supported by adequate acceptable
evidence.</p>

<p>Preparations for which such claims are made, directly or by implication or
in one-sided quotations, in advertisements or letters or by salesmen, cannot be
admitted to or retained in New and Non­official Remedies.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 15, 1922.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY OF THE AMERICAN
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION</h3>

<hr class="r16" />

<p>The Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association
was established in 1906 to assist the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
in the investigation of proprietary remedies.</p>

<p>In accordance with the principle of its foundation, the Laboratory
examines and checks the claims made for the composition and chemical
properties of the products under examination by the Council, and when
these are admitted to New and Non­official Remedies, it insures the
establishment of tests and standards whereby the identity and purity
of these products may be controlled. In addition, the Laboratory supplies
information, secured by reference to chemical and pharmaceutical
literature or by actual analytic work, in regard to proprietary and
unofficial medicines, either for publication in <i>The Journal of the American
Medical Association</i> or through direct correspondence.</p>

<p>Those portions of the Laboratory’s activities which are of special
interest to physicians and which were not included in the Reports of
the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry were included in the Propaganda
for Reform in Proprietary Medicines, ninth edition (1916), so
far as they had been published up to the time when the edition was
issued; those made during the last five years are included in Part II
of this volume.</p>

<p>For a detailed report of the Laboratory’s work, the reader is
referred to the article that follows on “The Work of the American
Medical Association Chemical Laboratory.” Those who are interested
in the analysis of drugs are referred to the Reports of the Chemical
Laboratory issued annually for the details of the analyses which have
been made by the Laboratory.</p>

<h3>THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
CHEMICAL LABORATORY<a name="FNanchor_G_153" id="FNanchor_G_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_153" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></h3>

<p class="author">W. A. Puckner, Phar.D.</p>


<p>The American Medical Association Chemical Laboratory was established
nearly ten years ago&mdash;in fall of 1906. The reason for its existence was primarily
the fact that the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry found it difficult
to secure from outside sources such help as it needed in checking up the
<span class="pagenum" title="323"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a></span>composition and properties of proprietary medicines under investigation. Medical
schools and similar institutions were found ready to lend their assistance
in pharmacologic and medical investigations; but the chemical investigation
required the establishment of a laboratory under the control of the American
Medical Association.</p>

<p>As years have passed, the scope of the laboratory has been extended: Its
services have been requisitioned by <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> in various ways. Thus, when
requested, the laboratory reviews and verifies the chemical data contained in
editorials and original contributions. The laboratory is often called on for
information as to the character and composition of quack treatments and
so-called “patent medicines.” Through the columns of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> and
through direct correspondence, the laboratory responds to requests of physicians
with information regarding the composition of medicines which they prescribe
or in which they are interested. The laboratory attempts to be to the members
of the American Medical Association what the prescription pharmacist is, or
should be, to the prescribing physician&mdash;a storehouse of chemical and pharmaceutical
information. In the belief that an insufficient familiarity with the chemistry
and pharmacy of drugs constitutes the chief reason for the extensive use of
unscientific, worthless or fraudulent proprietary remedies, this service is
rendered by the laboratory as a contribution to the cause of rational therapy.</p>

<p>Since the efficiency of the American Medical Association Chemical Laboratory
will increase as its activities are better known, the following more detailed
statement of its work is offered:</p>


<h5>THE LABORATORY AND THE COUNCIL</h5>

<p>As stated in the rules of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, it is
“manifestly impossible for the Council to investigate the composition of every
complex pharmaceutical mixture&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”; “it can only give an unbiased
judgment on the available evidence.” In line with this, the laboratory does
not undertake to prove the composition of constitution of all new synthetics, nor
does it attempt to determine the individual composition of proprietary mixtures.
It checks all claims that seem doubtful, however, and uses its best endeavors to
secure correction of misstatements with regard to proprietary remedies and
improvement in the quality of these products. Further, it reexamines, when this
seems desirable, the products which have been admitted by the Council to New
and Non­official Remedies, and thus determines, from time to time, their dependability.
The fact that no product admitted to New and Non­official Remedies
has later been shown to be untrue to its claimed composition is, it is believed,
an indication that in this respect the laboratory has succeeded in performing
the work for which it was primarily created.</p>

<p>In this connection the question may be asked, Are many proprietary medicines
exploited to the medical profession with false claims in regard to their
composition? Also it may be asked, Has the number of proprietaries marketed
with false statements of composition decreased since the Council and the laboratory
began their work? Answering the latter question first: There is no doubt
that today fewer proprietary medicines are being sold with false claims as to composition
than there were ten years ago. When the Council began its work, medical
journal advertising teemed with statements regarding the composition of medicines
which any chemist familiar with medicine would not hesitate at sight to
brand as untrue. Today such manifestly false claims are rare. Coming to the
former question: Many false statements regarding the identity and composition
of remedies have been made in ignorance. This is not surprising when it is
remembered that the most ignorant may and do engage in the manufacture of
medicine. Besides ignorance, however, an accommodating conscience on the
part of the manufacturer and a failure on the part of the medical profession to
appreciate the danger which lies in the use of medicines of unknown composition
<span class="pagenum" title="324"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a></span>unquestionably have greatly encouraged the marketing of falsely declared
medicines. A glaring illustration of the ignorance of manufacturers&mdash;for it is
hard to believe that any business concern would deliberately court prosecution
by the federal authorities through false statements on labels&mdash;is the fact that nearly
thirty years ago A.&nbsp;B. Lyons published a <span class="nowrap">report<a name="FNanchor_147_154" id="FNanchor_147_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_154" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> pointing out that the proprietary
Iodia was falsely declared as to composition and that in 1914 when the Council
examined this preparation such incorrect declaration appeared on the label<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_148_155" id="FNanchor_148_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_155" class="fnanchor">148</a></span>
That many physicians do not recognize the danger to their patients and
their reputation in the use of medicines, the composition of which they do not
know, is illustrated by the fact, disclosed by inquiries sent to the laboratory,
that physicians were found willing to employ an arsenical preparation (Venarsen),
advertised for intravenous use, although its promoters vouchsafed no
information in regard to the nature of the arsenic compound contained therein.</p>


<h5>UNRELIABILITY OF LITTLE USED DRUGS</h5>

<p>The purpose of the federal Food and Drugs Act is to secure the prosecution
and punishment of all who sell medicines which are adulterated or misrepresented
as to composition. As a matter of fact, the wording of the law relating
to the adulteration and misbranding of drugs is such that the federal authorities
have been able to do little more than to require that the drugs for which
standards are provided in the Pharmacopeia shall when sold comply with those
standards. Similarly, those states which attempt to improve the quality of
drugs sold within their borders&mdash;few states do efficient work along these lines&mdash;limit
their work to the enforcement of the Pharmacopeial standards. This
leaves the vast number of unofficial drugs and medicaments beyond the control
of federal or state authorities. While most of these drugs are relatively unimportant,
and while the amounts of them which are used are not great individually,
the total consumption of them is large. With a view of furnishing
to physicians standards for drugs of this sort the Council has described in
New and Non­official Remedies not only distinctly proprietary drugs, but also
some of the unofficial drugs which are apparently of therapeutic value and used
to a considerable extent. Aiding the Council in this line of endeavor, the
laboratory has attempted to establish standards for these little used drugs, and
New and Non­official Remedies, 1916, provides standards for such unofficial
and non-proprietary drugs as quinin and urea hydrochlorid quinin, tannate,
sodium acid phosphate, and sodium perborate. An example of work which
furnished much needed standards for an unofficial article is the investigation
of zinc permanganate by W.&nbsp;S. Hilpert<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_149_156" id="FNanchor_149_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_156" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> Reference to the published reports
of the laboratory will give an idea of the amount of work such standard­ization
entails. A reference to the new U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, when this comes
from the press, will show that a considerable number of unofficial articles
described in New and Non­official Remedies have been admitted to the Pharmacopeia
along with the standards worked out in this laboratory.</p>

<p>While in a way the work done in connection with these less important drugs
has attracted little attention from the medical profession, it has had an effect
on pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the past, pharmaceutical houses, ever
anxious to market something new, on the slightest provocation have placed on
the market, in the form of pills, powder, elixir, ampule, etc., every drug for
which some sort of medical recommendation could be found. In marketing
these dosage forms, the manufacturer has too often been little concerned
about the quality of the drugs used<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_150_157" id="FNanchor_150_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_157" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> Just at present, for instance, some interest
<span class="pagenum" title="325"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></span>is being shown in iron cacodylate; but while manufacturers appear to be most
ready to take advantage of this interest by offering the drug in the form of
ampules, etc., they have given little help toward the establishment of standards
for this arsenic compound. Manufacturers are ever ready to sell drugs of
all sorts, but in view of the small demand they cannot or will not safeguard
the identity and purity of such drugs. A further illustration of the unreliability
of unofficial drugs is the recent report by Levy and <span class="nowrap">Rowntree<a name="FNanchor_151_158" id="FNanchor_151_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_158" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> showing not only
that the various dosage forms of emetin hydrochlorid obtained from different
manufacturers varied from manufacturer to manufacturer, but also that the
product of the same manufacturer was variable and that the supply furnished
by one pharmaceutical firm was so toxic as to make its use dangerous.</p>


<h5>THE ANALYSIS OF “PATENT MEDICINES”</h5>

<p>In the preface to the first annual report of the chemical laboratory it was
stated that the laboratory “occasionally takes up the examination of ‘patent
medicines’&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” At that time it was felt that the widespread use by the
medical profession of irrational and even secret medicines made it necessary
to devote the laboratory’s attention to the correction of this evil. As the years
have passed on, these conditions have been remedied to some extent, at least
so far as chemical analysis can correct them. On the other hand, public opinion
has been aroused to the many evils connected with the exploitation of “patent
medicines,” and has more and more insistently demanded that the medical
profession aid in the correction of this evil. Accordingly, the laboratory has
paid much attention to the analysis of “patent medicines” during the last few
years. As the chief asset of “patent medicines” is the element of secrecy
which surrounds their composition, it is hoped that the laboratory’s analysis of
such widely used “patent medicines” as Nature’s Creation<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_152_159" id="FNanchor_152_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_159" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> Mayr’s Wonderful
Stomach Remedy<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_153_160" id="FNanchor_153_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_160" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> Sanatogen<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_154_161" id="FNanchor_154_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_161" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> Eckman’s Alterative<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_155_162" id="FNanchor_155_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_162" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> Tonsiline<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_156_163" id="FNanchor_156_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_163" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> and Bromo-<span class="nowrap">Quinin<a name="FNanchor_157_164" id="FNanchor_157_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_164" class="fnanchor">157</a></span>
has been worth the labor. In addition, the work of this laboratory
has been published, including not only the results of its analyses, but also the
methods which are used. In view of the dearth of published reports regarding
the methods used in the analysis of “patent medicines,” it is hoped that this
feature of the laboratory’s work has been of aid to chemists engaged in
similar work.</p>

<p>The laboratory’s activities along these lines have done much to discount
the claim of proprietary manufacturers that chemical analysis is unable to
determine the character of “patent medicines.” The recent Wine of Cardui
trial has brought it out prominently that chemical analysis can determine the
presence of potent constituents, and that “patent medicines” which fail to
reveal such potent ingredients to the analyst may safely be put down as worthless.
The demonstration that the essential composition of medicinal preparations
may be determined by chemical analysis should also prove an effective
answer to the manufacturers in their protest against the requirement, now
being urged for enactment into law in various states, that the medicinal ingredients
of their wares must be declared on the label. Manufacturers have held
that this would lay them open to competition with imitations and substitutions.
The possibility of chemical identification proves, however, that secrecy of
composition, though it prevents consumers from knowing the character of a
“patent medicine,” will not be a hindrance to the imitator and substitutor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="326"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></span></p>

<h5>IDENTITY OF DRUGS USED IN INVESTIGATIONS</h5>

<p>In the past, much of the experimental work in medicine has seriously suffered
in that the identity of the material used in such investigations was not
established. In view of this the laboratory has watched the contributions
submitted to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, and whenever necessary and feasible has urged
the authors to identify their material before publication of the findings. For
instance, a number of staining agents&mdash;so-called “anilin dyes”&mdash;have been
found to possess therapeutic action. Since the identity of many of these
staining agents is today essentially secret, the laboratory has urged through
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> that those who experiment with these substances make an effort
to determine their identity whenever possible and to give preference to those
the chemical identity of which is known. The need for such identification has
been discussed in the reports of the laboratory<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_158_165" id="FNanchor_158_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_165" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> The amount of work involved
in the chemical identification of drugs used for experimental work is illustrated
in a contribution entitled “An Examination of Several Commercial Specimens
of Opium Alkaloids or Their Salts.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_159_166" id="FNanchor_159_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_166" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> by L.&nbsp;E. Warren, in which was determined
the identity of the various opium products used in an investigation by
D.&nbsp;I. Macht, carried out under a grant of the Therapeutic Research Committee.</p>


<h5>THE LABORATORY AND PHARMACEUTICAL LITERATURE</h5>

<p>In the past much of the information in regard to the composition and
properties of medicines which has appeared in pharmaceutical journals has
not become available to medicine. In many cases medical journals could not
afford to publish such data because this would have been contrary to the
interest of their advertisers, and hence the publications regarding the irrational
character of Lactopeptine, of Bromidia, etc., which appeared in the pharmaceutical
journals did not become a matter of common medical knowledge.
Through the laboratory an attempt has been made to keep the medical profession
informed in regard to pharmaceutical literature. The laboratory has a good
working pharmaceutical and chemical library, and subscribes to the important
American and foreign pharmaceutical and chemical publications. The discussion
of new remedies, such as medinal and sodium veronal<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_160_167" id="FNanchor_160_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_167" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> salvarsan,
atoxyl and arsacetin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_161_168" id="FNanchor_161_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_168" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> and <span class="nowrap">neosalvarsan<a name="FNanchor_162_169" id="FNanchor_162_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_169" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> soon after their introduction, illustrates
the work of the laboratory along these lines.</p>


<h5>THE LABORATORY’S EFFORTS TOWARD RATIONAL PRESCRIBING</h5>

<p>The laboratory naturally is in thorough sympathy with the present day
efforts toward a more rational use of drugs, as exemplified in the Council’s
publication “Useful Drugs.” Two recent contributions of the laboratory may
be cited as a further support of the movement for limiting prescribing to the
more widely used drugs. In line with the general tendency of manufacturers
to put out all sorts of modifications and asserted improvements over official
substances, there have been placed on the market a number of preparations
said to represent some improvement over the pharmacopeial Blaud pills.
The report, “The Quality of Commercial Blaud’s Pills,<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_163_170" id="FNanchor_163_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_170" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> by L.&nbsp;E. Warren,
shows that the ordinary pharmacopeial Blaud pill is in every way the equal
of the semiproprietary preparations claimed to be improvements. Further,
the examination of the various brands of sodium and theobromin salicylate
<span class="pagenum" title="327"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></span>as compared with the preparation diuretin by P.&nbsp;N. <span class="nowrap">Leech<a name="FNanchor_164_171" id="FNanchor_164_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_171" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> shows that the
former preparations, sold at 35 cents per ounce at the time the examination
was made, are fully the equal of the proprietary Diuretin, which then cost
the druggist $1.75 per ounce.</p>


<h5>THE LABORATORY AS AN INFORMATION BUREAU</h5>

<p>It is generally admitted that the proprietary medicine business, particularly
the exploitation of complex mixtures, attained the extensive vogue which it has
or had because instruction in medical schools was deficient in materia medica,
pharmacy and chemistry. As a result of lack of knowledge along these lines,
the young graduate after some trial became fearful of formulating his own
prescriptions, and in time became dependent on pharmaceutical firms which
provided him with medicines ready to dispense. That physicians have been
insufficiently trained in regard to the pharmacy and chemistry of drugs has often
been emphasized in pharmaceutical journals where prescriptions containing
incompatible drugs are reported and where even plans are brought forward
whereby the pharmaceutical profession may aid in remedying this difficulty.</p>

<p>During my pharmaceutical experience I was often sorely vexed as to what
to do when prescriptions contained drugs which on mixing would undergo
decomposition which the physician surely did not anticipate. I remember well
a prescription directing that potassium permanganate be made into pills with
extract of gentian and other things, and how, the physician having spurned
the suggestion to modify the prescription so as to avoid decomposition of
the permanganate, I was obliged to select a mortar, gently triturate the drugs
until a conflagration was started, and to finish the prescription after the combustion
had subsided. However, in my pharmaceutical experience I generally
found the physician most ready to receive suggestions from the pharmacist
which would prevent incompatibilities, improve the palatability and appearance
of his prescriptions, and protect the patient from unnecessary expense.</p>

<p>Similarly it has been my experience since the establishment of the Association’s
laboratory that physicians are anxious to receive information in regard
to the materia medica, pharmacy and chemistry of drugs. As the druggist
earns the respect and support of the physician when he makes available to
him the pharmaceutical knowledge and experience which he has, so this
laboratory has aimed to gain the endorsement of the American Medical Association
membership by furnishing to physicians information in regard to the
composition, chemistry and pharmacy of drugs through replies in the Query
and Minor Notes Department of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> as well as through direct correspondence.
It has been most gratifying to the laboratory that <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
receives an increasing number of inquiries both as regards the chemical and
pharmaceutical questions involved in the writing of prescriptions and as regards
the composition of secret and semisecret proprietaries (often because they are
prescribed by the inquirer’s colleague) and “patent medicines” (which are
taken by his patient). The laboratory has tried its best to answer the many
inquiries received. Many of the questions which come in can be answered by
a pharmacist or chemist without hesitation. Others, particularly as to the
composition of medicines, the laboratory has been able to answer by reference
to its library and its extensive card index. Still others have required experimentation
and chemical analysis.</p>

<p>While, as stated a moment ago, the laboratory has encouraged the sending
of inquiries and has earnestly striven to furnish the information asked for,
it is obvious that the amount of chemical work which can be done is limited.
The small size of the laboratory force, consisting of three chemists engaged in
actual analytical work, makes it necessary to select for investigation those
<span class="pagenum" title="328"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a></span>problems which shall be of general interest to the medical profession. As
the American Medical Association is national in its scope, the laboratory has
held that it can do analytical work only when such work will be of general
interest to physicians and of value both to the medical profession and the
public. In view of this it has refrained from undertaking analyses which
would benefit only the physician making the inquiry and possibly his patient.
The laboratory further has not felt justified in undertaking work of merely
local interest; instead it has used its endeavors to secure the investigation of
such local problems by municipal or state authorities.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 25, 1916.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>LEAD IN “AKOZ”</h3>

<p>Akoz is a mineral product sold by the Natura Company of San Francisco,
and said to possess most remarkable medicinal properties.</p>

<p>A circular issued by the Natura Company begins thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While scientists have been striving through the centuries to compound remedies for man’s
various ills, Nature, greatest chemist of them all, has been working wonders in her crucibles
and has achieved results far beyond man’s greatest expectation.”</p>

<p>“Nature’s chief handicap has been the difficulty of placing her gifts in the hands of those
whom she would benefit. By accident or fate, as you will, one of Nature’s greatest medicinal
products has just been discovered. It is the mineral given the name of Akoz by John D.
Mackenzie, president and manager of the Natura Company of San Francisco, which is now
giving this rare remedy of Nature to the public.”</p></div>

<p>The circular then describes how the power of the “rare remedy” to cure
rheumatism is claimed to have been discovered and asserts that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Akoz was subjected to every known scientific test before being presented to the public. It
was practically determined that the ore contained a new element having radium-like qualities
but containing nothing poisonous or harmful.”</p>

<p>“After the curative virtues of Akoz for rheumatism, stomach trouble, eczema, catarrh, piles,
ulcers and numerous other ailments had been fully established in chemical laboratory, hospital
clinic, and the private practice of physicians in various parts of the world, Mr. Mackenzie
effected the organization of the Natura Company.”</p></div>

<p>This product, put up in the form of “Akoz Medicinal Mineral Water, Akoz
Ointment, Akoz Powder and Akoz Suppositories,” was submitted to the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry for consideration some years ago with the claims
that “Akoz” itself consists essentially of zinc sulphid, barium sulphate and
aluminum oxid. The submitted analysis did not declare the presence of lead or
of uranium though “special tests” for the latter had been “run.” Without
checking the claimed composition, the Council at that time refused recognition
to Akoz because there was no evidence submitted for the very extravagant and
altogether improbable therapeutic claims.</p>

<p>After the Council had concluded the consideration of Akoz a letter was
received from a California physician stating that according to an analysis submitted
to him Akoz contained 0.34 per cent. of lead in the form of lead
sulphate. The correspondent held that, while the lead sulphate did not pass into
solution, persons drinking the supernatant liquid from Akoz (the “medicinal
mineral water” is made by adding Akoz to ordinary water) might inadvertently
swallow some of the powder. He was inclined to believe that this might
account for a case of lead poisoning which had been observed in a patient
who had been taking Akoz.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it has been demonstrated by Carlson and Woelfel (Carlson,
A.&nbsp;J., and Woelfel, A.: Solubility of Lead Sulphate and Basic Lead Carbonate
in Human Gastric Juice<span class="ell">...</span>. In Hygiene of the Painter’s Trade by Alice
Hamilton, Bull. of U.&nbsp;S. Bureau of Labor Statistics No. 120, May 13, 1913,
<span class="pagenum" title="329"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a></span>pp.&nbsp;22–32) that even small quantities of lead sulphate when taken into the
system for a long time, have produced lead poisoning, the laboratory deemed it
important that the products be examined for lead.</p>

<p>A specimen of “Akoz Powder” submitted to the Council by the Natura
Company and contained in a sifter-top can was taken for analysis. The contents
of the can were thoroughly mixed. To determine the presence of lead some
of the powder was extracted with ammonium acetate solution.</p>


<h4>Details of Analysis</h4>

<p>Qualitative tests showed the presence of lead and sulphate in the ammonium
acetate solution.</p>

<p>The presence of lead was demonstrated by the black precipitate with hydrogen
sulphid, the yellow precipitate with potassium chromate and the typical yellowish
crystalline precipitate with potassium iodin.</p>

<p>The presence of sulphates in the ammonium acetate solution was shown
by the formation of a precipitate with barium chlorid solution and acetic acid.</p>

<p>Two 2&nbsp;gm. samples (A and B) were taken for the quantitative determination
of lead. Each was treated repeatedly with a saturated solution of ammonium
acetate until the filtered ammonium acetate solution gave no appreciable
precipitate with potassium chromate solution. The ammonium acetate extractions
from each specimen were combined and treated with hydrogen sulphid, the
precipitated lead sulphid filtered off and washed, and ignited with sulphuric
acid at a low heat. The crucible with the residue of lead sulphate was cooled
and weighed.</p>

<p>A yielded 0.0469&nbsp;gm., or 2.34 per cent., lead sulphate.<br />
B yielded 0.0440&nbsp;gm., or 2.20 per cent., lead sulphate.</p>

<p>While the laboratory has no evidence to show that the amount of lead-sulphate
thus found to be present is likely to prove harmful, the following
cautionary letter was sent to the Natura Company:</p>

<p>“According to information which you sent to the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry your product “Akoz” does not contain lead. In view of reports
received ascribing symptoms, resulting from the internal use of Akoz, to chronic
lead poisoning, an examination of a specimen of Akoz Powder, which you sent
to the Council, was made. This examination indicates the presence in Akoz
Powder of about 2.2 per cent. lead sulphate. In view of the disastrous results
likely to follow the internal use of products containing even small amounts of
lead, the above is submitted to you for your consideration.”</p>

<p>No reply to the foregoing was received from the Natura Company.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory, 1916, p.&nbsp;103.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>SODIUM ACETATE IN WARMING BOTTLES</h3>


<p>Recently the laboratory’s attention was called to the “ThermoR Waterless
Hot Bottle,” manufactured by the Royal Thermophor Sales Co., New York.
The following claims appear in one of the advertising pamphlets:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is moist heat.” “Rubber hot-water (?&emsp;?&emsp;?) naturally give a <i>moist</i> heat.” It
(ThermoR) gives a <i>dry</i> heat.</p>

<p>“The ‘THERMOR’ Bottle is <i>not</i> a hot-water bottle&mdash;it acts on a principle that is entirely
different and new.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. gives you <i>first, last and all the time</i> a fixed degree of dry usable heat&mdash;a heat that
holds steadily at 125 degrees for fully twelve hours&mdash;you will easily see why it is that
‘THERMOR’ relieves and cures where hot-water bottles fail.”</p></div>

<p>The bottle was nickel plated, 8<span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub></span> inches in diameter and 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> inches thick,
and in appearance resembled an exaggerated closed Ingersoll watch.</p>

<p>The bottle is not flexible and weighs 3<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> pounds. The contents consisted
essentially of sodium acetate. This salt melts when heated. When it cools the
<span class="pagenum" title="330"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a></span>temperature inside the bottle is relatively constant, as it will remain at the
“freezing point” until all of the sodium acetate has solidified. The duration of
the time that it remains warm when well wrapped is simply in inverse proportion
to the conductivity of the surrounding environment. When two ordinary
towels were carefully arranged about it, the air between the bottle and the
wrappings was maintained at a temperature of 40–50&nbsp;C. (104–122&nbsp;F.) for a
period of eight hours.</p>

<p>The company’s implication that the heat given out by the Thermor bottle
differs from that given out by an ordinary hot-water bottle is an absurdity.
The use of sodium acetate in the preparation of warming bottles has been in
practice many years, and is not “a principle that is entirely different and
new.” Furthermore, the therapeutic claims are extravagant.&mdash;(<i>From Reports
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory, 1916, p.&nbsp;105.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>ANTI-SYPHILITIC COMPOUND (SWEENY)</h3>


<p>A specimen of Anti-Syphilitic Compound (Sweeny), sold by The National
Laboratories of Pittsburgh, was received from a physician. The package
(1 ounce size) has been opened by the sender and about three fourths of the
contents removed.</p>

<p>From the rather indefinite statements in the literature of the manufacturer
it is gathered that the preparation is claimed to be a “sterile, oily emulsion”
which contains <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span> grain of mercuric benzoate in each 5 minims, together with
some sodium chlorid. According to information furnished by the Laboratory’s
correspondent, the price asked for the preparation is $15 an ounce.</p>

<p>The quantity of the preparation received was too small to permit a complete
examination, but, from the tests which it was possible to make, the preparation
appears to be an aqueous solution containing some suspended matter and small
quantities of mercuric benzoate and a chlorid, presumably sodium chlorid.
There was no evidence of the presence of an “oily emulsion.” Quantitative
tests indicated the presence of a mercuric salt, equivalent to about 0.2783&nbsp;gm.
of crystallized mercuric benzoate per 100&nbsp;c.c. This corresponds to about 0.00086&nbsp;gm.
in each 5 minims, or about 26.5 per cent. of the amount claimed.&mdash;(<i>From
Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory, 1916, p.&nbsp;106.</i>)</p>

<h3>“AMBRINE” AND PARAFFIN FILMS<a name="FNanchor_H_172" id="FNanchor_H_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_172" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></h3>

<p class="author">Paul Nicholas Leech, Ph.D.</p>


<p>In the last year or so, the hot-wax or paraffin treatment of burns has been
widely discussed both in medical and lay periodicals. Although the treatment is
simply a modification of the well-known use of oil and ointments, it has received
unusual attention, owing to the widespread sensationalism following the exploitation
in France of a secret and therefore mysterious mixture, “Ambrine,” the
formula of Dr. Barthe de Sandfort. Owing to this publicity, it seemed desirable
to investigate the chemical composition, and to compare its physical properties
with other waxlike substances.</p>

<p>“Ambrine” is promoted as a dressing for burns, frostbites, neuritis, varicose
ulcers, phlebitis, neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica, gout, etc. It is a smoky-appearing
substance, resembling paraffin in consistency and without odor. For application,
“Ambrine” is melted and applied to the wound either with a brush or
with a specially devised atomizer. It cools quickly, and leaves a solid, protecting
film.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/331a.jpg" width="350" height="292" alt="" />
<div>“Ambrine” has been exploited in the United States for some time. To physicians it was
sold under the name “Hyperthermine.” Above is a photographic reproduction (reduced) of a
portion of a booklet describing “Hyperthermine,” which has been in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> office for
some years.</div>

home he sought a substitute, and finally made a mixture of paraffin, oil of
amber and amber resin. This was applied hot, serving as a firm poultice.
“Years later, he went on service to a railway in China and was in Yunnan at
the time of the incendiary insurrection, and many badly burned Chinese were
<span class="pagenum" title="332"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></span>brought in for treatment. Remembering that Ambroise Paré treated such cases
with hot oil, he tried the effect of covering the burn with his melted ambrine,
which at once glazes over, forming a coat impervious to the air, and his patients
ceased to suffer.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_166_174" id="FNanchor_166_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_174" class="fnanchor">166</a></span></p>

<p>“Ambrine” has been sold in America under two names: “Hyperthermine,”
as exploited to physicians, and “Thermozine,” as advertised to the public.
Physical comparison alone shows that Ambrine as now sold differs from
“Hyperthermine” of a few years ago; the probable reason is that “Ambrine”
has changed its formula. This is borne out by Matas<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_167_175" id="FNanchor_167_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_175" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> who states that de Sandfort
“admitted that Ambrine was a compound of paraffin, oil of sesame and
resins, but was not at liberty to divulge its exact composition, as the formula
and manufacture of this substance was now the property of a private corporation,
which was exploiting it as a proprietary and secret remedy.” The later
formula differs from the original.</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing paraffin preparations, two others have recently been
placed on the American market, “Parresine” (nonsecret) and “Mulene” (secret).</p>


<h5>ANALYSIS OF AMBRINE</h5>

<p>“Ambrine” comes in rectangular cakes, about 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> inches wide, 6 inches long
and <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> inch thick. It is moderately soft, but somewhat brittle at ordinary
room temperature. A black substance is present, which evidently settles out
during the compounding, as in one side of the cake these particles can be
clearly discerned by holding it up to the light; in the other side there are no
suspended particles. When melted, the solution is not clear, and a sediment
forms. The melting point (U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. method; see later) is 48.4&nbsp;C. The
plasticity and <span class="nowrap">ductility<a name="FNanchor_168_176" id="FNanchor_168_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_176" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> are 27 and 30.5, respectively. It is pliable and strong
at body temperature. The saponification number and acid number are both
very low, but a fatty oil is present. Tests indicated oil of sesame. Ninety-eight
per cent. of “Ambrine” is soluble in ether; this soluble portion may be treated
with low-boiling ligroin (petroleum ether), out of which, on standing, a black
asphalt-like substance separates. Of the ether-insoluble substance, 65 per cent.
is soluble in chloroform. The remaining insoluble substance contains a small
amount of silica and vegetable fiber. The paraffin obtained from “Ambrine”
melted at 48.6&nbsp;C. As a result of various experiments, it appears that the
composition of “Ambrine” is essentially as follows:</p>

<h5>OTHER PROPRIETARY FILMS</h5>

<p>A cursory examination of “Mulene,” manufactured by the Mulene Company,
Pittsburgh, was also made. This appears to contain paraffin, beeswax, a fat-soluble
red dye and considerable rosin. When heated carefully in a beaker, the
rosin “sticks” to the bottom, and does not go into solution readily<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_169_177" id="FNanchor_169_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_177" class="fnanchor">169</a></span></p>

<p>“Paresine,”<a name="FNanchor_170_178" id="FNanchor_170_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_178" class="fnanchor">170</a> according to the manufactures, is a mixture composed of
paraffin, 94 to 96 per cent.; gum elemi, 0.20 to 0.25 per cent.; Japan wax, 0.40 to
0.50 per cent.; asphalt, 0.20 to 0.25 per cent., and eucalyptol, 2 per cent., the
whole being colored with alkannin and gentian violet<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_171_179" id="FNanchor_171_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_179" class="fnanchor">171</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="333"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></span></p>

<h5>FORMULA FOR PARAFFIN FILM</h5>

<p>In a recent article, Sollmann<a name="FNanchor_172_180" id="FNanchor_172_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_180" class="fnanchor">172</a> presented various suggestions for the compounding
of paraffin films. Some of the formulas were promising and others
were not, but all were simple. He did not try to imitate “Ambrine.” Lieut.-Col.
A.&nbsp;J. <span class="nowrap">Hull<a name="FNanchor_173_181" id="FNanchor_173_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_181" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> of the Royal Army Medical Corps, after experimenting with different
combinations, concluded that a mixture of “1 part resorcin, 2 parts
eucalyptus oil, 5 parts olive oil, 25 parts soft paraffin [petrolatum<span class="nowrap">]<a name="FNanchor_174_182" id="FNanchor_174_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_182" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> and 67
parts hard paraffin” served the purpose as well as “Ambrine.” The following
formula, which might be called Asphalt-Paraffin No. 21, much more closely
resembles “Ambrine,” and it seems to have certain advantages, due to the use
of a more suitable grade of paraffin:</p>

<p>About 10&nbsp;c.c. of “asphalt varnish” (B. Asphaltum<span class="nowrap">)<a name="FNanchor_176_184" id="FNanchor_176_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_184" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> is placed in a beaker
and heated on the steam bath for one-half hour. From 3 to 5 drops, delivered
from a 1&nbsp;c.c. pipet, are then placed in a casserole, and 1.5&nbsp;c.c. of olive oil
added. The mixture is heated and stirred for a few minutes until perfect
solution is effected. To this is then added, with stirring, the paraffin, which
has been previously melted. When it is cooled, a brown solid is obtained<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_177_185" id="FNanchor_177_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_185" class="fnanchor">177</a></span>
The physical factors of this paraffin mixture are, melting point 45.4&nbsp;C. (U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.
method); plasticity, 28.5; ductility, 29; it is very pliable and strong at 38&nbsp;C.,
and adheres exceedingly well to the skin, although it detaches easily. This
mixture, which is easy to prepare, is inexpensive, the cost of the materials
being approximately 10 cents a pound.</p>

<p>Both Hull and Sollmann noticed that tarlike substances and melted paraffin
do not mix well. This is noticeable in “Ambrine,” which cannot be called an
“elegant” preparation. The difficulty may be overcome by first mixing hot
olive oil and asphalt; the asphalt will then go into solution. It is interesting
to note that the suggested formula (as well as others which were also prepared)
<span class="pagenum" title="334"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a></span>is not as plastic as the paraffin itself<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_178_186" id="FNanchor_178_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_186" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> This is also true of “Ambrine.”
On the other hand, the melting point of the paraffin is higher. <i>The important
point, however, in compounding all paraffin preparations, is to select a proper
grade of paraffin as elaborated below.</i></p>


<h5>EXAMINATION OF PARAFFINS AND PARAFFIN PREPARATIONS</h5>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/334.jpg" width="375" height="584" alt="" />

</div>

<p>The name “paraffin” generally applies to a colorless and tasteless waxlike
substance that is solid at ordinary temperature. It is composed of saturated
hydrocarbons, that is, they are unable to take up any more hydrogen, and
<span class="pagenum" title="335"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a></span>thereby are quite stable; the hydrocarbons in paraffin have the general formula
of C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>, ranging as high as C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>50</sub> to C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>56</sub>. Paraffin may be found in
crude form in coal, from which source the first paraffin candles were made. It
may be produced from the distillation of brown coal, as in Germany, or from
bituminous shale. In America, it is obtained chiefly from the distillation of
crude petroleum, being in the residue after the distillation of such products as
naphtha (gasoline), kerosene and the lubricating oils. The residue is treated
by one of a number of processes causing the unpurified solid paraffin to be
made available. The crude paraffin is either sold as such, or is refined. Paraffin
or “paraffin waxes<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_179_187" id="FNanchor_179_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_187" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> are designated in the trade by their melting points (which
in the “American standard” is expressed in Fahrenheit degrees), and as to
their state of refinement as “crude,” “semirefined” and “fully refined” paraffin.
There are certain chemical and physical differences so that two refined waxes
having the same melting point would not have the same plasticity. The higher
melting point varieties of paraffin are hard and tough at room temperature:
when melted, paraffin expands and forms a thin mobile liquid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/335.jpg" width="375" height="261" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction from a booklet on “Thermozine” giving the conditions in which

</div>

<p>The significant requirements of paraffin for surgical dressings are that it
should be solid at body temperature, at the same time having flexibility and
adhesiveness, together with a certain amount of strength. A number of brands
of paraffin are sold in the United States, so that it seemed advisable to examine
some of them and compare them with certain paraffin-film preparations. They
were tested as to their melting points, plasticity, ductility, strength of film, etc.</p>

<p><i>Melting Point Determination.</i>&mdash;The melting point was determined by the
method of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia IX, p.&nbsp;596. The melting point as obtained
by this method is lower than the melting point used by manufacturers of
paraffin (after conversion to Fahrenheit).</p>

<p><i>Pliability and Ductility, Limit Temperature.</i><span class="nowrap"><a name="FNanchor_180_188" id="FNanchor_180_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_188" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>&mdash;A little of the melted wax
was poured from a teaspoon on the surface of the water at about 40&nbsp;C., in
a tin pan (bread mold). This formed a fairly thin film. The temperature of
<span class="pagenum" title="336"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a></span>the water was then lowered by the addition of cold water. At each temperature
the pliability and ductility were tested thus:</p>

<p><i>Pliability Test.</i>&mdash;The film, immersed in water, was doubled on itself, note
being taken whether or not it broke.</p>

<p><i>Ductility Test.</i>&mdash;The film was pulled under water, note being taken whether
it stretched on being pulled and broke with a ragged fracture; or whether it
broke sharp without stretching. It is desirable that the pliability and ductility
be preserved at as low a temperature as possible.</p>

<p><i>Cotton Films, Adhesives and Detachability.</i><a href="#Footnote_180_188" class="fnanchor">180</a>&mdash;The melted wax was applied
as it would be for burns; namely, a thin layer was painted on the inner surface
of the forearm with a camel’s hair brush<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_181_189" id="FNanchor_181_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_189" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> a transverse strip about an inch
wide being made. This was covered with a very thin layer of absorbent cotton,
and over this another layer of melted wax was painted. As soon as this had
cooled a little, it was covered by a few layers of bandage and left on for at
least an hour. At the end of that time, the bandage was removed. The cotton
film should be found at the place at which it was applied, showing that it is
sufficiently adherent. It should detach without “pulling” the skin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/336.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (greatly reduced) of the carton in which “Ambrine” is now sold.</div>
</div>

<p>The results of these tests are given in the accompanying table. It can be
seen that nearly all the paraffins examined have properties which would make
them useful, the notable exceptions being Nos. 8, 15 and 16. The more satisfactory
products would be those having a melting point about 47&nbsp;C., ductility of
30 or below, and plasticity of 28 or below. The paraffin described in the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia is not so satisfactory, the required melting point being between
50 and 57&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>The use of paraffin bandages has been suggested by <span class="nowrap">Fisher<a name="FNanchor_182_190" id="FNanchor_182_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_190" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> and Sollmann<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_183_191" id="FNanchor_183_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_191" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>
In such cases, it may very likely be that a paraffin of higher melting point would
be more satisfactory, owing to its greater resistance and tougher fiber.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="337"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a></span></p>

<h5>SUMMARY</h5>

<p>1. “Ambrine” is essentially paraffin in which a small amount of fatty and
asphalt-like body is incorporated; like most secret mixtures, its composition
varies.</p>

<p>2. A simple formula for a paraffin film, similar in chemical composition but
superior in physical properties to “Ambrine,” is that described as Formula 21.
The superiority is due to using a grade of paraffin that is better adapted to the
purpose. The cost of materials is about 10 cents a pound.</p>

<p>3. The properties of the paraffin used for a surgical dressing are important.
A number of different grades have been examined, in order to determine the
ones that appear most promising. Paraffins Nos. 3, 4, 10, 11 and 25 are the
best in the table, and surpass “Ambrine” itself.</p>

<p>4. It is exceedingly probable that further experience will show that for most
purposes simple paraffin will serve just as well as the mixtures&mdash;if, indeed, not
better.</p>

<p class="tac fs85">(<i>Reprinted from the Annual Report of the Chemical Laboratory of The American Medical
Association, Vol. 10 (1917), p.&nbsp;32</i>)</p>

<p>Since the foregoing was published, two other products&mdash;“Cerelene” and
“Stanolind Surgical Wax”&mdash;were submitted to the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry for investigation as to their acceptability for inclusion in New and
Non­official Remedies. In this connection the Laboratory was requested to
examine them.</p>

<p>“Cerelene” is manufactured by the Holliday Laboratories, Pittsburgh. According
to the manufacturers, “Cerelene” is a compound composed of 84 per cent.
paraffin, 15 per cent. myricyl palmitate and 1 per cent. elemi gum. As ordinarily
marketed, “Cerelene” contains the following materials: To the beeswax is
added Oil of Eucalyptus, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., 2 per cent., and Betanaphthol, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., 0.25
per cent. The manufacturer further states that the myricyl palmitate is a purified
form of beeswax, free from all impurities, acids, etc., which is solely manufactured
by this company and for which patents are pending. The properties
described for “Cerelene” were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When cold, Cerelene is a solid wax-like cake of a fine yellow brown color. On exposure to
air for long periods, the amber color darkens to some extent. It is entirely free from solids,
odorless and tasteless; does not separate or change when melted repeatedly, and cannot in the
melted state be separated by fractional crystallization. It is entirely neutral to indicators
being perfectly free from both acids and bases.</p>

<h3>THE STABILITY OF IODINE OINTMENTS</h3>

<p class="author">L. E. Warren, Ph.C., B.S.</p>


<p>In general, the literature on the keeping qualities of iodine ointment, and on
the stability of iodine if mixed with ointment bases, is confusing. The recorded
evidence is often contradictory. The attention of the writer was brought to this
<span class="pagenum" title="338"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a></span>condition by studies of several proprietary preparations, Iodex<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_184_192" id="FNanchor_184_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_192" class="fnanchor">184</a></span> Iod-Izd-Oil<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_185_193" id="FNanchor_185_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_193" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>
Iocamfen, and Iocamfen Ointment<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_186_194" id="FNanchor_186_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_194" class="fnanchor">186</a></span></p>

<p>Iodex was sold under the claim that it is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. an embodiment of vaporized iodine, in an organic base, reduced and standardized
at 5 per cent. by incorporation with a refined petroleum product.”</p></div>

<p>The exact composition of Iodex is a trade secret. Analysis showed that it
contains petrolatum-like substances and combined iodine, the latter probably
in combination with oleic acid. Tests for free iodine were made in five specimens
of Iodex. In one of these no free iodine was present; in the others the
merest traces were found.</p>

<p>Two years ago a preparation called “Iod-Izd-Oil” was examined. This was
claimed to contain 2 per cent. of free iodine in liquid petrolatum. At the time
of the examination the age of the preparation was not known, but it had been
obtained just prior to the analysis, and was thought not to be very old. The
analysis showed that it contained but about 0.43 per cent. of iodine, all of which
was in a free state. The fact that all of the iodine present was in the free state
appeared to indicate that iodine is relatively stable in liquid petrolatum
solutions.</p>

<p>Iocamfen is a liquid composed of iodine, camphor and phenol. It was claimed
to contain 10 per cent. of free iodine. Analysis showed that it contained 9.3
per cent. of total iodine (of which 7.5 per cent. was present in an uncombined
state), 66.1 per cent. of camphor and 19.7 per cent. of phenol. After storing for
several months a second assay of Iocamfen showed no appreciable loss in iodine
content. This would indicate that iodine is relatively stable in presence of
phenol and camphor, although immediately after mixing there is some loss of
free iodine. The Iocamfen Ointment was supposed to contain 50 per cent. of
Iocamfen (equivalent to 5 per cent. of free iodine) in a lard-wax-cacaobutter
base. The analysis showed that the ointment contained but 0.4 per cent. of free
iodine, the balance being in combination. From the results of the examination,
and from correspondence with the manufacturers (Schering and Glatz), it
became evident that the only plausible explanation for the loss of free iodine in
the preparation of Iocamfen Ointment from Iocamfen lay in the combination of
the free iodine with the ingredients of the ointment base. It seems likely that
the free iodine originally present in Iocamfen for the most part had gradually
gone into combination with the fatty substances after the ointment had been
prepared.</p>

<p>The literature was then examined to determine the consensus of opinion
concerning the stability of iodine in iodine ointment. In the older literature
the belief that iodine ointment is unstable appears to be quite general. Such
statements as the following are typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ointment should be prepared only when wanted for use, for it undergoes change if
kept, losing its deep, orange-brown color, and becoming pale upon its surface<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_187_195" id="FNanchor_187_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_195" class="fnanchor">187</a></span></p>

<p>It is better to prepare it only as it is required for use<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_188_196" id="FNanchor_188_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_196" class="fnanchor">188</a></span></p>

<p>This ointment must not be dispensed unless it has recently been prepared<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_189_197" id="FNanchor_189_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_197" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>
</p></div>

<p>In 1909 Lythgoe,<a name="FNanchor_190_198" id="FNanchor_190_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_198" class="fnanchor">190</a> of the Massachusetts Board of Health laboratory, reported
an examination of four samples of iodine ointment. Three were found to be
pure, the fourth was low in iodine. Experiments showed that iodine ointment
deteriorates rapidly; consequently, no further collections of samples were made.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="339"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a></span></p>
<p>In 1912 Pullen<a name="FNanchor_191_199" id="FNanchor_191_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_199" class="fnanchor">191</a> reported that he had prepared two specimens of iodine ointment
according to the British Pharmacopeia, one being from new lard and the
other from a specimen of lard at least 2 years old. Assays for free iodine were
carried out immediately after the preparations were made, and at intervals
afterward up to four months. The following values were found:</p>

<p>Pullen found that the loss in free iodine could be accounted for by the iodine
which had gone into combination with the fats of the ointment base.</p>

<p>Pullen also found that if the potassium iodide and glycerin were omitted in
the preparation of the ointment, the loss in free iodine was very rapid, the
preparation containing practically no free iodine (only <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub></span>) after a few
hours. He concludes that the use of potassium iodide and glycerin is necessary
for the preservation of the ointment. He obtained specimens of iodine ointment
in drug stores, and assayed them for free iodine. It is to be presumed that the
ages of the several specimens were not known. The results are found in the
following table:</p>

<p>Iodine ointment has been official in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia since 1870.
Briefly, the method now used for making the preparation is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Four gm. of iodine, 4&nbsp;gm. of potassium iodide and 12&nbsp;gm. of glycerin
are weighed into a tared mortar and the mixture triturated until the iodine
and potassium iodide are dissolved and a dark, reddish-brown, syrupy
liquid is produced. Eighty gm. of benzoinated lard are then added in small
portions and with trituration after each addition. The mass is then triturated
until of uniform consistence<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_193_201" id="FNanchor_193_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_201" class="fnanchor">193</a></span></p></div>

<p>Iodine ointment is officialized also in several foreign pharmacopeias,
although the iodine strength of the several preparations is not uniform. The
formula in the British Pharmacopeia is exactly like that in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
except that pure lard is directed to be used instead of benzoinated lard.
Some of the foreign pharmacopeias also specify that the preparation must be
freshly prepared when wanted. In the earlier editions the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
directed the ointment to be prepared by using water as the solvent for the
potassium iodide. In the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia VIII the formula was changed
so as to employ glycerin, and that solvent is now official. Water is still prescribed
as the potassium iodide solvent by the Pharmacopeias of the Netherlands
and of France.</p>

<p>From the examination of the literature it seems probable that iodine ointments
which contain petrolatum products only as the ointment bases are apt to
be relatively stable, so far as the content of free iodine is concerned. On the
other hand, ointments the bases of which contain fats of the unsaturated fatty
acid series, such as oleic acid, do not satisfactorily preserve the iodine in the
free state. In the latter class it seems likely that the iodine enters into combination
with the unsaturated fatty acids. Accordingly, on theoretical grounds,
an ointment base composed of pure stearin (if such substance were available)
but softened by an admixture of liquid petrolatum would preserve the iodine
satisfactorily. Cocoanut oil (iodine No. 8) ought to be suitable also if mixed
with hard paraffin.</p>

<p>Since the literature was not sufficiently concordant to warrant positive conclusions
concerning the stability of ointments containing free iodine, it seemed
worth while to conduct experiments with preparations of known origin. Accordingly,
a number of preparations containing free iodine were made under varying
conditions and each was assayed for its free iodine content immediately after
its manufacture and from time to time later.</p>

<p>Leaf lard of the best quality obtainable was purchased from a butcher. This
was rendered in an open dish on the steam bath. The preparation was of a fine
color, and uniform consistence and had a faint but not unpleasant odor. Two
specimens of lard were furnished by the research department of Armour and
Company. An effort was made to procure specimens of lard having iodine
absorption numbers as far apart as possible, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, one with a low and the other
with a high iodine value. This was done in order to determine whether the
keeping qualities of the ointments prepared from the two would be alike.</p>

<p>One of the specimens (<i>a</i>) was described as</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Natural lard; iodine value, 57.1. Leaf lard used exclusively for butterine and benzoinated
lard.”</p></div>

<p>The other specimen was described as</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Prime steam lard. Good, commercial grade of lard for general use; iodine value, 69.0.”</p></div>

<p>The iodine absorption numbers of the three specimens were determined by
the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. process to be as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Armour specimen (<i>b</i>)</span></div></td><td class="tal pl03">67.55</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Each specimen was benzoinated according to the process described in the
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. IX and 100&nbsp;gm. of iodine ointment were prepared from each according
to the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. process. Another specimen was made from benzoinated lard
<span class="pagenum" title="342"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a></span>and iodine <span class="nowrap">only<a name="FNanchor_194_202" id="FNanchor_194_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_202" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> without the addition of either glycerin or potassium iodide.
This was made to contain 4 per cent. of iodine.</p>

<p>Immediately after preparation each of these iodine ointments was assayed for
free iodine, and each was reassayed at intervals later. The method for the
determination of iodine in the ointment was that employed in this laboratory
for the determination of iodine in Iocamfen Ointment<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_195_203" id="FNanchor_195_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_203" class="fnanchor">195</a></span> It is essentially the
same as was employed by Pullen for the determination of uncombined iodine in
iodine ointment<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_196_204" id="FNanchor_196_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_204" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> As carried out in this laboratory for iodine ointment it is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From 5 to 8&nbsp;gm. of the ointment were weighed in a small porcelain
capsule, the capsule and contents placed in a 16&nbsp;oz. salt mouth bottle together
with 20&nbsp;c.c. of chloroform, 10&nbsp;c.c. of potassium iodide solution and 40&nbsp;c.c.
of water. Tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate was slowly added with agitation
until the pink color of the chloroform layer had nearly disappeared. A
little soluble starch was then added and the titration continued until a blue
color in the aqueous layer could no longer be obtained by repeated shaking.</p></div>

<p class="ml2em fs85">* This slight rise in iodine content followed by a fall could not be accounted for. The
specimen was believed to have been very thoroughly mixed at the time of manufacture.</p>

<p>That the fatty constituents of the ointment contained iodine after the preparation
had been made for some time was demonstrated. Some of the material
was examined as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A portion of the ointment which had been made for nearly three
months was shaken in a separator with chloroform and a dilute mixture
of potassium iodide and sodium thiosulphate solutions. After all
of the free iodine had been removed the chloroformic solution of the
fats was washed several times with a very dilute solution of sodium
thiosulphate. The chloroformic solution was filtered, evaporated and
the residue dried over sulphuric acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_197_205" id="FNanchor_197_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_205" class="fnanchor">197</a></span></p></div>

<p>The separated fat was then tested for iodine by Kendall’s method<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_198_206" id="FNanchor_198_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_206" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> It was
found to contain iodine in considerable amounts, but quantitative determinations
were not made.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="343"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a></span></p>
<p>The Pharmacopeia of the Netherlands directs that iodine ointment shall
contain 3 per cent. of potassium iodide and 2 per cent. of iodine instead of
equal proportions (4 per cent. of each) as prescribed by the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia.
Likewise the French Pharmacopeia directs that 10 per cent. of potassium
iodide and only 2 per cent. of iodine shall be used. Both of these pharmacopeias
use water instead of glycerin as the solvent. Loose combinations
of iodine and potassium iodide, such as are represented by the compound having
the formula KI<sub>3</sub>, have been described. The quantity of potassium iodide
prescribed by the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia for the preparation of iodine ointment
is not sufficient to form such a compound as KI<sub>3</sub> with all of the iodine directed
to be used. Since some of the pharmacopeias use larger proportions of potassium
iodide (more than sufficient to form the compound, KI<sub>3</sub>), it seemed worth
while to determine whether an ointment containing a greater proportion of
potassium iodide than that required by the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia would be more
stable than the official article. Accordingly a specimen was prepared to contain
4 per cent. of iodine, 8 per cent. of potassium iodide (twice the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.
requirement), 12 per cent. of glycerin and 76 per cent. of lard. This was
assayed for its free iodine content immediately after preparation, and found
to contain 3.68 per cent. Nine days later it contained 3.70 per cent. Another
specimen of the same iodine strength prepared from grade No. 2 of commercial
lard assayed 3.69 per cent. at the initial assay, and seven days later
3.40 per cent. From these experiments it seems likely that the free iodine content
of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia iodine ointment could be raised somewhat by
increasing the proportion of potassium iodide.</p>

<p>The results of these studies confirm the findings of Pullen and of Fried in
all essential particulars. It appears that during the process of manufacture
of iodine ointment about 20 per cent. of the free iodine goes into combination
with the fatty constituents of the ointment. On standing for a month approximately
an additional 5 per cent. goes into combination, after which there is
practically no loss in free iodine content. In other words iodine ointment
which is a month old is a relatively stable preparation. It appears to make
no noticeable difference upon the rate and amount of iodine absorption whether
the lard from which the ointment is made has a high or a low iodine absorption
value. The composition of iodine ointment, which has been made sufficiently
long to have reached equilibrium, is approximately as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia requirement that iodine ointment shall be freshly
prepared when wanted appears to be unnecessary. Probably most pharmaceutical
manufacturers are aware of this, for many of them include the preparation
in their trade lists. The presence of an iodide appears to be necessary,
to prevent practically all of the iodine from entering into combination with the
fat<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_199_207" id="FNanchor_199_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_207" class="fnanchor">199</a></span>&mdash;(<i>From the American Journal of Pharmacy, August, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>IODOLENE AND THE SOLUBILITY OF IODIN
IN LIQUID PETROLATUM</h3>


<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry was asked to examine a preparation
submitted with the statement that it was “iodin crystals incorporated in
a petroleum product.” The name “Iodolene” was proposed by the promoters,
providing the product was found eligible for New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>Iodolene was stated to have been prepared by treating a liquid petrolatum,
obtained from Gulf Coast petroleum, with an excess of iodin; the mixture was
subsequently “placed in an oven for three hours.” The claim was made that
this method of procedure produced a preparation containing more iodin than
market specimens which had been examined, namely: “over 1.50 per cent.
free iodine.”</p>

<p>Two specimens of the product were submitted, one stated to have been
unfiltered, and the other filtered. Both of the specimens emitted a strong odor
of hydrogen sulphide upon removing the stopper from the respective containers.</p>

<p><i>Iodin Content of Iodolene.</i>&mdash;The iodin content of the filtered specimen was
determined thus: A weighed amount&mdash;3 to 5 gm.&mdash;was transferred to a
separator by means of 20&nbsp;c.c. of ligroin, used in portions. Twenty c.c. of 10
per cent. potassium iodid solution was added and the free iodin titrated with
tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate solution (with agitation), the end point
being the absence of a yellow color in the <i>aqueous</i> layer. The amount of free
iodin was found to be 1.32 per cent.</p>

<p><i>The Solubility of Iodin in Liquid Petrolatum.</i>&mdash;To determine the solubility
of iodin in Liquid Petrolatum, 200&nbsp;c.c. of Liquid Petrolatum-Squibb (said to
be composed of hydrocarbons of the naphthene series) and 200&nbsp;c.c. of Stanolind
Liquid Paraffin (said to be composed chiefly of marsh gas hydrocarbons)
were each treated with 5&nbsp;gm. of iodin crystals. The two mixtures were maintained
for a week at a temperature somewhat above that of the room and agitated
occasionally. Each was then cooled to room temperature (about 22&nbsp;C.),
agitated for a day and then filtered. The amount of iodin in the preparation
made with Liquid Petrolatum-Squibb was found to be 1.42 per cent. The iodin
content of the preparation made with Stanolind Liquid Paraffin was 1.30
per cent.</p>

<p>In view of these findings the prospective manufacturer was advised that the
Council cannot countenance a proprietary name for an unofficial, simple solution
of iodin in liquid petrolatum.&mdash;(<i>From Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory,

<h3>AMERICAN-MADE SYNTHETIC DRUGS&mdash;I</h3>

<h4>Examination of American-Made Acetylsalicylic Acid</h4>

<p class="author">Paul Nicholas Leech, Ph.D.</p>


<p>At the request of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory has undertaken examinations of American-made synthetic
drugs. The most extensively used synthetic is acetyl­salicylic acid and hence
an investigation of this product was deemed expedient.</p>

<p>For seventeen years acetyl­salicylic acid was protected by a United States
Patent (the proprietors were not given a patent in other countries) and sold
under the name “Aspirin.” In February, 1917, the patent expired, and since
then a number of firms have engaged in the manufacture of acetyl­salicylic acid,
<span class="pagenum" title="345"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></span>selling it either as such or as aspirin, modified, of course, by a distinctive firm
designation. During this period the former manufacturers (The Bayer Co.,
New York, in past years called Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Co., New York)
have been extensively advertising, both to physicians and the public, the alleged
superior qualities of their product. The chemical examination, therefore, was
concerned chiefly with tests of purity, and the comparison of the American
brands with the formerly patented product.</p>

<p>In European countries, acetyl­salicylic <span class="nowrap">acid<a name="FNanchor_200_208" id="FNanchor_200_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_208" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> is described in the various pharmacopeias
as a condensation product of acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride
with salicylic acid (<i>o</i>-hydroxy­benzoic acid). Generally the test of identification
is hydrolysis of acetyl­salicylic acid and qualitative tests for acetic acid
and salicylic acid. For purposes of purity the requirements are essentially
that the specimen should have a certain melting point, should show absence
of salicylic acid by means of ferric chloride (the manipulations for the tests
are variously described) and leave no appreciable ash. The two tests of
purity most generally employed, however, are the melting point and the reaction
with ferric chloride.</p>


<h5>MELTING POINT</h5>

<p>The melting point of acetyl­salicylic acid has been given at various temperatures
from 118 to 137&nbsp;C<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_201_209" id="FNanchor_201_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_209" class="fnanchor">201</a></span>; the British Pharmacopeia describes the melting
point at 133 to 135&nbsp;C.; the German Pharmacopeia “about 135&nbsp;C.;” the French
Pharmacopeia at 135&nbsp;C.; New and Non­official Remedies, 1917, 134 to 136&nbsp;C.
The Bayer Company, in the patent trial at Chicago a number of years ago,
gave among the “four infallible tests” a melting point of “about 135&nbsp;C.” Several
men have carefully determined the melting point in recent years. Emery
and <span class="nowrap">Wright<a name="FNanchor_202_210" id="FNanchor_202_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_210" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> in 1912 found that “Aspirin, Bayer” melted at 130.5 to 131&nbsp;C.
In France, <span class="nowrap">François<a name="FNanchor_203_211" id="FNanchor_203_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_211" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> has determined the melting point of pure acetyl­salicylic
acid, which, according to his method, is 132&nbsp;C. When various samples of
acetyl­salicylic acid were examined in this laboratory, it was found that the
melting point of none was as high as that described in New and Non­official
Remedies or the British, French, or German pharmacopeias when taken according
to the general method of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, Vol. 9, p.&nbsp;596. On
critical observation, it may be seen that the melting point of acetyl­salicylic
acid is preceded and accompanied by decomposition. If the sample in the
melting tube is heated from the original room temperature of the bath to
120&nbsp;C., the temperature of melting will be lower than if the bath is first
heated to 120&nbsp;C. and the melting-point tube then placed in the bath<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_204_212" id="FNanchor_204_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_212" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> Thus
the melting point of acetyl­salicylic acid, like so many organic compounds
which decompose and do not melt sharply, is unsatisfactory and cannot be
taken as an “infallible test” of purity, especially when determined by different
operators who do not give their method in detail. After making a large number
of melting-point determinations of acetyl­salicylic acid, alone and in parallel
<span class="pagenum" title="346"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a></span>with other operators, it was decided to use the method described in the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia modified by first heating the bath to 120&nbsp;C. before attaching
the melting-point tube to the thermometer.</p>

<p>The melting point of purified acetyl­salicylic acid was found to be 131.5 to
132.5&nbsp;C. (corr.)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_205_213" id="FNanchor_205_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_213" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> With the exception of one specimen, which was obviously
impure, the various specimens examined melted between 128 and 133&nbsp;C. as
may be seen in the accompanying table. It would appear that this range of
melting points would be more acceptable and reliable than the melting points
described in various standards.</p>


<h5>PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FREE SALICYLIC ACID</h5>

<p>It is generally conceded that the presence of salicylic acid in amounts more
than traces is deleterious. Furthermore, the amount of salicylic acid is a
good index of the purity of the acetyl­salicylic acid, because the test is so
delicate that, under favorable conditions, mere traces may be determined and,
as a rule, the better the product, the less the amount of free salicylic acid.</p>

<p>The tests appearing in various pharmacopeias for salicylic acid as an
impurity in acetyl­salicylic acid do not give concordant results, different workers
interpreting the results differently, nor are they detailed in such a manner
as to yield maximum delicacy.</p>

<p>After experimentation, it was decided to establish a “limit” test of approximately
0.1 per cent. free salicylic acid, when carried out according to the
following method:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>0.1&nbsp;gm. of the substance was placed in a dry colorimeter tube and 1&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_206_214" id="FNanchor_206_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_214" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> previously
distilled over NaOH, was added. After the acetyl­salicylic acid had dissolved, 48&nbsp;c.c. of water
and 1&nbsp;c.c. of fresh 0.1 per cent. ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O) solution were added. At the
same time a control was run by treating 1&nbsp;c.c. of a “standard” salicylate solution the same as
above<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_207_215" id="FNanchor_207_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_215" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> If within two minutes the color given by acetyl­salicylic acid is not more intense
than the color given by the “standard,” the presence of not more than 0.1 per cent. free
salicylic acid is proved<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_208_216" id="FNanchor_208_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_216" class="fnanchor">208</a></span></p>

<p>The solutions used were prepared as follows:</p>

<p>Redistilled alcohol was treated with a small amount of sodium hydroxide for twenty-four
hours, then again distilled.</p>

<p>The color standard was made by dissolving 0.116&nbsp;gm. of dried sodium salicylate in water,
adding 1 minim of glacial acetic acid, and making up to 1,000&nbsp;c.c. Each c.c. represents 0.1&nbsp;mg.
of salicylic acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_209_217" id="FNanchor_209_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_217" class="fnanchor">209</a></span></p>

<p>The ferric chloride solution was made by diluting 1&nbsp;c.c. ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O) test
solution U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. with 99&nbsp;c.c. of water. The diluted solution must be freshly prepared each day.</p></div>

<p>With one exception, all of the commercial specimens examined responded
satisfactorily to the above test showing less than 1 part salicylic acid in 1,000
<span class="pagenum" title="347"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a></span>parts acetyl­salicylic acid. The individual results are given in the accompanying
table.</p>

<h5>OTHER TESTS</h5>

<p>New and Non­official Remedies, 1917, requires that acetyl­salicylic acid shall
form a clear solution with warm sodium carbonate solution; that sulfates,
chlorides and heavy metals shall be absent; that 0.5&nbsp;gm. shall leave no weighable
ash. All the brands reported in this paper complied with these requirements.</p>

<p>So far there has been no satisfactory quantitative estimation of acetyl­salicylic
acid. True, various methods have been proposed, but they are objectionable.
It was thought that hydrolysis of acetyl­salicylic acid and then titrating
the solution by comparing the color formed by ferric chloride with that of a
standard control might yield interesting results, providing that the conditions
were alike. For this purpose 1&nbsp;gm. of acetyl­salicylic acid was dissolved in
10&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol and diluted to 1,000&nbsp;c.c. The solution was then heated at
98 to 100&nbsp;C. for two hours, allowing the alcohol to evaporate, then allowed
to stand at room temperature (22&nbsp;C.) for twenty-two hours. After adding
water sufficient to make 1,000&nbsp;c.c., it was compared colorimetrically for salicylic
acid strength. The amount of hydrolysis varied so with different samples
under the same conditions, that it was realized that an approximate assay
by this method was unreliable. If the assay were made under more exact
conditions, quantitative comparisons might be possible. In one experiment,
after sixty days the hydrolysis of the acetyl­salicylic acid was 61 per cent.,
which is in rough agreement with the work of Tsaklatos and Horsh<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_210_218" id="FNanchor_210_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_218" class="fnanchor">210</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="348"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a></span></p>

<h5>DISCUSSION</h5>

<p>Apart from the proposed revision of the standards for the melting point and
limit of salicylic acid in acetyl­salicylic acid, the examination shows that there is
no appreciable difference between the various brands of acetyl­salicylic acid
examined, all of them with one exception (acetyl­salicylic acid, Millikin, 5-grain
capsules, purchased on the open market) complying with the tests described in
this paper. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association, in past years,
has protested repeatedly against the monopoly given to the Bayer Company
for their “Aspirin,” contending that acetyl­salicylic acid (aspirin) was not new,
and that “Aspirin, Bayer” was simply a good brand of acetyl­salicylic acid
which could be bought in foreign countries at much lower prices than here.
Although the patent in the United States has expired, “Aspirin, Bayer” is still
being retailed at higher prices than other products which are now enjoying the
privilege of American manufacture.</p>

<p>Mr. Paul Bakewell,<a name="FNanchor_211_219" id="FNanchor_211_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_219" class="fnanchor">211</a> in an opinion answering the warning circular of the
Bayer Co. in reference to the use of the word “aspirin” by firms other than
Bayer, argues very ably that acetyl­salicylic acid, before the patent was granted,
meant the impure substance which was not used thera­peutically, while “aspirin”
was designated as the improved product (a new article of manufacture, the
particular acetyl­salicylic acid made under the Hoffman patent) and “is the
substance now known in pharmacy as aspirin” (statement made by an officer of
the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Co. in U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court, 1909). The products
reported in this paper are (with the one exception) the same as described in
the Hoffman patent, and, in the sense of Mr. Bakewell’s argument, are
“aspirin.” However, it would seem better if the name acetyl­salicylic acid,
instead of aspirin, were used, especially by physicians in their prescriptions
because (1) it is a generic, scientific name; (2) “Aspirin, Bayer” is sold at
higher prices than other products, whereas chemically equivalent products
sold under the descriptive name may be purchased at a lower price. Finally,
the manufacture of acetyl­salicylic acid in this country is another example of
the fact that American chemists can produce the drug synthetics, and at the
same time make products as good as, if not better than, those of German origin.</p>

<p>I express my appreciation to Dr. W.&nbsp;A. Puckner for his kind interest.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>THE STANDARDIZATION OF COMMERCIAL
BISMUTH TRIBROMPHENATE</h3>

<p class="author">William Rabak, Ph.G., Sc.B.</p>


<p>This work was begun in view of a request received by the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry from the Medical Section of the Council of National
Defense for a report on the quality of bismuth tri­brom­phenate, offered to the
government by a certain firm.</p>

<p>In submitting a specimen of its product, “Bismuth Tri­brom­phenolate,” the
firm claimed that “it is of high character, matching exactly the German product
formerly imported into this country,” and expressed the belief that it would
be found to conform to the standards for this preparation in New and Non­official
Remedies. Later a second specimen was received from the same company,
with the request that this be substituted for that first received. It was
<span class="pagenum" title="349"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></span>explained that the first had been taken from an experimental lot, and that the
second, taken from the regular factory output, was identical with the first
except that it was free from odor because of the more thorough washing to
which it had been subjected. Accordingly, the examination which is reported
below refers to the second specimen only.</p>

<p>New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, defines bismuth tri­brom­phenate as basis
bismuth tri­brom­phenate having the formula Bi(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>OH.Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and it is
required to yield not less than 49.5 per cent. of bismuth oxid (the chemical
formula requires 46.2 per cent. bismuth, or 51.6 per cent. bismuth oxid, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
and 49.2 per cent. tri­brom­phenate, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>3</sub>.OH). It describes it as a “fine,
yellow, nearly odorless and tasteless powder, neutral in reaction,” and “only
slightly soluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, liquid petrolatum and vegetable
oils.” It is required to yield tri­brom­phenol (to which a melting point of 95&nbsp;C.
is assigned) when decomposed by alkali and the alkali tri­brom­phenate decomposed
by acid, the separated tri­brom­phenol purified and dried.</p>

<p>As the New and Non­official Remedies description appeared loosely drawn&mdash;it
had been based on information furnished for the product Xeroform when
this, because of patent protection, was the only bismuth tri­brom­phenate on the
market&mdash;it was decided to include in the examination also specimens of the
two brands of Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate included in New and Non­official Remedies,
namely, Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck (Merck and Company) and
Xeroform-Heyden (The Heyden Chemical Works). The Merck specimen had
been received by the Council from Merck and Company in 1915, while the
Heyden preparation was obtained direct from the firm’s Chicago branch in
April, 1918. At this time Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck could not be obtained
from the Chicago wholesale houses.</p>

<p>All three specimens were nearly odorless. Two of the specimens (the
Research Council Specimen and Merck products) were of a lemon-yellow color,
while the Heyden preparation was of a grayish color.</p>


<h5>BISMUTH DETERMINATION</h5>

<p>Four methods for the determination of the bismuth content of the specimens
were tried:</p>

<p>(<i>A</i>). <i>Direct Ignition to Bismuth Oxid.</i>&mdash;This method was abandoned because
of the tendency to ignite suddenly during the incineration and the consequent
loss of material.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>). <i>The Method of the Japanese Pharmacopeia, Third Revised Edition,
Translated by the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.</i>&mdash;The method consists in
treatment of the product with nitric acid, evaporation and subsequent heating
to bismuth oxid. This method also was abandoned because of tendency toward
sudden ignition with loss of material.</p>

<p>(<i>C</i>). <i>The Method of Kollo (Apotheker Zeitung, 1910, p.&nbsp;99).</i>&mdash;The method
consists in decomposition of the product by heating on water bath with normal
sodium hydroxid solution, with formation of soluble sodium tri­brom­phenate
and insoluble bismuth hydroxid. The bismuth hydroxid is collected on a filter,
washed with hot water until a few drops of the filtrate no longer turn litmus
paper blue, dried and heated to constant weight and weighed as bismuth oxid.</p>

<p>(<i>D</i>). <i>A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Method (Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chem. Lab., 1911, p.&nbsp;18).</i>&mdash;This
method consists in dissolving the product in hot, strong hydrochloric acid,
diluting, filtering and precipitating by saturation with hydrogen sulphid. The
bismuth sulphid obtained is dissolved in nitric acid and from the solution
obtained the bismuth is precipitated by addition of an excess of ammonium
hydroxid and ammonium carbonate. The precipitate is collected and converted
to bismuth oxid by heat.</p>

<p>It is seen from the tabulation that the results obtained by the Kollo method
(Method C) are higher than those by the sulphid method (Method D) and that
duplicate determinations show a rather wide variation. The results by the
sulphid method are somewhat lower than those by the Kollo method, but duplicates
agree fairly well. In view of the fact that the Kollo method will give
excessive results if impurities such as talcum, etc., are present and in consideration
of the satisfactory results obtained in previous work with the
sulphid method, the figures obtained by this method are taken as indicative of
the bismuth content of the specimens examined. Calculating the per cent. of
bismuth oxid obtained to bismuth (Bi), the following values are obtained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bismuth Tri­brom­phenolate, Research Council Specimen: Bismuth, 44.8 per cent.<br />
Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck, Merck &amp; Co.: Bismuth, 46.6 per cent.<br />
Xeroform, Heyden Chemical Works: Bismuth, 60.7 per cent.</p></div>


<h5>TOTAL TRIBROMPHENOL</h5>

<p>The content of tri­brom­phenate radical, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-</sup>, was determined by the
method of Kollo (Apotheker Zeitung, 1910, p.&nbsp;99). It consists in titrating the
filtrate of the bismuth oxid determination of Kollo, described under “C” (bismuth
determinations), with normal hydrochloric acid, using phenol­phthalein as
an indicator. The cubic centimeters of normal alkali consumed multiplied by
the theoretical factor 0.331 gives the weight of tri­brom­phenol (combined and
free) contained in the specimen.</p>

<p>The following results were obtained:</p>

<h5>UNCOMBINED TRIBROMPHENOL</h5>

<p>The definite chemical formula given in New and Non­official Remedies for
bismuth tri­brom­phenate and the statement that it is “only slightly soluble in <span class="ell">..</span>.
alcohol&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” requires the absence of uncombined tri­brom­phenol, but
no method for its detection or determination is provided.</p>

<p>In the U.&nbsp;S. Patent 516,358 (expired March 13, 1911), issued to Bruno
Richard Seifert, assignor to Dr. F. Von Heyden, for “Phenol Bismuth Compound”
the freedom from uncombined tri­brom­phenol was provided for by the
direction to wash with alcohol the product obtained.</p>

<p>In the Swiss Pharmacopeia the permissible content of uncombined tri­brom­phenol
is limited thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="351"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If 0.5&nbsp;gm. be shaken with 5&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol and 1&nbsp;c.c. of the filtrate be diluted with 15&nbsp;c.c.
of water, neither a turbidity nor a flocculent precipitate should appear<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>When this test was applied to the three specimens under examination, the
Merck and Heyden specimens complied, while the Research Council specimen
did not comply, with this requirement.</p>

<p><i>Method 1.</i>&mdash;About 1&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate was placed in a flask,
20&nbsp;c.c. of 95 per cent. alcohol added and shaken for fifteen minutes, after
which it was filtered by suction through a Gooch filter into an Erlenmeyer flask.
The flask was rinsed with 10&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol and finally the filter was washed
with 10&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol, 25&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal sodium hydroxid solution were
added to the alcoholic filtrate (which was nearly but not perfectly clear) containing
the tri­brom­phenol, and the residual alkali titrated with tenth-normal
hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The number of cubic centimeters of tenth-normal alkali consumed multiplied
by 0.331 gave the weight of tri­brom­phenol (Table 3).</p>

<p><i>Method 2.</i>&mdash;About 2&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate were placed in a glass
stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, 100&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol were measured in and shaken
during one-half hour and allowed to stand over night. Fifty c.c. of the supernatant
liquid were then removed by means of a pipet, a slight excess of tenth-normal
sodium hydroxid added and the residual alkali titrated with tenth-normal
HCl.</p>

<p>This examination shows:</p>

<p>1. The Bismuth Tri­brom­phenolate submitted to the Council of National
Defense, does not correspond to the description of bismuth tri­brom­phenate in
New and Non­official Remedies.</p>

<p>2. As now supplied, Xeroform-Heyden does not meet the requirements for
bismuth tri­brom­phenate, nor does its composition correspond to that of the
product formerly supplied.</p>

<p>3. The description in New and Non­official Remedies of bismuth tri­brom­phenate
should provide an upper, as well as a lower, limit for the bismuth content;
it should provide tests for the absence of adulterants, and also set a limit
of permissible uncombined tri­brom­phenol.</p>


<h4>Report to Council of National Defense</h4>

<p>The results of this examination with reference to the Research Council
specimen having been submitted to the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,
this body advised the Medical Section of the Council of National Defense as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The specimen of “Bismuth Tri­brom­phenolate” sent to the Council of
National Defense complies with the New and Non­official Remedies description
for bismuth tri­brom­phenate, except that it contains considerable amounts
(approximately 16 per cent.) of alcohol-soluble, uncombined tri­brom­phenol.</p>


<h4>Revision of N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. Standards</h4>

<p>The results of the examination of the three specimens were sent to the
Heyden Chemical Works and to Merck and Co. (in each case disclosing the
identity of the particular firm’s product), asking aid in the standard­ization of
the product. After Merck and Co. had submitted valuable advice for a revision
of the somewhat loosely drawn standards for bismuth tri­brom­phenate in
N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1918, the inquiry whether the following proposed revision of the
description of bismuth tri­brom­phenate in New and Non­official Remedies was
acceptable, was submitted to both firms:</p>

<p><b>BISMUTH TRIBROMPHENATE.&mdash;&#8203;Bismuthi Tribromphenas.&mdash;&#8203;Bismuth
Tri­brom­phenol.&mdash;&#8203;Xeroform.</b>&mdash;&#8203;A basic bismuth tri­brom­phenate of variable composition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="353"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>An amorphous, yellow, nearly odorless and tasteless powder, neutral to moistened
litmus paper.</p>

<p>It is only slightly soluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, liquid petrolatum and vegetable
oils. Alkalies and strong acids decompose it. It is stable at temperatures below 120&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>When about 1&nbsp;gm. of the salt is boiled with 10&nbsp;c.c. of sodium hydroxide test solution,
the liquid filtered, and the filtrate acidulated with sulphuric acid, the white curdy precipitate
produced, when washed and dried, melts at 90 to 95&nbsp;C. (<i>tri­brom­phenol</i>). The contents
of the filter dissolve completely in dilute hydrochloric acid (insoluble <i>inert material</i>).</p>

<p>Boil 1&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate with 20&nbsp;c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of acetic
acid and distilled water, cool the solution and filter. Free the filtrate from bismuth by
the addition of hydrogen sulphide, boil the mixture and again filter. The latter filtrate
leaves not more than 0.005&nbsp;gm. of residue on evaporation and gentle ignition (<i>alkalies
and alkali earths</i>).</p>

<p>Shake for one minute in a separatory funnel, 2&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate, 20&nbsp;c.c.
of ether, and 20&nbsp;c.c. of a mixture of equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and distilled water.
Draw off the aqueous portion and concentrate to about 4&nbsp;c.c.; pour it into 100&nbsp;c.c. distilled
water, filter, evaporate the filtrate on the water bath to 30&nbsp;c.c., again filter and divide
this filtrate into portions of 5&nbsp;c.c. each. Mix one portion with an equal volume of dilute
sulphuric acid; it does not become cloudy (<i>lead</i>). Treat another portion with a slight
excess of ammonia water; the supernatant liquid does not exhibit a bluish tint (<i>copper</i>).
Another portion is not immediately affected by barium nitrate test solution (<i>sulphate</i>).</p>

<p>Heat gently a mixture of about 0.2&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate with 5&nbsp;c.c. of potassium
hydroxide test solution and about 0.2&nbsp;gm. of aluminum wire; the vapors evolved do
not turn red litmus blue (<i>nitrates</i>).</p>

<p>Shake 1&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate frequently during fifteen minutes with 30&nbsp;c.c.
of alcohol (95 per cent.), filter and rinse flask with two separate 10&nbsp;c.c. portions of alcohol,
allowing the washings to run through filter. To the combined filtrate and washings add
20&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal sodium hydroxide and a few drops of phenol­phthalein solution
and determine the excess of alkali with tenth-normal hydrochloric acid. Not more than 1&nbsp;c.c.
of tenth-normal sodium hydroxide should have been consumed by the alcoholic liquid
(<i>free tri­brom­phenol</i>).</p>

<p>Add 2&nbsp;c.c. of nitric acid to 2&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate in a porcelain crucible,
carefully evaporate to dryness on a sand bath and incinerate. Dissolve the residue in 5&nbsp;c.c.
of concentrated hydrochloric acid and add to the solution 10&nbsp;c.c. of a saturated solution
of stannous chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture should not
darken on standing thirty minutes (<i>arsenic</i>).</p>

<p>Mix 0.5&nbsp;gm. of the salt with 10&nbsp;c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of hydrochloric acid,
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., and distilled water. No effervescence should occur (<i>carbonate</i>).</p>

<p>To about 0.5&nbsp;gm. of bismuth tri­brom­phenate, accurately weighed, add 20&nbsp;c.c. of hydrochloric
acid and digest on water bath. Add 150&nbsp;c.c. of distilled water and filter. Rinse
the beaker with 30&nbsp;c.c. of distilled water and allow the washings to run through the filter.
Saturate the combined filtrate and washings with hydrogen sulphide, filter off the bismuth
sulphide, wash and dissolve in hot dilute nitric acid. Add a slight excess of ammonia
water followed by 2&nbsp;c.c. of ammonium carbonate test solution. Allow to stand thirty
minutes, filter off the precipitated bismuth hydroxide and heat to constant weight at dull
red heat. The residue of bismuth oxide (Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) should not be less than 45 per cent. nor
more than 55 per cent. of the original weight of bismuth tri­brom­phenate taken, corresponding
to not less than 40 per cent. nor more than 49 per cent. of bismuth.</p></div>

<p>The Heyden Chemical Works accepted the proposed monograph. Regarding
the Laboratory’s findings, the firm stated that “the product had to be made
in this country after importations from Europe became impossible and the first
lots were not fully up to the standard.” Later the firm stated that it could
furnish a product which it considered equal to that which was previously
imported and offered to submit “samples of the new material.”</p>

<p>Merck and Co. acknowledged the receipt of the monograph but made no
statement as to its acceptance or suggestions for its revision. As the new
monograph was accepted by the Heyden Chemical Works and as Merck and
Co. offered no objections, it was adopted for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1919, by the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry.</p>

<p>In November, 1918, Merck and Co. sent a specimen labeled “Bismuth Tri­brom­phenate-Merck,”
“Merck and Co., New York, Distributors and Guarantors”
and wrote: “You will notice this sample conforms in nearly all details
to the tests submitted with our letter of June 4. We have been able to produce
better goods, but just at present unsatisfactory starting material confronts
us.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="354"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a></span></p>
<p>Examination of the specimen demonstrated that it was soluble to a considerable
extent in alcohol (the N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1918, description provides that it
should be only slightly soluble in alcohol) and, according to the standards
adopted for New and Non­official Remedies, 1919, contained 18 per cent. of
uncombined tri­brom­phenol (more than five times the permitted amount).</p>

<p>In December, 1918, Merck and Co. submitted another specimen and said:
“We believe this is a better grade than we have been able to make in the
recent past. It seems to meet all the tests for N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R., 1919, with two exceptions:
these are (a) solubility in alcohol, and (b) the test for uncombined tribromphenol.{”}</p>

<p>When the two recent samples of bismuth tri­brom­phenate-Merck and two
samples of Xeroform-Heyden were examined according to the new monograph
the results given in Table 8 were obtained.</p>

<p>In view of the laboratory’s report the referee of the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry in charge of bismuth tri­brom­phenate recommended that the
acceptance of Xeroform-Heyden and bismuth tri­brom­phenate-Merck be withdrawn,
but that this should be without prejudice to their reinstatement when
satisfactory products are again offered for sale. The Council adopted the
recommendation of the referee and accordingly Xeroform-Heyden and bismuth
tri­brom­phenate-Merck are omitted from New and Non­official Remedies, 1919.</p>

<p>When the laboratory’s findings with regard to Xeroform-Heyden and the
action of the Council deleting the article from New and Non­official Remedies
was reported to the Heyden Chemical Works, the firm expressed regret that
efforts to produce a product equal to that formerly obtained from Germany
had so far not been successful and announced that it had decided to withdraw
Xeroform-Heyden from the market for the present. When Merck and Co.
was advised in regard to the report of the laboratory and Council’s action,
this firm questioned the feasibility of producing a product meeting the Council’s
standards and suggested that the test for free tri­brom­phenol be revised to
permit as much as 15 per cent. of this constituent. When Merck and Co. was
reminded that its product submitted in 1915 essentially complied with the
adopted standards (an old sample of Xeroform-Heyden was also found to
comply) and that the estimate of the therapeutic value of bismuth tri­brom­phenate
is based on a product essentially devoid of free tri­brom­phenol, the
firm replied:</p>

<p>“As stated in our letter of the 12th inst., we do not wish to market the
chemical unless it meets all legitimate requirements of the physicians that use
it. If, therefore, your standard proves to be good and it is commercially possible
to make supplies conforming to it, we shall do so. We shall discontinue
the article unless it is of suitable quality.”&mdash;(<i>From Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical
Laboratory, 1918, p.&nbsp;93.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE STANDARDIZATION OF PROCAIN AND EXAMINATION
OF THE MARKET SUPPLY</h3>


<p>Procain, which chemically is the mono-hydrochlorid of para-amino-benzoyl­diethyl-amino-ethanol,
is the nonproprietary name selected by the Federal
Trade Commission as the official designation for the drug previously known
under the proprietary name “novocaine.” Before the war procain was obtainable
in this country only through the Farbwerke Hoechst Co., the American
representative of the German establishment, Farbwerke, vorm, Meister, Lucius
and Bruening, under the name “novocaine.” This monopoly on “novocaine”
was exercised by virtue of United States patent No. 812554, which was issued
to Alfred Einhorn, Munich, Germany, assignor to Farbwerke, vorm, Meister,
Lucius and Bruening, Hoechst a. M., in 1906. With the outbreak of hostilities,
Congress passed the Trading with the Enemy Act, and under this, the Federal
Trade Commission took charge of the novocain patent with a view of securing
the production of this product in the United States. To ensure an adequate
supply of the drug, the Federal Trade Commission on recommendation of the
Committee on Synthetic Drugs of the National Research Council, in addition
to issuing a license to the Farbwerke Hoechst Company (which license
was later transferred to the H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories) granted authority to
the Abbott Laboratories and the Rector Chemical Company to manufacture it
under the U.&nbsp;S. patent after specimens submitted by these firms had been
found satisfactory in the Association’s laboratory and at the Cornell Pharmacologic
Laboratory.</p>

<p>When the first specimen of American made procain was sent to the American
Medical Association Chemical Laboratory it was necessary to work out
adequate standards. The standards were formulated on the basis of the novocain
monograph in the German Pharmacopeia, 1910, Ed.&nbsp;5, p.&nbsp;363, Remedia
“Hoechst,” p.&nbsp;242, and New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, p.&nbsp;32, and the work
carried out in this laboratory.</p>

<p>The following description has been adopted for New and Non­official Remedies,
1919, and all specimens of procain were subjected to these tests:</p>

<p>Procain occurs in small colorless and odorless crystals, or a crystalline
powder which if placed on the tongue produces a transient sense of numbness.</p>

<p>It melts at 153–155&nbsp;C.<a name="FNanchor_212_220" id="FNanchor_212_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_220" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>One gm. of procain is soluble in 0.7&nbsp;c.c. of water and in 20&nbsp;c.c. of alcohol
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. (95 per cent.) at 20&nbsp;C. From the aqueous solution, which is neutral,
alkali hydroxids and carbonates precipitate the free base in the form of a
colorless oil, which soon congeals to a crystalline mass, but solutions of sodium
bicarbonate are miscible with solutions of procain without producing precipitations
or turbidity.</p>

<p>Dissolve 1&nbsp;gm. of procain in water. Separate portions of the solution yield
a white precipitate with potassium mercuric iodid solution, a white precipitate
with mercuric chlorid test solution, a brown precipitate with iodin test solution
and a yellow precipitate with picric acid test solution. Acidify a portion with
dilute nitric acid. A white curdy precipitate is thrown down on the addition
of silver nitrate test solution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="356"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a></span></p>
<p>Dissolve about 0.1&nbsp;gm. of procain in 5&nbsp;c.c. of water, add 2 drops of dilute
hydrochloric acid and 2 drops of sodium nitrite solution (10 per cent.) and
mix with a solution of 0.2&nbsp;gm. of betanaphthol in 10&nbsp;c.c. of sodium hydroxid
solution (10 per cent.). A scarlet red precipitate is thrown down.</p>

<p>To a solution of about 0.1&nbsp;gm. of procain in 5&nbsp;c.c. of water add 3 drops of
dilute sulphuric acid and mix with 5 drops of potassium permanganate test
solution. The violet color of the latter disappears immediately (distinction
from cocain).</p>

<p>Dissolve about 0.1&nbsp;gm. procain in 1&nbsp;c.c. sulphuric acid U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. The solution
is colorless (organic impurities).</p>

<p>Dissolve 0.1&nbsp;gm. of the salt in 10&nbsp;c.c. of water and saturate with hydrogen
sulphid. No coloration or precipitation occurs (salts of the heavy metals).</p>

<p>Incinerate about 0.5&nbsp;gm. of procain accurately weighed. Not more than
0.1 per cent. of residue remains.</p>

<p>To obtain specimens representing the market supply, orders for the three
brands of procain were placed with pharmaceutical firms in New York, Baltimore
and San Francisco. The Baltimore and San Francisco firms supplied
specimens of procain-novocain brand and procain-Rector brand but reported
that the Abbott brand was not procurable. The New York correspondent was
able to supply procain-Rector only. As the entire output of the Abbott Laboratories
was stated to go to the government, specimens of this product were
obtained through the surgeon-general of the army from the general purchasing
office, Medical Dept., U.&nbsp;S. Army. The following specimens were obtained
and examined:</p>

<p><i>1. Procain-Abbott, 6 specimens:</i> The first specimen bore no serial number
but the five later specimens were designated respectively, No. 89999, No. 89998,
No. 89997, No. 89996, and No. 810995, representing batches from which shipments
are to be made on contracts placed by the general purchasing office, Medical
Department, U.&nbsp;S. Army, with the Abbott Laboratories of Chicago.</p>

<p><i>2. Procain-novocain brand, 4 specimens:</i> These were designated respectively,
A56, A57, A63, and A67. The first two specimens were labeled “Manufactured
by the Farbwerke-Hoechst Co. at the H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories.” The third
specimen (not in original container) was labeled “H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories”
and the fourth was marked “Manufactured by the H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories.”</p>

<p><i>3. Procain-Rector, 3 specimens:</i> Each bore the statement “Manufactured by
the Rector Chemical Company” but had no “lot number.”</p>

<p>From this examination it appears that all the specimens of procain received
complied satisfactorily with all tests of identity and purity with the following
exceptions: (1) One specimen of procain-Abbott had a melting point slightly
below the permitted range; however, the last five specimens had the required
melting point. (2) Five specimens of procain-Abbott and the last three specimens
of procain-Rector were not entirely colorless, but had a yellow or light
brown tinge.</p>

<p>The toxicity experiments, which were carried out by Dr. R.&nbsp;A. Hatcher of
the Cornell Pharmacologic Laboratory, were reported as being satisfactory.</p>

<p>When the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry referred the matter of the
discolored specimens of procain to the Rector Chemical Company for explanation,
the firm wrote that for a short time for some unexplainable reason its
procain had been slightly yellowish in color, but that every batch had been
carefully tested and found to answer all chemical requirements. The firm stated
that the product which it had sent out for some time past had been white and
yielded a colorless solution.</p>

<p>To a like inquiry from the Council the Abbott Laboratories replied that the
five samples which were found discolored were products manufactured by the
<span class="pagenum" title="357"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a></span>Rector Chemical Company and represented goods which it had purchased to
assist in filling delayed orders, because the firm had found itself unable to
keep pace with the demand on account of delay in securing needed apparatus.
The firm submitted protocols to show that the procain made by it, by Rector
and by Metz were of equal toxicity.</p>

<p>In the accompanying table the results of the examination are given. For
comparison the findings for the specimens examined previously are included.</p>

<p>So far as the evidence goes, there was nothing to indicate that the yellowish
or brownish colored specimens of procain were seriously impure. On the contrary,
the compliance with the chemical and toxicologic tests indicated that the
color was due to an insignificant trace of some colored substance produced in
the manufacturing process. In view of this, the Council considered the use of
the discolored product to be justified in the present emergency, although it
urged that the future supply of procain should be free from color and also
comply to the tests of purity. It made this request in the interest of the medical
and dental professions, which use the drug, and also in a desire that in the
manufacture of synthetic drugs, the United States should occupy a high place.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>DETERIORATION OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE
SOLUTIONS (“Chlorinated Soda” Solutions)</h3>


<p>The following note on two hypochlorite solutions is published as a slight
addition to the inconclusive available information concerning the rate of
deterioration of solutions containing sodium hypochlorite:</p>

<p><b>Hyclorite.</b>&mdash;This is a solution of chlorinated soda, 100&nbsp;gm. of which is said
to contain sodium hypochlorite 4.05&nbsp;gm., sodium chlorid 3.20&nbsp;gm., calcium
hydroxid 0.25&nbsp;gm., inert ingredients 0.92&nbsp;gm. It is declared to contain, when
placed on the market, not less than 3.85 per cent. of available chlorin, and to
deteriorate at the rate of about 12 per cent. per year. In order that the available
chlorin content at the time of use may be judged, the date of bottling is
stamped on each package. The solution is prepared by decomposing chlorinated
lime suspended in water with sodium carbonate and adding to the solution
obtained a freshly prepared solution of electrolyzed sodium chlorid. The composition
and keeping qualities of hyclorite were reported on by this laboratory
(Ann. Rep. Chem. Lab., A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. <b>9</b>:123, 1916). Hyclorite is fully described
in New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, p.&nbsp;153.</p>

<p>To further check the keeping qualities of hyclorite, a specimen received
from the manufacturer in June, 1918, and said to have been bottled in April,
1918, was examined in September, 1918. It was found to contain 3.6 per cent,
“available chlorin” (equivalent to 3.79&nbsp;gm. sodium hypochlorite in 100 gm.).
This indicated a loss of 6.2 per cent. during five months (equivalent to 14.9 per
cent. per year) on the assumption that it contained the amount of “available
chlorin” declared on the label.</p>

<p><b>Concentrated Solution Sodium Hypochlorite-Mulford.</b>&mdash;This is described as
a 5 per cent, aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite containing free chlorin
equivalent to from 0.2 to 1 per cent. sodium hypochlorite. It is prepared by
treating a solution of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate with chlorinated
lime. The solution is filtered and standardized by determining the “available
chlorin” and adjusting it to contain the equivalent of 5 per cent. of sodium
hypochlorite.</p>

<p>It is proposed for use in the irrigation treatment of infected wounds after
dilution with nine times its volume of water and the addition of a determined
amount (stated on the label of each bottle) of boric acid to render it neutral
to phenol­phthalein. The manufacturer has found that development of a red
color (due to formation of permanganate from the manganese contained in
the chlorinated lime) is indicative of deterioration, and therefore warns against
any solution which has become pink.</p>

<p>A specimen of concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite-Mulford was
sent the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry in June, 1917, with a view of
having the product admitted to New and Non­official Remedies. At that time
it was found to contain 4.18 per cent. “available chlorin” (equivalent to 4.4&nbsp;gm.
sodium hypochlorite in 100 gm.). Another specimen received at the same time
and kept unopened in a dark place, was examined in September, 1918, and was
found to contain 2.88 per cent. available chlorin (equivalent to 3&nbsp;gm. sodium
hypochlorite per 100 gm.). On the assumption that the second specimen contained,
at the time of its receipt, the amount of “available chlorin” found in
the first, this second specimen lost 31 per cent. of its “available chlorin” during
fifteen months.</p>

<p>At the time the specimens were received from the Mulford Company, the
firm reported experiments which were under way to determine the keeping
qualities of the solution. These experiments indicated marked deterioration
of the specimens, which had become red from permanganate formation, and
also that one specimen, which had not become red, had lost 5 per cent. of its
available chlorin in one month. The Mulford Company explained that when
<span class="pagenum" title="359"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a></span>sufficient data had been accumulated, a decision would be made either as to
placing a time limit on the solution or making a claim as to the rate of deterioration.
When the extreme deterioration found by this laboratory was
reported to the Mulford Company, the firm replied that this was a much greater
loss than the average deterioration found in its chemical laboratory, namely,
an average of 10 or 12 per cent. per year. It advised that because of the
instability of concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite, its manufacture had
been discontinued.&mdash;(<i>From Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory, 1918, p.&nbsp;81.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>SYPHILODOL</h3>


<p>The shortage of arsphenamin (salvarsan) has made the sale of substitutes
a profitable business. In many of these substitutes the earmarks of dishonesty
have been obvious, so that detection of their falsity was relatively simple. In
the case of “Syphilodol” marketed by the French Medicinal Company, Inc.,
New York, the deception has been practiced more skilfully. In the circular
announcing their preparations, we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It seems fitting at this time, when the American physicians are doing so much for France,
that there should be a reciprocation in some way.</p>

<p>“Attempting to enhance somewhat this mutual interchange, we are presenting some of
those scientific products, which have been so successfully used in France, &mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The effect of <span class="lowercase smcap">SYPHILODOL</span> is very similar to salvarsan and neosalvarsan, but it has the
advantage of being more lasting in its results and more pleasing in the manner of its preparations,
in that it is put up in the form of tablets, and, also, in hermetically closed glass
syringes or ampules, so that it may be administered either by the mouth, intravenously or
intramuscularly, at the discretion of the physician. Patients averse to the use of the hypodermic
needle may be treated expeditiously by the use of the tablet form of the medicine.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to Syphilodol, the French Medicinal Co. also sells “Vichi Fruti,”
a combination of salts, “Urodol,” an “alkaline salt of the famous European
Springs which is noted for breaking up and dissolving uric acid rapidly” and
“Syloiodol,” “French Preventive,” which is described as “a solution of iodol
incorporated into bougie.”</p>

<p>“Syphilodol,” we are told, is “a synthetic chemical product of <i>silver</i>, <i>arsenic</i>
and <i>antimony</i>, scientifically prepared after the formula of the <i>late</i> Dr. Alfred
Fournier of Paris.” (Italics ours&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>). It is also claimed that “Prof.
Metchnikoff and other noted French scientists have made exhaustive tests of
syphilodol and found it superior to the other products, in the treatment of
syphilis.” In the advertisements, Fournier and Metchnikoff are the only names
given of alleged endorsers; both of these men are dead and cannot protest.
True, Fournier did considerable work on a legitimate synthetic of antimony,
silver and arsenic having a general chemical constitution similar to arsphenamin,
but so far as we are aware, there has been no publication by these men
on “Syphilodol.” It would seem that the valuable work and high reputation
of Fournier and Metchnikoff are being capitalized by the French Medicinal
Company in their endeavor to foist a nostrum on the medical profession of
this country.</p>

<p>“Syphilodol” comes in two forms&mdash;ampules and tablets. An order for two
0.4 ampules brought an elaborate case, much like those used to hold the
popular style safety razors. The ampule itself was a “classy” affair evidently
made by a glass expert; the hypodermic needle was enclosed in a novel sealed
glass device. The price of each ampule is $3. No such fancy garnishments
came with the tablets, although they are listed at $4.50 for twenty-five&mdash;18 cents
a tablet! In the “Syphilodol” advertising it is emphasized that both the tablets
and ampules are to be administered. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Syphilodol is dispensed in the form of tablets and also hermetically closed glass syringes
or ampules so that it may be used either by the mouth, intravenously or intramuscularly at
the discretion of the physician. An advantage of the tablets is that they can and should be
given during the interim between the injections.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="360"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a></span></p>

<h5>LABORATORY REPORT ON SYPHILODOL</h5>

<p>Several samples of “Syphilodol” were sent to the American Medical Association
Chemical Laboratory by readers of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. An original bottle of
tablets was ordered direct from the French Medicinal Company. The bottle
contained 25 yellow tablets, having an average weight of 0.276&nbsp;gm. (4<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grains).
After being powdered, “Syphilodol” was found to be only partially soluble in
water (the excipient is soluble) and to be neutral in reaction. These findings
contradict the claims on the circular accompanying the bottle to the effect that
“Syphilodol is a yellow powder, soluble in water, and has an acid reaction.”
Qualitative tests indicated the presence of mercury, sucrose (cane sugar),
iodid, calcium, sulphate, fatty material, a trace of silver, a trace of arsenic and
a very minute trace of antimony; a red dye was also present. Both qualitative
and quantitative data showed that the mercury was present in the form of mercurous
iodid (yellow iodid of mercury&mdash;hydrargyri iodidum flavum). Quantitative
estimations yielded the following:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Silver (Ag<sup>+</sup>)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">0.001&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Mercury (Hg<sup>+</sup>)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;11.1&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Iodid (I<sup>-</sup>)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;&#8199;7.8&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Sucrose (cane sugar)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;72.0&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Ash (calcium sulphate)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;&#8199;2.5&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Ether-soluble material (fatty material&mdash;petrolatum)</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;&#8199;3.5&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per&nbsp;cent.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus each tablet of “Syphilodol” contains approximately, <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain of mercurous
iodid. An ampule of “Syphilodol,” labeled 0.4 gram, contained approximately
1.5&nbsp;c.c. of a liquid which after evaporation on a water-bath left a
residue weighing 0.8&nbsp;mg., or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>80</sub></span> grain. A second ampule held about 2&nbsp;c.c. of
liquid, which contained a trace of arsenic (less than 0.00001&nbsp;gm., or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6000</sub></span> grain);
a very small amount of mercury was indicated but not definitely established.
The liquid had the physical characteristics of water.</p>

<p>Accompanying “Syphilodol” advertising sent to physicians is a circular letter
inviting the doctor to become a member in the “United States Bacteriological
and Research Institute.” The “institute” seems to be a means of suggesting
that the physician have bacteriologic, pathologic and serologic examinations
made on behalf of his patients. In view of the fact that it is to the
commercial interest of the French Medicinal Company to have as many users
of “Syphilodol” as possible, it would be interesting to know what proportion
of the Wassermann tests are reported negative.</p>

<p>Shorn of its mystery, Syphilodol the “synthetic chemical product of silver,
arsenic and antimony” is essentially mercurous iodid&mdash;yellow iodid of mercury.</p>

sulphate. As the advertising matter for “Syphilodol” referred to the synthetic
compound of silver, antimony and arsenic, and also to its use in syphilis
by Fournier, the above compound was first suspected. However, the general
characteristics of syphilodol tablets, such as partial solubility in water, but not
soluble in sodium hydroxid, sodium bicarbonate or acids, threw doubt on the
hypothesis. When a small amount of the powdered tablets was treated with
water, a yellow residue could be filtered off; the filtrate was pink, opalescent,
which on standing gave a clear pink solution, and a small yellow precipitate.
The residue, when allowed to remain in sulphuric acid solution (20 per cent.)
<span class="pagenum" title="361"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a></span>over night became red; on boiling, the red precipitate with sulphuric acid, the
precipitate volatilized and could be condensed in a watch glass. Adding a
pinch of manganese dioxid to the hot sulphuric acid mixture caused an evolution
of iodin fumes. A small amount of powdered syphilodol tablets was placed
in the sunlight; they turned from yellow to black. All these reactions are
typical of mercurous iodid&mdash;yellow iodid of mercury.</p>


<h5>MERCURY, SILVER, ARSENIC, ANTIMONY</h5>

<p>I. <i>Mercury.</i>&mdash;Two methods were used to determine the mercury: (<i>a</i>) 1.4535&nbsp;gm.
of powdered syphilodol was treated with 10&nbsp;c.c. of a 50 per cent. sodium
sulphid solution. The solution was then transferred with washings (about
20&nbsp;c.c.) to a cathode cup, previously weighed with its contained mercury. The
mercury compound was electrolyzed by a current of about 8 volts and 3 amperes,
using a rotating anode. The solution (and some sulphur suspension) was
removed by siphon, pouring in water until the amperage of the current was
close to zero (U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., IX, p.&nbsp;587). The increased weight in mercury was
0.1612&nbsp;gm.</p>

<p>II. To serve as a check on the foregoing method, mercury was also determined
in the following method, which also allowed systematic tests for silver,
antimony and arsenic. (<i>b</i>) 1.1023&nbsp;gm. of the sample was placed in an Erlenmeyer
flask, 50&nbsp;c.c. of water, 50&nbsp;c.c. of sodium hydroxid solution (10 per cent.)
and 20&nbsp;c.c. of formaldehyd solution, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., added. The solution was boiled
for ten minutes and maintained at temperature of steam bath for two hours.
(This reduces the mercury salt to mercury and any silver salt to silver; antimony
would probably be likewise reduced.) The precipitated mercury was
transferred by water, and concentrated nitric acid added. (The nitric acid
solution is boiled to oxidize all mercurous nitrate to mercuric nitrate.) A small
white precipitate was obtained at this point which seemed to be insoluble in
aqua regia (calcium sulphate). The filtrate from this precipitate, which was
washed well, was tested with one or two drops of dilute hydrochloric acid and
a faint precipitate formed; this was filtered off through extra fine filter paper
and washed repeatedly. The paper and precipitate was heated with potassium
cyanid solution over night, filtered and the filtrate electrolyzed in a platinum
dish. The increase in weight of the dish was 0.00018&nbsp;gm., or 0.001 per cent.
Into the platinum dish some nitric acid was poured, then diluted, and a drop
of hydrochloric acid added. A turbidity was produced which cleared on the
addition of excess of ammonium hydroxid solution (<i>silver</i>). The filtrate from
the nitric acid treatment was electrolyzed, this time in a platinum dish, and the
liquid carefully removed, washed carefully with redistilled alcohol and ether.
The mercury, which could be seen easily by the naked eye, weighed 0.1200&nbsp;gm.,
equivalent to 10.89 per cent. of mercury.</p>

<p>III. <i>Arsenic and Antimony.</i>&mdash;About 3&nbsp;gm. of the powdered specimen was
digested with sulphuric acid in a Kjeldahl flask. One-half portion (which was
evaporated almost to dryness and treated with 5&nbsp;c.c. of concentrated hydrochloric
acid) was submitted to treatment with hydrogen sulphid, diluted, and
saturated with hydrogen sulphid. The precipitate was treated in the usual manner
of the group separation with warm ammonium sulphid solution. The filtrate
from this treatment was acidulated with hydrochloric acid, the precipitate
removed, and treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The substance
insoluble in hydrochloric acid was treated with more concentrated hydrochloric
acid and a crystal of potassium chlorate. The solution was tested after the
Gutzeit method of the Pharmacopeia IX, for <i>arsenic</i>. A very small amount
was indicated. The hydrogen sulphid test was not indicative. The solution
which might contain the <i>antimony</i> was tested with hydrogen sulphid. In one
case only was a slight orange coloration produced. No antimony was deposited
<span class="pagenum" title="362"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></span>on platinum foil in the presence of granulated zinc. These tests were run in
triplicate.</p>

<p><i>Iodid.</i>&mdash;Iodid was determined by the Carius method (<i>a</i>) 0.7412&nbsp;gm. yielded
0.1112&nbsp;gm. silver iodid, equivalent to 8.09 per cent.; (<i>b</i>) 0.5319&nbsp;gm. yielded
0.0751&nbsp;gm., equivalent to 7.80 per cent. The iodid and mercury were in proportions
comparable to mercurous iodid.</p>

<p><i>Ash.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) 0.9159&nbsp;gm. when ignited to constant weight yielded 0.0232&nbsp;gm.,
equivalent to 2.52 per cent. ash; (<i>b</i>) 1.3008&nbsp;gm. treated with water and the
residue filtered on a Gooch filter and ignited. The ash of the residue was 2.51
per cent. (the mercurous iodid volatilized). The ash was calcium sulphate.</p>

<p><i>Sucrose.</i>&mdash;1.3008&nbsp;gm. of the sample was treated with water and filtered by
suction through a Gooch crucible. The filtrate and washing were carefully
transferred to 500&nbsp;c.c. volumetric flask, and allowed to stand one week; 50&nbsp;c.c.
portions were used to determine sugar according to the Daufresne-O’Sullivan
method. The weights of cupric oxid averaged 210&nbsp;mg., or 72 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Ether Soluble Material.</i>&mdash;1.6998&nbsp;gm. of the powdered specimen was extracted
with ether and the ether extract evaporated to dryness. The residue weighed
0.0600&nbsp;gm., equivalent to 3.53 per cent.</p>


<h5>SYPHILODOL AMPULES</h5>

<p><i>Water.</i>&mdash;The liquid from one ampule was distilled over very carefully. The
freezing point of the liquid was +0.1&nbsp;C., and it was neutral to methyl orange
and phenol­phthalein.</p>

<p><i>Arsenic.</i>&mdash;The contents of one ampule was placed in a small florence flask,
20&nbsp;c.c. of concentrated sulphuric acid added and heated to 70&nbsp;C.; 0.5&nbsp;gm. of
potassium permanganate was added in small amounts. The procedure was then
carried on as described by Engelhardt and Winters in <i>J. Am. Pharm. Assn.</i>,
1915, p.&nbsp;1469. To the mixture from 5 to 10&nbsp;c.c. of hydrogen peroxid solution
were added drop by drop until the color had disappeared. The liquid was
diluted with 20&nbsp;c.c. of water, boiled fifteen minutes, diluted again and boiled
fifteen minutes, then cooled and made up to exactly 100&nbsp;c.c. A blank was also
run alongside. Five c.c. of this solution was then tested quantitatively for
arsenic according to the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. IX method, using all precautions. Comparisons
of stains showed less than 0.00001&nbsp;gm. of arsenic (As).&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 18, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>CERELENE</h3>


<p>Cerelene, a paraffin preparation for the treatment of burns, was submitted
to the Council by the Holliday Laboratories, with the statement that it was
composed of 84 per cent. paraffin, 15 per cent. myricyl palmitate, and 1 per
cent. purified elemi gum to which is added oil of eucalyptus 2 per cent. and
betanaphthol 0.25 per cent. It was explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Myricyl Palmitate is a purified form of Beeswax, free from all impurities,
acids, etc., which is solely manufactured by this Company<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>It was also stated that on “special order” Cerelene has been made containing
oil of eucalyptus and resorcin, oil of eucalyptus and picric acid, and picric acid
alone. The following report on the preparation was presented to the Council
by the referee to whom Cerelene had been assigned:</p>

<p>Cerelene is another compound wax for the treatment of burns. According
to the work of Sollmann (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. <b>68</b>:1799, 1917) it is highly improbable
that compound mixtures have any advantage over simple paraffin of low melting
point. Cerelene must therefore be considered as an unessential modification
of paraffin, and as in conflict with Rule 10, unless definite evidence of
<span class="pagenum" title="363"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a></span>superiority be submitted. Cerelene mixtures containing medicinal ingredients
also appear unscientific since the evidence that the ingredients do not leave
the wax has not been successfully contradicted. Finally, the claims made for
Cerelene are rather extreme, and would need some revision before they could
be accepted.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory reports:</p>

<p>The physical properties of Cerelene are as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Melting point by U. S. P. method</span></div></td><td class="tal">50.0 C.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Ductility limit</span></div></td><td class="tal">30.5 C.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Plasticity limit</span></div></td><td class="tal">26.4 C.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Not strong at</span></div></td><td class="tal">38.0 C.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Adheres moderately well; detaches with “pulling.” On heating,
readily loses eucalyptol, and a small amount of resinous substance
forms in the bottom of the beaker. If Cerelene be heated to 145&nbsp;C.
and cooled, the resulting product no longer has the properties of the
original Cerelene.</p>

<p>After two years’ delay on the part of the manufacturer, the Council authorized
publication declaring Cerelene inadmissible for New and Non­official
Remedies because its superiority over single paraffins had not been demonstrated
and the unwarranted claims had not been abandoned.&mdash;(<i>Abstracted from

<h3>DR. DE SANCTIS’ RHEUMATIC AND GOUT PILLS</h3>


<p>Dr. DeSanctis’ Rheumatic and Gout Pills are sold by Edward Cleaver, 13
Clerkenwell Road, London, England. The American agents are E. Fougera
and Co., Inc., New York. The package is a round pill box and contains twelve
pills and a circular, which directs that one pill be taken every eight hours until
relieved. In the package there is also a circular advertising Dr. DeSanctis’
Gout and Rheumatic Paint, with directions for its use. On the cover of a
box, which contained six of the retail packages, is the statement that these pills
have been in general use for nearly 100 years, and that their sale has been
built up without advertising.</p>

<p>DeSanctis’ pills are round, uncoated, and have a light brown color. There
was some variation in the color of different lots, one lot in particular being
gray rather than brown. A little arrowroot starch was found in each box, this
evidently having been used as a dusting powder. The pills were very hard,
rather brittle, but quite difficult to powder. The pills were not readily disintegrated
by water or diluted acids, even when warmed, but when warmed
with a dilute sodium hydroxid solution they readily disintegrated.</p>

<p>Ten pills weighed 3.213&nbsp;gm., an average of 0.3213&nbsp;gm., or 5 grains. The
arrowroot starch used as a dusting powder was removed as completely as possible
by rolling the pills in a cloth. Several dozen pills were then powdered
and the powder thus obtained used for the analysis.</p>

<p>A microscopic examination of the powder showed powdered colchicum seed
in abundance and also traces of arrowroot starch, no doubt from that used as
the dusting powder.</p>

<p>Since colchicum seed was so abundant, the powder was assayed by the
U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeial method for colchicum seed (U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. IX, p.&nbsp;120), slightly
modified so that less of the powdered pills than directed there could be used.
In one assay 3.75&nbsp;gm. gave 0.0204&nbsp;gm. of colchicin or 0.54 per cent. In a
duplicate, 5&nbsp;gm. gave 0.0234&nbsp;gm. of colchicin or 0.47 per cent.; average 0.5
per cent.</p>

<p>The alkaloid obtained had the characteristic appearance and odor of colchicin
when separated from the seed under these conditions. The solution in
<span class="pagenum" title="364"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a></span>water and acid was yellow; the aqueous solution was intensely bitter, and the
yellow color intensified with acids. The dry residue became intensely yellow
with concentrated sulphuric acid; with nitric acid it became violet turning to
yellow, and with concentrated sulphuric acid and potassium nitrate it gave a
yellowish green color, turning to violet and finally to a wine color. All these
reactions are typical of colchicin.</p>

<p>From 1&nbsp;gm. of the powdered pills there was obtained 0.0425&nbsp;gm. of ash, or
4.25 per cent.</p>

<p>When the powdered pills were extracted with chloroform in a Soxhlet
apparatus, a very uniform quantity of extract was obtained. From 5&nbsp;gm. there
was obtained, in one case, 0.581&nbsp;gm.; in another, 0.5755&nbsp;gm., and in a third,
0.588&nbsp;gm., the average being 0.5815&nbsp;gm. or 11.63 per cent.</p>

<p>On still further extracting with alcohol, a small amount of extractive was
obtained, the amount depending on the length of time the extraction was
continued.</p>

<p>On extracting with hot water the residue left after exhaustion with chloroform
and with alcohol, a further extract was obtained. In one case, it amounted
to 0.4763&nbsp;gm. or 9.53 per cent., and in another case it amounted to 0.470&nbsp;gm.,
or 9.40 per cent.; average 9.47 per cent.</p>

<p>In attempting to dry the pills or the above-mentioned chloroformic extract
at 100&nbsp;C., a crystalline sublimate was obtained which had the odor of benzoic
acid. The crystals were acid, their neutral solution gave a flesh-colored precipitate
with ferric chlorid, and they melted at 120–121&nbsp;C. This crystalline
substance appeared to be benzoic acid.</p>

<p>The quantity of benzoic acid in this extract was determined by heating it
to about 140&nbsp;C. A current of air was drawn through the flask and the sublimed
benzoic acid collected in a cooled tube. The benzoic acid was washed out of the
tube with neutral alcohol, and the solution was titrated with tenth normal potassium
hydroxid. In one case, 11.25&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal alkali was used, indicating
0.1373&nbsp;gm, of benzoic acid; in another, 12.27&nbsp;c.c., indicating 0.1498&nbsp;gm.
of benzoic acid; average 0.1436&nbsp;gm., or 2.87 per cent. In a third case the temperature
reached 250&nbsp;C., and there was some decomposition of the fat in the
flask and some colored material distilled over. For this sublimate 15.54&nbsp;c.c.
of tenth-normal alkali were required.</p>

<p>After evaporating the alcohol and acidulating the solutions obtained in the
previous experiments, the benzoic acid was extracted with chloroform. In the
first case, 0.1383&nbsp;gm. was obtained; in the second, 0.1541&nbsp;gm.; average 0.1462&nbsp;gm.,
or 2.92 per cent. of benzoic acid.</p>

<p>When the original chloroformic extract was heated until all of the benzoic
acid had been driven off, the residue had the appearance of a semisolid fat.
It compared quite closely in color, odor, etc., with the fatty material obtained
by extracting colchicum seed with chloroform, although the odor was more
suggestive of oleic or stearic acid. It was distinctly acid, which is also true
of the fatty material obtained from a sample of colchicum seed.</p>

<p>The extract obtained with hot water was light yellow; gummy, at first, but
dried to a glass-like brittle mass. It had a slight burned-sugar odor and
taste, and was neutral in reaction. It was strongly dextrogyrate and at once
reduced Fehling’s solution as well as alkaline silver nitrate solution. On boiling
with potassium hydroxid solution, it turned deep red. It also gave the
Molisch carbohydrate reaction, and the ozazone test in seventeen minutes as
described in Mulliken (Identification of Pure Organic Compounds, Ed.&nbsp;1, 1905,
p.&nbsp;26). These are all characteristic reactions of lactose or milk sugar.</p>

<p>From this examination we conclude that DeSanctis’ pills contain powdered
colchicum seed, benzoic acid, and sugar of milk. There is also present fatty
material which resembles the fat of colchicum seed, but may be, in part,
added fatty acid. The percentage of colchicin found (0.50) is about that of a
<span class="pagenum" title="365"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a></span>good quality of colchicum seed, the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeial standard being not
less than 0.45 per cent. Since the pills contain material other than colchicum
seed, this assay would indicate a colchicum seed of high alkaloidal content, or
the possible reinforcement of the pills with colchicum extract or colchicin.</p>

<p>The amount of benzoic acid, 2.92 per cent., or about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>7</sub></span> grain per pill, is
insignificant from a therapeutic standpoint, since an average dose is 0.5&nbsp;gm.,
or 8 grains. Fatty acids, and the fatty matter from colchicum seed are inert,
at least in the quantities found here. The only office which fatty acids might
perform, would be to give the pills an enteric quality, preventing their absorption
until they reach the intestine. The sugar of milk, about 10 per cent., or
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain per pill, no doubt is simply an excipient.</p>

<p>DeSanctis’ pills are therefore essentially 5 grain doses of powdered colchicum
seed, of which the average dose is 0.2&nbsp;gm., or 3 grains (U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. IX,
p.&nbsp;120).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> in presenting the facts contained in the above report made
the following comments:</p>

<p>“Here then, we have sold for self-medication an extremely poisonous drug,
with no warning of the risk the public runs in using it. While the directions
call for “one pill every eight hours until relieved,” it is notorious that the
public takes the attitude toward “patent medicines” that, if a little is good,
more is better, and the average user of remedies for self-treatment is likely,
unless there is some warning, to use his own discretion as to the amount taken.</p>

<p>“The individual dose is above that of the average recommended in the
United States Pharmacopeia. Colchicum or its alkaloids&mdash;or for that matter,
any drug as toxic as colchicum&mdash;have no place in preparations of the home-remedy
type. In the case of all “patent medicines,” public interest demands
that the full quantitative formula of the thera­peutically active ingredients
should be given on the label, for when the public prescribes for itself, it has
a right to know what it is taking. Unfortunately, public interest clashes
with vested interests and, as usual, vested interests get the better of it. In
the case of such dangerous preparations as DeSanctis’ pills, if their sale is
to be permitted at all, not only should the names and quantities of all thera­peutically
active ingredients in the mixture be given, but the law should require
that the word Poison be plainly printed on the label.”&mdash;(<i>Abstracted from The

<h3>IODEX AND LIQUID IODEX</h3>


<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory examined Iodex in 1915<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_213_221" id="FNanchor_213_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_221" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> The claims
made, at that time, by the exploiters, Menley &amp; James, were shown to be
contrary to facts in that Iodex contained only traces of free iodin while they
claimed “5 per cent. Thera­peutically Free Iodin.” Even the <i>total</i> quantity of
iodin was shown to be only about one half of the 5 per cent. claimed to be
present as free iodin.</p>

<p>An examination of the advertising matter sent out by Menley &amp; James in
1919 showed that substantially the same claims were being made as in 1915.
This at once suggested the inquiry: Since the claims are the same as previously
made, have the manufacturers altered the composition to conform to
the claims? The answer is found in the results of the analysis of two samples
purchased in the open market early in 1919.</p>

<p>This analysis shows conclusively that Iodex is essentially the same as in
1915, that is, that it contains no free iodin and only about three fifths of the
total amount of iodin claimed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="366"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a></span></p>
<p>It would seem that Iodex (Ung. Iodi., M. &amp; J.) is in obvious conflict with
Section 7 of the Food and Drugs Act. While it is sold under a name recognized
by the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, namely, Ung. Iodi., it does not conform to
the standards of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia for that product. Iodin ointment
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. is made with 4 per cent. of free iodin, 4 per cent. of potassium iodid,
12 per cent. of glycerin, and a benzoinated lard base. It should then contain
approximately 7 per cent. of total iodin. It has been shown by <span class="nowrap">Warren<a name="FNanchor_214_222" id="FNanchor_214_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_222" class="fnanchor">214</a></span> that
about 75 per cent. of the iodin in the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. ointment remains in the free
state even after months of standing. Ung. Iodi., U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., then, should contain
about 3 per cent. of free iodin. Iodex contains no free iodin, or but
traces, and no potassium iodid. Furthermore, the Iodex label declares the
presence of 5 per cent. of “thera­peutically free” iodin. As a matter of fact,
the amount of iodin is variable, the highest amount found being 3.5 per cent.
and samples containing as low as 2.63 per cent. have been examined.</p>

<p>It would seem further that Iodex is misbranded under the Sherley amendment
in that it is said that it “may be used externally with advantage in all
cases where the action of iodin is desired.” Since it contains no iodin as
such this cannot possibly be true. It is also stated in a circular accompanying
the trade package that “Thirty minutes after inunction iodin can be found in
the urine.” This statement has also been shown to be untrue.&mdash;(<i>Annual Reports
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chem. Lab., 1915, p.&nbsp;89.</i>)</p>


<h4>Details of Analysis</h4>

<p><b>Iodex.</b>&mdash;This is a rather soft ointment, almost black but with a decided
greenish cast in thin layers. It is soluble in chloroform but is only partly
saponified and dissolved by alcoholic potassium hydroxid. Iodex has a distinct
odor like oleic acid.</p>

<p><i>Free Iodin.</i>&mdash;When examined by the method previously <span class="nowrap">used<a name="FNanchor_215_223" id="FNanchor_215_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_223" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> only minute
traces of free iodin were found.</p>

<p><i>Total Iodin.</i>&mdash;The methods employed were as follows: 1. Iodex was
saponified by boiling for from two to three hours with alcoholic potassium
hydroxid. The alcohol was then evaporated and the iodin determined by the
method described in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia for thymol iodid.</p>

<p>2. The same as Method 1, except that after ignition of the saponified mixture
the halogen was determined by weighing as silver iodid.</p>

<p>3. The Carius method.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Methods 2 and 3 determine chlorin and bromin
should any be present with the iodin.</p>

<p>When 5&nbsp;gm. of Sample 1 was assayed by Method 1, it required 73.56&nbsp;c.c. of
tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate, equivalent to 3.11 per cent. of iodin. In a
duplicate, 2.7565&nbsp;gm. of Iodex required 38&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate,
equivalent to 2.92 per cent. of iodin; average of the two, 3.02 per cent.
of iodin.</p>

<p>A weight of 2.5800&nbsp;gm. of Sample 1, assayed by Method 2, gave 0.1582&nbsp;gm.
of silver halid, equivalent to 0.0855&nbsp;gm. of iodin, or 3.31 per cent.</p>

<p>A weight of 0.588&nbsp;gm. of Sample 2, assayed by the Carius method, gave
0.0388&nbsp;gm. of silver halid, indicating 0.02096&nbsp;gm. of iodin, or 3.52 per cent. In
a duplicate, 0.5342&nbsp;gm. gave 0.0338&nbsp;gm. of silver halid, indicating 0.01826&nbsp;gm.
of iodin, or 3.42 per cent.; average, 3.49 per cent. of iodin.</p>

<p><b>Liquid Iodex.</b>&mdash;This is sold by Menley &amp; James, Ltd., the firm selling Iodex
Ointment. According to a circular in a trade package “the valuable properties
of Free Iodine are available in Liquid ‘Iodex’ in a state of greatly enhanced
activity; but the irritating, corrosive and hardening drawbacks of ordinary
solutions of the drug are absent.” The label on a bottle reads as follows:
<span class="pagenum" title="367"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a></span>“Liquid ‘Iodex’ (Liq. Iodi. M. &amp; J.). A nonirritant preparation of iodine
(2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>%) <span class="ell">..</span>. This product contains Free Iodine<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>The sample of Liquid Iodex purchased on the open market was found to be
a reddish liquid with an odor like oleic acid. It dissolved completely in
chloroform.</p>

<p><i>Free Iodin.</i>&mdash;A weight of 6.2936&nbsp;gm. was dissolved in chloroform and the
solution shaken with 25&nbsp;c.c. of a solution of potassium iodid. The iodin which
passed into the potassium iodid solution was titrated with tenth-normal sodium
thiosulphate, 0.81&nbsp;c.c. being required. This indicates 0.01022&nbsp;gm. of iodin, or
0.16 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Total Iodin.</i>&mdash;Total iodin was determined by Method 1 as given above under
Iodex. A weight of 4.466&nbsp;gm. required 32.93&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal sodium
thiosulphate, equivalent to 0.06964&nbsp;gm. of iodin, or 1.55 per cent. In a duplicate,
5&nbsp;gm. of material required 33.3&nbsp;c.c. of tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate,
equivalent to 0.7043&nbsp;gm. of iodin, or 1.41 per cent.; average, 1.48 per cent.
of iodin.</p>

<p>Liquid Iodex, then, contains but little (0.16 per cent.) free iodin and only
about three fifths of the total iodin claimed.</p>


<h3>I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O.</h3>

<p>I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O. is an iodin ointment. It is said to be made by Dr. H.&nbsp;S. Lambdin,
Peru, Kansas. In a circular distributed by the manufacturer, it is stated that
“I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O. is a saturated solution of Iodine Gas in petrolatum at 130 degrees
with oil of eucalyptus. The heat of the body liberates the iodine and it is
absorbed as free iodine.”</p>

<p>A sample of I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O., received from a physician, was examined. It was
found to be a black ointment, green in thin layers, with a slight odor like
crude petroleum. By the methods used for the examination of Iodex, I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O.
was found to contain 0.59 per cent. of free iodin.&mdash;(<i>From Reports A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.

<h3>IODIN IN LIQUID PETROLATUM</h3>

<p class="author">A. H. Clark, Ph.G., Sc.B.</p>


<p>Of all the things used in medicine nothing seems to have attracted the
attention of all classes of users as has iodin. Perhaps more romantic schemes
for the cure of all the ills which afflict mankind have centered in iodin therapy
than in any other one drug. Iodin is being used in every conceivable way from
crystals to colloid; in vapor; combined as iodid, iodate and the like; organic,
inorganic, simple and complex; internal, external and by injection, and yet
there seems to be no end to the ingenious schemes for its exploitation.</p>

<p>One of these schemes, and one so simple that it seems at first sight to be
hardly worth serious consideration, is that of a solution of iodin in liquid
petrolatum. Solutions of this kind have frequently been offered to physicians
and the laity. The thing of particular interest is the claim made as to the
percentage of free iodin. Five per cent. is frequently claimed. Examination
of some of these products in the chemical laboratory of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_216_224" id="FNanchor_216_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_224" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> revealed
the fact that they did not contain the claimed amount of free iodin. These
questions at once arose: Was the low free iodin content due to intentional
fraud, the result of carelessness, or of ignorance? Was it impossible to prepare
a solution containing 5 per cent., or did the iodin slowly combine with
the oil and disappear?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="368"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a></span></p>
<p>Several years ago the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical <span class="nowrap">Laboratory<a name="FNanchor_217_225" id="FNanchor_217_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_225" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> conducted some
experiments on the solubility of iodin in liquid petrolatum, which indicated that
a saturated solution would contain about 1.4 per cent. These experiments did
not show conclusively that no iodin was absorbed by the petrolatum during the
process of solution. For this reason, further experiments were conducted with
the view of determining both the solubility in and the extent to which iodin
is absorbed (disappears as free iodin), if at all, by liquid petrolatums of
various kinds. Theoretically such hydrocarbons should not absorb iodin. The
results of these experiments are here given.</p>

<p>A sample of iodin was prepared by sublimation from a mixture with potassium
iodid. This sample when dried over sulphuric acid assayed 99.98 per
cent. of iodin. Portions of this sample were used in all of the subsequent
experiments. To prepare solutions of definite concentrations, in all cases
expressed as percentage by weight, an accurately weighed quantity of iodin
was placed in a glass-stoppered bottle and an accurately weighed quantity of
liquid petrolatum added. The mixture was subjected to treatment as indicated
in the various experiments and from the weights of iodin and petrolatum used
the percentage of iodin was calculated.</p>

<p>The method of assay employed was as follows: A weighed quantity of the
iodin solution was transferred to a bottle or flask by means of several small
amounts of chloroform, about 50&nbsp;c.c. in all. To this was added about 25&nbsp;c.c.
of potassium iodid solution. The mixture was then titrated with tenth-normal
sodium thiosulphate until on thorough shaking no iodin passed into the
aqueous layer.</p>

<p>To 2.1248&nbsp;gm. of iodin was added 199.3&nbsp;gm. of liquid petrolatum. The
mixture was shaken frequently each day and after forty days there seemed
to be still a few particles of iodin undissolved. The supernatant solution was
assayed, however, and found to contain 1.038 per cent. of iodin. The iodin
added was 1.055 per cent. Six months later 1.025 per cent. of iodin was found.</p>

<p>To 5.1832&nbsp;gm. of iodin was added 199.5&nbsp;gm. of liquid petrolatum. The
mixture was heated to 100&nbsp;C. for four hours with frequent shaking. The iodin
was in perfect solution. The per cent. of iodin would then be 4.95. Upon cooling,
iodin in abundance crystallized out. After standing a few hours, with frequent
shaking, the iodin in solution was determined. This was found to be
1.425 per cent.</p>

<p>These two experiments indicate: First, that the previous findings of the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory are correct in that only about 1.4 per cent. of
free iodin is retained in solution in liquid petrolatum at room temperature.
Second, that the quantity of iodin absorbed by liquid petrolatum at room temperature,
in seven months at least, is practically none. Third, that iodin dissolves
rather slowly in liquid petrolatum at room temperature.</p>

<p>In the experiments, the results of which are tabulated below, the iodin and
liquid petrolatum were heated at 100&nbsp;C. for about four hours, shaking frequently
to hasten solution. After cooling, the specimens were assayed and
were again assayed at intervals as indicated in the table.</p>

<p>* Considerable dark sediment formed in this sample during the heating process.</p>

<p>† It should be pointed out here that while every sample showed some absorption, the
amount, with the exception of the unknown bulk, is so small that it might even be
accounted for on the basis of “experimental error.” Every ordinary precaution was taken
to insure accuracy, but since about 15&nbsp;gm. of the solution was used for each determination,
it is seen that an error of 0.3&nbsp;c.c. in the titration would indicate a greater absorption of
iodin than that noted.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="369"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a></span></p>
<p>Conclusions: These experiments show: A solution of iodin in liquid petrolatum
is saturated when it contains about 1.4 per cent. of iodin. The amount
of iodin absorbed (disappearing as free iodin) by liquid petrolatum, when in
contact at room temperature for as long as seven months, or in contact at
100&nbsp;C. for four hours, or both, is relatively insignificant. Also all the absorption
seems to take place during the heating and in the first month of contact.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>AMERICAN-MADE SYNTHETIC DRUGS&mdash;II</h3>

<h4>Examination of Procain (Novocain), Barbital (Veronal), Phenetidyl-Acetphenetidin
(Holocain), Cinchophen or Phenyl­cinchoninic
Acid (Atophan), Manufactured Under Federal
Trade Commission <span class="nowrap">Licenses<a name="FNanchor_I_226" id="FNanchor_I_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_226" class="fnanchor">[I]</a><a name="FNanchor_J_227" id="FNanchor_J_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_227" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></span></h4>

<p class="author">Paul Nicholas Leech, Ph.D.; William Rabak, Ph.G., Sc.B., and
A.&nbsp;H. Clark, Ph.G., Sc.B.</p>


<p>Before European hostilities, the United States was so dependent on Germany
for synthetic drugs that the dependence was considered a necessity; this
was strikingly manifested by the precipitous rise in prices immediately after
the embargo was declared against Germany. Since then the shortage of
German-made synthetics has caused two important results: 1. The physician
can do without most of the German drugs, because the prewar demand had
been stimulated artificially. 2. Those few synthetics, which were in great need,
are being rapidly replaced by the American-made drugs<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_218_228" id="FNanchor_218_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_228" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> In connection with
the second result, the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association
has endeavored to contribute its services.</p>

<p>In September, 1917, it was announced<a name="FNanchor_219_229" id="FNanchor_219_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_229" class="fnanchor">219</a> that the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
would make studies of American-made synthetics. Just prior to this
announcement, the National Research Council established a committee on
synthetic <span class="nowrap">drugs<a name="FNanchor_220_230" id="FNanchor_220_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_230" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> “to facilitate the manufacture of synthetic drugs in this country
and thus to relieve shortage and reduce the exorbitant prices which have
resulted from the war.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_221_231" id="FNanchor_221_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_231" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> Also during this time Congress was considering the
“trading with enemy” act, first known as the Adamson bill&mdash;the purpose of
which was to confer authority on the President to license American firms to
use U.&nbsp;S. patents owned by German subjects. The act became law, September
28; the Federal Trade Commission was designated by the President to
carry out the provisions of the law as it referred to enemy-owned patents.
As a result of a conference, Oct. 30, 1917<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_222_232" id="FNanchor_222_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_232" class="fnanchor">222</a></span> with various agencies, the Federal
Trade Commission decided to consider licenses for manufacturers of synthetic
drugs, <i>after</i> recommendations had been made by the Committee on Synthetic
Drugs of the National Research Council; this committee in turn invoked the
aid of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory in testing the manufacturer’s products.
The essence of the laboratory’s work up to July 1, 1919, is reported in this paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="370"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></span></p>

<h5>THE NAMING OF LICENSED DRUGS</h5>

<p>“Partly in order to help insure to licensees a market for their products
after the war, in larger part inspired by the idea of encouraging the establishment
of a permanent American industry in these important articles, the
[Federal Trade] Commission wisely decided that American houses should be
put on the same footing as competing foreign houses for after-the-war competition,
by imposing on all licensees the obligation to use <i>new official names</i>
for the articles, names which after the war will be open to all competitors,
domestic and foreign.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_223_233" id="FNanchor_223_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_233" class="fnanchor">223</a></span></p>

<p class="plhi">The new American names are:<br />

Arsphenamin<a name="FNanchor_224_234" id="FNanchor_224_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_234" class="fnanchor">224</a> (contracted from the scientific name arsenphenolamin) for
salvarsan, arsenobenzol, diarsanol, arsaminol.<br />

Barbital (contracted from the scientific name diethyl-barbituric acid) for
veronal.<br />

Barbital-sodium (the sodium salt of barbital) for “veronal-sodium” and
“medinal.”<br />

Cinchophen for atophan or phenyl­cinchoninic acid (the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. IX name).<br />

Procain for novocain hydrochlorid (from “pro” and “(co)caine”).<br />

Procain nitrate for novocain nitrate.</p>


<h5>EXAMINATION OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS</h5>

<p>In testing chemically the products which had been submitted to the Federal
Trade Commission, the aims were that the product should conform to a
high degree of purity; at the same time the candidate for license should not
be inflicted with undue hardships in making the product, such as an unnecessarily
high degree of purity. It was insisted that the purity of the drugs should
be equal to, if not greater than, that of the respective former German-made
products, in order to uphold the name and reputation of the American manufacturers
in the after-the-war competition. Consequently, in the chemical work
the American product was always examined parallel with the German-made
product, authentic samples of the latter of which the laboratory had in its
possession. Whenever possible, the tests described in books of standards were
carried out.</p>


<h5>BARBITAL (VERONAL)</h5>

<p>Barbital was introduced into medicine under the proprietary name “veronal,”
and was manufactured in Germany by Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co., Leverkusen, and
E. Merck &amp; Co., Darmstadt, Germany. Barbital is described in New and
Non­official Remedies, 1919<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_225_235" id="FNanchor_225_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_235" class="fnanchor">225</a></span> as di­ethyl­barbituric acid (diethylmalonyl urea)
having the formula:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/370.jpg" width="160" height="68" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is official in the British Pharmacopeia under the name “barbitone,” and
in the German Pharmacopeia as “acidum di­ethyl­barbit­uricum.” Barbital “may
be prepared by the interaction of esters of di­ethyl­malonic acid with urea in
<span class="pagenum" title="371"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a></span>the presence of metallic alcoholates<span class="ell">...</span>. It is also obtained by condensation
of di­ethyl­cyan­acetic ester with urea by means of sodium alcoholate.”
Barbital is used in medicine chiefly as a hypnotic.</p>

<p>The different brands of barbital which were submitted to the laboratory
were subjected to the tests given in the books referred to above<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_226_236" id="FNanchor_226_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_236" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> The products
were:</p>

<p>1. Barbital (Abbott) Sample A, to Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>2. Barbital (Abbott) Sample B, to Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>3. Barbital (Abbott) Sample C, to Red Cross.</p>

<p>4. Barbital (Antoine Chiris), to Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>5. Barbital (V. Halter), to Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>6. Barbital (Rector Chemical Company) to Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>7. Di­ethyl­barbituric acid (Merck), to Council.</p>

<p>8. “Veronal,” manufactured by Farb. vorm Fried. Bayer &amp; Co., Germany.</p>

<p>All responded satisfactorily to the tests. In Table 1 are given the respective
melting points and percentages of ash found. (The melting point of a mixture
of the sample with the original “veronal” was always taken.)</p>

<p>Barbital does not seem  to form an insoluble salt with chlorplatinic acid;
nor an ether-insoluble hydrochlorid or oxalate; nor an insoluble barium salt.
It does not respond to many urea tests, and is not affected by urease as would
be expected in light of the extensive investigations made on this enzyme by
Van Slyke and Cullen.</p>

<p>As barbital is also sold in the form of tablets or mixtures, a reliable method
for its quantitative determination in the presence of other substances is needed.
Some experiments in this direction were made, but the press of other work
did not permit their continuation. When time permits, this work will be
resumed.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, licenses for manufacture had been granted
by the Federal Trade Commission to the Abbott Laboratories, to Antoine
Chiris Company, and to the Rector Chemical Company.</p>


<h5>BARBITAL SODIUM (MEDINAL OR VERONAL-SODIUM)</h5>

<p>Barbital sodium, formerly sold under the proprietary names “veronal-sodium”
and “medinal,” is, as the former name suggests, the sodium salt of
di­ethyl­barbituric acid. Its therapeutic advantages are stated to be that more
rapid results are obtained because of its increased solubility over barbital
alone<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_227_237" id="FNanchor_227_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_237" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> Barbital sodium should yield, according to theory, 11.19 per cent. of
sodium and 89.31 per cent. of di­ethyl­barbituric acid. A number of years ago,
when “veronal-sodium” and “medinal” were being introduced, Puckner and
<span class="nowrap">Hilpert<a name="FNanchor_228_238" id="FNanchor_228_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_238" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> found that these products yielded results corresponding closely to
the theoretical amounts of sodium and di­ethyl­barbituric acid. A recent examination
of veronal-sodium, Merck, made for the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry, showed it to be of the same composition as that previously reported.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="372"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a></span></p>

<div class="p">Only one firm’s product has been submitted to the laboratory through the
Committee on Synthetic Drugs, but because of the unsatisfactory results, it
was not recommended for license, nor, as far as we are aware, has the firm
investigated its anomalies<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_229_239" id="FNanchor_229_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_239" class="fnanchor">229</a></span> The amount of moisture in this specimen was
0.04 per cent. It yielded 10.94 and 10.97 per cent, of sodium. Puckner and
Hilpert found 11.02 per cent. of sodium in “medinal,” and 11.01 per cent. of
sodium in “veronal-sodium.” The theoretical amount, according to the formula
given for medinal by the proprietors <span class="mono nowrap">(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span>&#8239;<table class="inline2 mono"><tr><td>CCONNaCONHCO<br />└─────────┘</td></tr></table> is 11.19 per
cent. When an aqueous solution of barbital sodium was acidified, and the
di­ethyl­barbituric acid extracted with ether, it was found that the amount of
freed acid extracted varied directly with the length of time after acidification.</div>


<p>It is possible that in preparing the sodium salt of di­ethyl­barbituric acid, the
ring opens up, forming a compound not so easily affected by dilute mineral acids.</p>

<h5>PHENETIDYL-ACETPHENETIDIN HYDROCHLORID<a name="FNanchor_230_240" id="FNanchor_230_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_240" class="fnanchor">230</a> (HOLOCAIN HYDROCHLORID)</h5>

<p>Phenetidyl-acetphenetidin hydrochlorid was introduced in the United States
under the name of “holocain hydrochloride” by Farbwerke, vorm Meister
Lucius and Bruening, Hoechst a. M. Germany; the product apparently had not
been patented in this country, although it was protected in Germany under
patents No. 78868 and 80568. New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, describes
“holocain hydrochlorid” as ethenyl-paradiethoxy-diphenyl-amidin hydro­chlorid
CH<sub>3</sub>:(NC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(NHC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)HCl. It is used as a local anesthetic for
the eye.</p>

<p>The standards, such as had been described, were meager and unsatisfactory.
Hence when the first specimen of American-made phenetidyl-acetphenetidin
was sent to the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory through the agency of the
Federal Trade Commission and the Committee on Synthetic Drugs, it was
necessary for the laboratory to work out adequate standards<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_231_241" id="FNanchor_231_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_241" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> As a result of
the chemical work, a rather comprehensive monograph was drawn up, which
was published in the 1918 Laboratory Reports. A summary of the products
examined, with some of the chemical data, is given in Table 3. It will be seen
that one specimen had a deficiency of about 2 per cent. of free base.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission has not issued any licenses for the manufacture
of “holocain hydrochlorid.” The John T. Milliken Company has withdrawn
its application. The H.&nbsp;A. Metz Laboratories (Successor to Farbwerke
Hoechst Company, New York) are making the product in this country.</p>


<h5>CINCHOPHEN (PHENYLCINCHONINIC ACID, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.; ATOPHAN)</h5>

<p>Cinchophen (phenyl­cinchoninic acid) was introduced in the United States
as a medicine under the proprietary name “atophan,” by Schering and Glatz,
New York City, who before the war were the American agents for the German
manufacturers “Chemische Fabric auf Actien von E. Schering, Berlin.” Phenyl­cinchoninic
acid (2 phenyl-quinolin-4 carboxylic acid) was first described by
Doebner and <span class="nowrap">Gieseke<a name="FNanchor_233_243" id="FNanchor_233_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_243" class="fnanchor">233</a></span> in 1887, who prepared it by warming together pyro-racemic
acid, benzaldehyd and anilin in alcoholic solution; it has the structural
formula:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/373b.jpg" width="140" height="78" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The chief use of phenyl­cinchoninic acid is as an antiuric acid agent, especially
indicated in gout.</p>

<p>In 1913, the German house of Schering was made the assignee of patent
1045759 granted by the United States <span class="nowrap">government<a name="FNanchor_234_244" id="FNanchor_234_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_244" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> for the manufacture of
phenyl­cinchoninic acid: at about the same time the product was admitted to
the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia IX, under very loosely constructed standards.</p>

<p>Some time after the beginning of the European war the proprietary “atophan”
became scarce in America. In 1917, however, Schering and Glatz, New York,
placed American-made atophan on the market and submitted it to the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry. Later, other firms began to manufacture the
product and also submitted specimens. During the time it was investigating
these products, the Federal Trade Commission decided that a license was
needed to manufacture phenyl­cinchoninic acid under the patent just referred
to, so that altogether the laboratory had a number of specimens to examine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="374"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a></span></p>

<p>In making the examinations for the Council, the laboratory was practically
confined, by virtue of the Food and Drugs Law, to limit its requirements of
purity to those of the Pharmacopeia. Practically, the only tests were melting
point, ash and solubility. According to the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia the melting
point is “about 210.” In New and Non­official Remedies, 1918, it was explained
<span class="pagenum" title="375"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></span>that atophan “complies with the standards for phenyl­cinchoninic acid, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.,
but melts between 208 and 212&nbsp;C.” The U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia requires that no
weighable ash remains on incinerating about 0.5&nbsp;gm. of phenyl­cinchoninic acid.
Con­siderable variations, especially in melting points, were found, as can be
seen from Table 4.</p>

<p>By referring to this table on melting points and ash content it will be noted
that the production of a better grade of products resulted after the respective
firms had submitted samples to the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory for criticism,
and from a chemical standpoint, the last products examined were found to
be as satisfactory as the German-made “atophan.”</p>

<p><i>Solubility of Cinchophen (Phenyl­cinchoninic Acid).</i>&mdash;As methods of determining
impurities, or estimating the degree of purity of phenyl­cinchoninic acid
were not described in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, it was decided to try extraction
methods<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_235_245" id="FNanchor_235_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_245" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> This in turn led to the question of solubilities. The U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
gives the solubility of phenyl­cinchoninic acid only in general terms;
hence it was deemed advisable to determine its solubilities and describe them
in more definite terms. The sample of phenyl­cinchoninic acid employed to
determine the solubility was obtained by repeated recrystallization from alcohol
of a commercial specimen. Solubilities were determined in water; 95.0 per cent.

<p>The Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, have been licensed by the Federal Trade
Commission to manufacture cinchophen. Other firms, however, have decided
to manufacture it without the formality of obtaining a license, evidently considering
the German-obtained patent not to be valid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_239_249" id="FNanchor_239_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_249" class="fnanchor">239</a></span></p>


<h5>PROCAIN (NOVOCAIN)</h5>

<p>Procain was introduced in medicine under the proprietary name “novocain,”
and before the war was obtainable in this country only through the Farbwerke
Hoechst Company, the American representative of the German establishment,
Farbwerke vorm Meister Lucius Bruening, Hoechst a. M. Chemically it is
the mono-hydrochlorid of para-amino-benzoyl-diethyl-amino-ethanol, having
the structural formula:</p>

<p class="tac">NH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<img src="images/benzene.jpg" width="35" height="21" style="margin-bottom: -0.5em;" alt="" />COO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>&mdash;N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.HCl</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="376"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a></span></p>
<p>It is prepared according to U.&nbsp;S. patent No. 812554 (issued to Alfred
Einhorn, Munich, Germany) by treating para-nitro-benzoyl­chlorid with ethylene
chlor­hydrin and diethyl­amin with subsequent reduction of the nitro groups, the
resulting product being purified by recrystal­lization.</p>

<p>Procain is employed largely in infiltration anesthesia. It is less toxic than
cocain, but its anesthetic action is not sustained. This drawback is overcome
by the simultaneous injection of epinephrin, and for this reason procain is often
compounded with epinephrin in tablets, thus obviating the necessity of separate
solutions.</p>

<p>When the first specimens of the American-made product were submitted
through the channels of the Federal Trade Commission, it was necessary to
compile a monograph<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_240_250" id="FNanchor_240_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_250" class="fnanchor">240</a></span> This was prepared from descriptions in the available
literature, mostly from tests described in New and Non­official Remedies, 1918,
and the German Pharmacopeia V.</p>

<p>The submitted products were found satisfactory chemically. The toxicity
determinations made by Dr. R.&nbsp;A. Hatcher, with the assistance of Dr. Carey
<span class="nowrap">Eggleston<a name="FNanchor_241_251" id="FNanchor_241_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_251" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> indicated that none of the specimens are to be considered dangerous
when used in ordinary dosage for normal individuals. Therefore the
Federal Trade Commission, on recommendation of the Committee on Synthetic
Drugs of the National Research Council (aided by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory),
issued licenses for the manufacture of procain to the Farbwerke-Hoechst
Company (which license was later transferred to the H.&nbsp;A. Metz
Laboratories), to the Abbott Laboratories, to the Calco Chemical Company and
to the Rector Chemical Company.</p>

<p>Subsequently the products of the licensed firms were submitted to the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, which in turn invoked the aid of the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory and the Cornell University Pharmacologic Laboratory.
Later the Council asked the laboratory to examine the <i>market</i> supply.
Altogether, therefore, a number of products were examined which were found
to respond satisfactorily to the tests outlined (Table 6).</p>

<p>* U. S. Patent 812,554&mdash;the novocain patent&mdash;declares that the salt melts at 156&nbsp;C. Evidently
based on this, both the German Pharmacopeia and past editions of New and Non­official
Remedies give this melting point. Two specimens of German-made novocain obtained from
our files, stated to be manufactured by Farbwerke-Hoechst vorm. Meister, Lucius and Bruening,
Hoechst a. M., were found to melt, respectively, between 154 and 155&nbsp;C. and between 153.5
and 154.5&nbsp;C. when the melting point was determined according to the direction of the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia, ninth revision. The various specimens examined at that time melted between
153 and 155&nbsp;C., and it was decided to permit this range.</p></div>

<p>An examination of some American-made procain-suprarenin tablets was also
made. The procain was determined by liberation of the alkaloid with ammonia
water, extraction with chloroform, evaporation of the chloroform, dissolving
the alkaloid in one hundredth normal sulphuric acid solution and titrating excess
acid with one hundredth normal sodium hydroxid solution. The epinephrin
was determined according to the method employed by Seidell<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_242_252" id="FNanchor_242_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_252" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> with slight modifications.
The tablets contained the claimed amounts of ingredients.</p>


<h5>THE SYNTHETIC DRUG SITUATION</h5>

<p>Before the war, the American physician was literally bombarded with new
and wonderful (?) coal-tar synthetics, most of which were originated in Germany.
In fact, it seemed that if a by-product in the manufacture of dyes could
not be used for a dye per se, then a place might be found for it in the ever
increasing lists of medicaments. By clever advertising and propaganda among
physicians, an artificial stimulation for coal-tar drugs was created which evidently
yielded lucrative financial returns. As a result of the war, it is interesting
to observe that of all the synthetic drugs imported into this country from
Germany and on which the American patents were controlled by the Germans
(up to the time of our entrance into the war), the demand was really sufficient
enough to warrant the commercial manufacture of only four of them by American
firms. Of course, a larger number of <i>nonpatented drugs</i>, also imported
from Germany, are now being made in sufficient quantities in this country;
<span class="pagenum" title="377"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></span>many of the drugs in this class were never patented or are the ones which have
survived after the patent had expired, such as acetanilid, acetphenetidin, and
acetyl­salicylic acid.</p>

<p>In view of the agitation to found an institute for cooperative research as
an aid to the American drug industry under the auspices of the American
Chemical Society, it will be well for the medical profession to be on its guard
against too enthusiastic propaganda on the part of those engaged in the laudable
enterprise of promoting American chemical industry. Unless it is, it may
be inflicted in the future, as in the past, with a large number of drugs that are
either useless, harmful or unessential modifications of well-known pharmaceuticals.
It will be well also for the chemists&mdash;those engaged in this enterprise&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="378"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a></span>to
be sure that the product is of therapeutic value before asking its use as
a medicine. The American medical profession has learned that relatively few
of the many German synthetics were really valuable or decided improvements
over established drugs. If American chemists desire to retain their prestige
with the medical profession, they should earnestly endeavor to see that the
advantages derived from the war and from such an institute as proposed are
not abused in the worthy desire to popularize chemistry both educationally and
commercially. They should realize that physicians are in no receptive mood
for a flood of synthetics, even though “American-made.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the constructive possibilities of chemistry in the service
of medicine should serve as a stimulus for American research. Notwithstanding
all the pharmaceutical shrubbery which Germany sent to us, still it did
contain some synthetics that were worth while. As therapeutics has been
benefited by these organic chemicals, it is logical to reason by analogy that
there remain other synthetics to be discovered which will occupy places of
equal distinction in the modern materia medica. For example, vaccines are of
undoubted merit in the field of immunology, but their action is, in the end,
chemical; as soon as chemical technic is refined by medicochemical research,
it is quite possible that a definite chemical agent (synthetic) will supersede
the indefinite bacterial vaccine. Obviously the American chemist has the
opportunity of showing his resourcefulness in aiding the public health of
America and the world. In this connection, a cooperative institute devoted
to purely scientific drug research, and governed in such a manner as to inspire
confidence in its humanitarianism and unbiased judgment, should serve a most
commendable purpose. The hopes of American men of science are for a monumental
research institution&mdash;cooperative with all the allied professions&mdash;and,
as the <i>Chicago Chemical Bulletin stated</i>, “Stripped of all professional or commercial
pettishness and not dominated by any one group of scientists.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_243_253" id="FNanchor_243_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_253" class="fnanchor">243</a></span></p>


<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>As for the results of the work so far, they can be summed up in two
sentences.</p>

<p>1. American chemists are producing synthetic drugs formerly controlled by
Germany, and thus have declared their independence of German chemicals.</p>

<p>2. Judging from the evidence at hand, we can feel assured that the quality
of American synthetics will be second to none.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
Sept. 6, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>NOSTRUMS IN RETROSPECT</h3>

<h4>A Series of Nine Articles Reviewing Worthless or Unscientific
Proprietary Mixtures Previously Criticized</h4>

<p class="author">S. Q. Lapius, M.D.</p>

<hr class="r16" />
<p>[<span class="smcap">Foreword.</span>&mdash;It is more than twelve years since the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry of the American Medical Association was created. Since then
there have been but few issues of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> that have not called the attention
of the medical profession to the debasing influence on scientific medicine
of unscientific or worthless proprietary mixtures advertised to physicians for
their use in prescribing. The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry has investigated
and shown many of these preparations to be fraudulent in one way or
another, and these reports have been published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. In spite of
this, these preparations have been advertised continuously to physicians, through
medical journals and otherwise, and prescribed by a large number of physicians.
One reason for this is that there are many physicians who have never seen
these reports&mdash;who were not in active practice at the time, or who were not
reading <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. We probably have among our readers at the present
time 35,000 or 40,000 physicians who were not among the readers of <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> twelve years ago. It is desirable, then, that we should take up, in
more or less detail, several of the more widely advertised products that have
been the subjects of previous reports. It has been repeatedly stated in <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> that many of the proprietary mixtures&mdash;the so-called ethical proprietaries
advertised to physicians&mdash;were no better and no worse than “patent
medicines” advertised to the public.</p>

<p>Every physician who has the welfare of medicine at heart should put these
questions squarely to himself if he has not already taken a firm stand on this
whole problem: What is my attitude toward the work of the Council? Are
its reports worthy of acceptance? Am I upholding the Council in its efforts
to place therapeutics on a rational basis, not by blind faith alone, but by an
honestly critical attitude toward it? Am I following the path of indolence by
taking the advice of nostrum makers without any serious effort to determine
whether they are true or false? In a word, am I really practicing medicine,
or am I an unpaid agent and a dupe of nostrum makers? There are other
revolutions than political. The public can be wronged just as certainly by the
abuse of its confidence in clinicians as by the usurpers of political power, and
when the public is thoroughly aroused the heavy hand of retribution is not
likely to be too discriminating. That the sins of clinicians are standing out
plain for any one who wishes to read is becoming more and more evident.
There is but one short and ugly word that properly characterizes the physician
who accepts a fee for prescribing that about which he has no more knowledge
than has the one for whom he prescribes it. Are you with the nostrum makers
or with decent medicine?</p>

<p>The article below is the first of a series written for <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> by one
who is thoroughly conversant with the work of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry and can speak authoritatively on questions dealing with the action
of drugs and the treatment of diseases. We believe that these articles will
prove of interest and profit and that they will help physicians to answer the
questions just propounded.]</p>

<h4>Bell-Ans (Pa-Pay-Ans Bell)<a name="FNanchor_K_254" id="FNanchor_K_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_254" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></h4>


<p>Bell-ans, for years advertised only in medical journals under the name
“Pa-pay-ans (Bell),” is now advertised in newspapers as a remedy that “Absolutely
Removes Indigestion.” As it is still being advertised to physicians, we
propose to analyze the claims made for it with as much care as would be
exercised in the discussion of the newest discovery in medicine, because we
believe that it is desirable to show the trend of exploitation of a certain type
of preparation in the medical press.</p>

<p>In the <i>New York Medical Journal</i> the following advertisement recently
appeared on the front cover:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Acute Indigestion</span></p>

<p>Yesterday a great soldier and today the head of a big trust succumbed to an attack of
Acute Indigestion; and every day we hear from some physician of some case he has saved
with <span class="lowercase smcap">BELL-ANS</span> by giving <span class="lowercase smcap">SIX</span> (6) tablets dissolved in a glass of hot water and repeating if
necessary. Can any doctor who reads this fail to provide himself with the free supply of
<span class="lowercase smcap">BELL-ANS</span> which we gladly send for his emergency case?</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/380.jpg" width="375" height="193" alt="" />
<p class="tac">Typical of Bell-ans advertisements as appearing in medical journals.</p>
</div>

<p>A recently purchased package of Bell-ans contained a circular in which it
was stated that Bell-ans removes flatulence, vertigo, weakness and other symptoms
of indigestion quickly and pleasantly; that it aids the digestion of food
and tends to restore the digestive tract to a normal condition; that it relieves
vomiting in pregnancy, alcoholism, seasickness and cholera morbus, besides
being pleasant, harmless and effective for colic, sour stomach, feverishness, and
wakefulness of infants and children. The circular contained paragraphs purporting
to be taken from various medical journals, including the <i>New York
Medical Journal</i>, <i>Wisconsin Medical Recorder</i>, the <i>Lancet Clinic</i>, <i>International
Journal of Surgery</i>, and <i>Massachusetts Medical Journal</i>. No exact references
were given to permit verification or to determine whether or not the quotations
were from “reading notices” (advertisements) or from the scientific part of
the journals in question. To quote one of the statements given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The results from the use of Bell-ans (Pa-Pay-ans Bell) in the treatment of indigestion
are so prompt and so generally good&mdash;and the evidence of this fact is accumulating so rapidly
and from such reliable sources&mdash;that we venture to suggest to our readers who have not
tried this remedy that they prescribe one original sealed package of Bell-ans (Pa-pay-ans Bell)
and that they carefully note the results from its use.</p>

<p>“We suggest an original sealed package because the preparation is widely and badly imitated,
and unless such a package is specified an imitation of little value may be substituted
and the experiment be thus rendered useless.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="381"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a></span></p>
<p>It is possible that Bell-ans has been imitated, but it is not true that it is
widely imitated, for no such imitation has ever been called to our attention,
and we strongly suspect that the main reason for desiring that an original
package be dispensed is that the patient may see for himself the name <span class="lowercase smcap">BELL-ANS</span>
plainly blown in the glass.</p>

<p>The circular in question states that there is no derangement of the digestive
organs on which the proper dose of Bell-ans will not act quickly and pleasantly!
These are samples of the claims made for Bell-ans. Let us inquire into the
nature of the conditions for which the preparation is recommended and the
treatment advised by well known clinicians.</p>

<p>The subject of indigestion is discussed by Robert Hutchison and Robert
Saundby under the general title of dyspepsia in the “Index of Treatment by
Various Writers,” Edition 6, 1912, pp. 260–265. Hutchison says: “In the first
place it must be remembered that in many patients who complain of ‘indigestion’
the seat of the trouble is not in the stomach at all.”</p>

<div>Newspaper advertisement of Bell-ans, capitalizing the state­ments of physicians.</div>
</div>

<p>The general principles to be observed in the treatment of functional dyspepsia,
as given by Hutchison, are: (1) to remove the cause; (2) to adapt
the diet to the impaired functional power of the stomach; (3) to administer
such drugs as are calculated to stimulate or correct the particular function
or functions which happen to be impaired, or disordered. Proper diet, proper
mastication of food, hygiene of the mouth, and constipation are enumerated as
deserving attention. Careful attention to securing a proper diet is essential.
The choice of drugs depends, of course, on the conditions that give rise to
indigestion, and he calls attention to the necessity of avoiding all routine treatment
and compiling one’s prescription with an eye to the special disorder or
disorders of function, whether secretory, motor or sensory, believed to be
present. Hutchison gives the following typical prescriptions to illustrate the
use of drugs in the different disorders of function:</p>

<p class="title">FOR DEFECTIVE MOTILITY (ATONIC DYSPEPSIA, GASTROPTOSIS, ETC.)</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">Hutchison recommends the use of 10 minims of tincture of nux vomica in an aromatic
vehicle, such as infusion of quassia and compound tincture of cardamom; but another aromatic
bitter, such as the compound tincture of gentian, will serve quite as well, of course. This is
to be taken before each meal, and for the flatulence that often accompanies this trouble he gives
menthol, aromatic spirit of ammonia and spirit of chloroform, as may be needed.</p>

<p class="title">FOR ACID DYSPEPSIA</p>

<p class="ml2em fs85">Robert Saundby recommends the following to be used before each meal for the relief of
acid dyspepsia: sodium bicarbonate, bismuth subcarbonate, magnesium carbonate, of each 10
grains; mucilage of tragacanth 15 minims, and enough peppermint water to make an ounce.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the conditions that are discussed by Hutchison
and Saundby, but they serve to show that the treatment of indigestion by a
single prescription or combination is wholly irrational.</p>

<p>Bell-ans, both under its present name and under its older name, “Pa-pay-ans
(Bell),” has always been alleged by its manufacturers to contain papain or
to be a preparation of the digestive juice from the fruit of <i>Carica papaya</i>
(papaw) with other substances. Various chemists have attempted to find
papain present and to determine the digestive power of the tablets, but without
success. For this reason <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> suggested that the change of name
from “Pa-pay-ans (Bell)” to “Bell-ans” was probably not made entirely for
euphonious reasons, as alleged, especially when one considers that the name
of a nostrum is its most valuable asset. It is much more likely that as analyses
indicated there was not and probably never had been any papain present in
the product, the name was changed for fear that some day the misleading term
“Pa-pay-ans” might bring the preparation in conflict with the federal Food
and Drugs Act.</p>

<p>Pa-pay-ans (Bell) was examined for the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
in 1909 and the tablets were found to consist of charcoal, sodium bicarbonate,
ginger, saccharin and oil of gaultheria. No digestive ferment could
be detected in the tablets. Sodium bicarbonate is antacid and serves to dissolve
mucus; ginger, if in sufficient amount, causes the expulsion of flatus, and
charcoal, while an absorbent in the dry state, is probably useless for any
therapeutic purpose whatever after it becomes saturated with gastric juice.
Bell-ans, then, has all of the virtues, which are few, and all of the limitations,
which are many, of a tablet of sodium bicarbonate and ginger. Its value in
the treatment of acute indigestion would be limited to the value of a tablet
of such a composition. It is absurd to suppose that it could have the slightest
value in the far more serious conditions attended with intestinal indigestion,
with the toxemia and auto­intoxication to which they give rise.</p>

<p>Bell-ans is now advertised directly to the public&mdash;but it is no less valuable
on that account. True, it is a “patent medicine” in the commonly accepted
sense of the term, but it is no more a “patent medicine” today than it was
fifteen years ago when it reached the public, not through the direct medium
of the newspapers but the more indirect route of the medical journals and
undiscriminating physicians. It is true that, in view of the serious nature of
<span class="pagenum" title="383"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></span>many conditions which are loosely spoken of by the public as “indigestion,”
its present method of exploitation is likely to make it just that much more
dangerous because of the larger publicity that will be given. The point to be
borne in mind is that Bell-ans is now in fact what it has always been in
essence, a “patent medicine.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again we ask the question: How do you wish to be classified, Doctor&mdash;among
those who follow blindly the lead of a firm of nostrum makers, or
among the intelligent members of the profession who study their cases carefully
and prescribe intelligently? The manufacturers of Bell-ans claim that
100,000 American physicians now prescribe Bell-ans, and that 600,000,000 of
the tablets are sold annually. If this is even approximately true it is a serious
reflection on the medical profession, for the Council examined Bell-ans and
reported its findings nearly eight years ago (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>53</b>:569 [Aug. 14] 1909),
and the statements made in that report are as incontrovertible today as they
were then.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 24, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">Article II</span>]</h3>

<h4>Anasarcin and Anedemin</h4>


<p>“Anasarcin” and “Anedemin” are the twin nostrums of cardiac pseudotherapy.
They are dubbed “twin nostrums” not so much because of any similarity in
their formulas, that being a minor consideration in the average nostrum, but
because of the close similarity in their methods of exploitation, the therapeutic
claims made for them, and the time and place of their birth.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that they both claim Winchester, Tenn., as their
birthplace, and they appeared on the market at about the same time; furthermore,
a comparison of the claims formerly made for both of them indicated
that one mind conceived the main idea that lies back of their exploitation.
While Anasarcin is especially dealt with in this article, much of the discussion
applies with equal force to Anedemin.</p>


<h5>A LUSH FIELD FOR NOSTRUMS</h5>

<p>Cardiac disease, with its resultant renal involvement, is frequently encountered;
and running, as it does, a chronic course, it offers an almost ideal field
<span class="pagenum" title="384"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a></span>of exploitation for the typical nostrum vender. By a typical nostrum vender
we mean one whose knowledge of his product is far below that of his appreciation
of a certain element of human character. On this element rests the
whole secret of the nostrum vender’s success. It is variously termed credulity,
gullibility and childlike simplicity, but it is that which often causes even the
most conscientious clinician to turn aside from the use of the best known and
most dependable drugs at his command, in the face of disappointment and
failure, and employ some vaunted mixture which, in his saner moments, he
scorns to use.</p>

<p>Anedemin is said to consist of a “Scientific Combination of three of the
more recently investigated members of the Digitalis Series, with Sambucus”;
that is, of apocynum, strophanthus and squill with elder. It is difficult to
know just what idea the statement that it is a “scientific combination” of these
drugs is intended to convey, for it is unscientific to mix three drugs of this
group for use in fixed proportion in a wide range of conditions, if indeed,
there is ever any indication for their use.</p>

<p>The great disadvantages of strophanthus and apocynum pertain to the
extreme uncertainty of their absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract.
Strophanthus is occasionally absorbed promptly, sometimes so slowly that the
therapeutic effects are not induced until an amount equal to several times
that which would prove fatal if all of it were absorbed into the circulation
has been administered, and, unfortunately, one cannot control the absorption
which may continue until a fatal effect is induced. This is true to an even
greater degree of apocynum, and it was due to the recognition of this fact
that apocynum was not admitted to the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia IX, the committee
on dosage having agreed that no safe and effective dose could be given.</p>


<h5>THE COUNCIL’S PREVIOUS FINDINGS</h5>

<p>In 1907 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry examined the literature
used in the exploitation of Anasarcin and Anedemin and published its report.
Anasarcin tablets, it was pointed out, were said to contain the active principles
of <i>Oxydendron arboreum</i> (sour wood), <i>Sambucus canadensis</i> (elder) and
<i>Urginea scilla</i> (squill), and the following claims were made for the nostrum:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Does what dropsy medicaments have hitherto failed to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“Superior to digitalis, strophanthus, scoparius, squills, acetate of potash and the hydragogue
cathartics all put together.”</p>

<p>“The only known relief and permanent cure of dropsies.”</p>

<p>“Unrivaled heart tonic.”</p>

<p>“The most powerful agent known.”</p>

<p>“Safe in administration.”</p>

<p>“Non-toxic as ordinarily administered.”</p>

<p>“Will nauseate some persons,” but “the reaction from the temporary depression is prompt.”</p>

<p>“In Bright’s disease, both the interstitial and parenchymatous forms of nephritis, acute or
chronic, no remedy <span class="ell">..</span>. to equal it in efficacy.”</p>

<p>“Without increasing the debility of the patient or interfering with nutrition by producing
loss of appetite&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>“This treatment is to be continued without cessation until all symptoms of dropsy have
disappeared.”</p></div>

<p>A comparison of the earlier claims with those now being made (see advertisement
reproduced from the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>) illustrates one of
the results of the work of the Council. Today the nostrum exploiter avoids
the cruder forms of obvious misstatement, but continues to make, by inference,
claims that are equally misleading. It will be observed in this case that a
more cautious pen worded the later advertisement, but there is still evident
the intent to convince the reader that Anasarcin is superior to the official drugs
in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The facts are that Anasarcin is
at best a dangerous remedy in the hands of the average clinician in the treatment
of such conditions, and its use is at all times to be condemned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="385"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a></span></p>
<p>No competent investigator has ever investigated the pharmacology of sour
wood (<i>Oxydendron arboreum</i>), and it appears to have no therapeutic value other
than that due to a slight acidulousness. Elder (<i>Sambucus canadensis</i>) contains
a trace of a volatile oil as its most important constituent, according to the
British Pharmaceutical Codex of 1911 (p.&nbsp;908), but it is difficult to explain
why a trace of volatile oil should be considered important. Elder may be
dismissed without further consideration in connection with Anasarcin tablets.</p>


<h5>THE PHARMACOLOGY OF SQUILL</h5>

<p>This leaves only squill among the constituents of Anasarcin for consideration.
Sollmann (Manual of Pharmacology, 1917, p.&nbsp;409) in discussing
the advantages claimed for squill over other drugs of the digitalis group, says:
“Dixon, 1906, points out that any superiority is outweighed by its disadvantages:
uncertain absorption; strong gastro-intestinal irritation.” Squill was formerly
used as an expectorant and diuretic, the activity having been attributed to
two amorphous glucosids, scillipicrin and scillitoxin, but Ewins, 1911, found
these to be impure mixtures. A later investigator claimed to have isolated
two glucosidal agents from squill, but similar claims have often been made
only to be disproved later, and we know of no confirmation of the claims
regarding the isolation of any pure principles from squill having any true
typical digitalis action.</p>

<p>The statement quoted from Sollmann is accepted by practically all pharmacologists,
and we may say with certainty that squill is decidedly inferior
to digitalis in the treatment of cardiovascular, and cardiorenal diseases, and
certainly no active principles of squill were known to the scientific world at
a time that the remarkable claims were first made for Anasarcin by an obscure
pharmacist of Winchester, Tenn. Indeed, if Anasarcin were all that it was
claimed to be, its discovery would have made Winchester as famous as a
certain Wisconsin city was said to have been made by a popular beverage.</p>

<p>It has been abundantly demonstrated, and it is now almost universally
accepted among well informed pharmacologists and clinicians, that all digitalis
principles exert the same kind of action on the heart after they enter the
circulation in effective doses, though they differ to an extraordinary degree
in the intensity of their action and in their undesired sideactions, such as
nausea and vomiting. When the use of Anasarcin (squill) is followed by
immediate improvement after digitalis has failed, it merely shows that the
dosage of digitalis was insufficient or that it was discontinued and the squill
mixture was substituted before the full therapeutic effects of the digitalis
developed.</p>


<h5>WHEN THE DIGITALIS GROUP IS CONTRAINDICATED</h5>

<p>If the administration of a sufficient dose of digitalis is not followed by
improvement in the circulation, it shows that the heart is incapable of responding
to such treatment and the further use of any of the drugs of this group is
distinctly contraindicated. This is confirmed by the experience of nearly every
competent observer of digitalis therapy, and numerous fatalities have resulted
from the failure to appreciate this fact and further administer some other
member of the group, such as strophanthus or squill.</p>

<p>It is now well known that the cardiac effects of toxic doses of squill, and
other members of the group, resemble closely those of cardiac disease, and it
is often impossible to determine whether the behavior of the heart in a given
case is attributable to insufficient dosage, to excessive dosage, or to the progress
of the cardiac disease itself. If this occurs when one uses the best
known members of the group, it is certain that it occurs even more frequently
when others that are less understood are employed. In the light of this knowledge
of the dangers attending the incautious use of any member of the digitalis
<span class="pagenum" title="386"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a></span>group, and more especially the use of impure principles, such as are commonly
obtained from squill, it is impossible to condemn sufficiently the recommendation
that the use of Anasarcin should be continued without cessation until all
symptoms of dropsy have disappeared.</p>

<p>Digitalis bodies are not suited for the treatment of all cardiac disturbances,
and it is, of course, self-evident that a time must come in the treatment of
chronic cardiac disease when the heart is incapable of responding to any
form of treatment with improvement. But, unfortunately, it never loses its
response to toxic doses, and to push the administration of any drug or mixture
containing any drug of the entire digitalis group&mdash;and especially those, like
squill, in which the side actions are most prominent&mdash;beyond the point of tolerance
is to court certain disaster.</p>


<h5>THE TREATMENT OF CARDIAC DROPSY</h5>

<p>While it is quite certain that many lives have been sacrificed to the failure
to understand this phase of cardiac therapy, it is equally certain that many
lives have been sacrificed because of insufficient dosage, and one can steer a
safe course between these dangers only by using the best known preparation
available; and in the present state of our knowledge it is indisputable that
digitalis and the tincture of digitalis are best suited for the treatment of
cardiac disease except in those few cases in which intramuscular or intravenous
administration must be employed temporarily for immediate effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/386.jpg" width="375" height="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The secret of prescribing successfully for the relief of dropsy in cardiac
disease consists in understanding the effects of digitalis on the heart, in
administering it until these effects indicate that the desired object has been
obtained, and stopping, or interrupting, the administration at that point until
the effects begin to wear off. Cumulation, so called, is a positive advantage
in such cases. It merely means that the desired therapeutic effects once induced
persist for a time, and that further medication is unnecessary during such persistence
of action. Eggleston has recently shown (<i>Arch. Int. Med.</i> <b>16</b>:1 [July]
1915; abstr., <i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>44</b>:459 [July 31] 1915) that the full therapeutic effects
of digitalis can be induced in suitable cases within a few hours even with
oral administration.</p>

<p>We are not aware of a single publication in which a careful, detailed
clinical study of Anasarcin has been reported. The claims made for Anasarcin,
<span class="pagenum" title="387"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a></span>past and present, indicate either a deliberate purpose to mislead or crass ignorance
of the rudiments of pharmacology and therapeutics. The exploiters of
the nostrum claim that thousands of physicians have found Anasarcin tablets
of unsurpassed remedial value in the treatment of disorders of the circulatory
system and of ascitic conditions<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_244_255" id="FNanchor_244_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_255" class="fnanchor">244</a></span> It must be admitted that too many physicians
have prescribed Anasarcin, otherwise the manufacturers would not have
continued to spend thousands of dollars in advertising it in medical journals
during a period of more than ten years.</p>

<p>Doctor, this article is meant to be a candid discussion with you, whether
you use Anasarcin or not, because every clinician is vitally interested in the
customs that obtain in the practice of medicine, and we wish to put a hypothetic
question to you. Answer it, at least to yourself, in exactly the spirit in which
it is put. Suppose that you prescribe Anasarcin for a patient who is critically
ill with cardiac disease. He dies. Are you willing to tell the relatives frankly
just what you used and the nature of the evidence on which you based your
choice of this nostrum? Let the supposition be carried further and say that
the case was hopeless, and agree that digitalis and all other drugs would have
been equally ineffective. Granting all this, would your explanation satisfy?
Would you in all candor dare to offer such an explanation? Try it as a
hypothetic case before you are forced to apply it.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 8, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">Article III</span>]</h3>

<h4>Pepto-Mangan</h4>


<p>It would be interesting, and even instructive, to know how many educated
physicians, if any, are now prescribing Pepto-Mangan (Gude): interesting as
indicating the number who have neglected to avail themselves of the work
of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, especially the earlier work;
instructive in that it would show how many are still prescribing by the rule
of thumb, and who are taking their therapeutic instructions from purely commercial
sources instead of striving to learn how to choose those drugs that
are most effective in the treatment of disease.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out many times in the pages of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> that many
nostrums are advertised first to physicians, and that after physicians have
served as the unpaid agents of the manufacturers in introducing the preparations,
their exploitation is then commonly continued by means of advertisements
in the public press. This plan has been followed successfully in so
many cases that we have now come to look on it as the regular course. It is
in keeping with this rule that we find Pepto-Mangan now advertised in the
public press, the physicians having served the manufacturer’s purpose.</p>


<h5>DISCARDED THEORIES OF IRON MEDICATION</h5>

<p>It will be recalled that many years ago the theory was held that hydrogen
sulphid (sulphureted hydrogen) interfered with the absorption of the iron of
the food, and that the administration of medicinal iron prevented this interference
by neutralizing the hydrogen sulphid (sulphureted hydrogen). It was
only a short step to argue that manganese might replace the medicinal iron
in combining with the hydrogen sulphid, permitting the food iron to be absorbed,
<span class="pagenum" title="388"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a></span>and it was held that only food iron could be utilized in the formation of
hemoglobin.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that this theory rests on numerous
fallacies. There is no hydrogen sulphid worth mentioning in the small
intestine where iron is absorbed; food iron cannot be utilized directly in the
formation of hemoglobin but must be broken into simple forms for absorption;
and, further, inorganic iron, such as ferrous carbonate, serves the purpose
admirably when iron is indicated. With the acceptance of these well established
facts, all possible excuse for the therapeutic employment of Pepto-Mangan
in place of iron vanished; but as plain and simple as this fact is, the
unnecessary and expensive Pepto-Mangan continues to be prescribed by physicians
who will not take the slight trouble to investigate the claims for this
nostrum.</p>


<h5>FALSE AND MISLEADING CLAIMS</h5>

<p>There is not merely a difference of opinion between the exploiters and the
Council, but there has been also actual misrepresentation in the exploitation
of this nostrum to physicians. This has been shown on more than one occasion.
About twelve years ago, the M.&nbsp;J. Breitenbach Company, the proprietors
of Pepto-Mangan, claimed that the report of the commission that had
been appointed for the investigation of anemia in Porto Rico “would alone
suffice to establish Pepto-Mangan at once as the foremost hematinic known.”
Examination of the report showed that the commission made no such claims;
on the contrary the commission protested against this misrepresentation
(<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>45</b>:1099 [Oct. 7] 1905).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/388.jpg" width="375" height="279" alt="" />
<p class="tac">From the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Undaunted by this exposure of their methods, the Breitenbach Company
later sent out a statement of results purporting to have been obtained by one
Mateo M. Gillen, in the treatment of infantile anemia on Randall’s Island in
New York City. At the instance of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> the hospital records in these
cases were examined, and it was found that the pretended report was little
more than a tissue of falsehood (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>48</b>:1197 [April 6] 1907).</p>

<p>About two years ago the Council reported that while the statements just
referred to were no longer made, they had never been definitely admitted by
the Breitenbach Company to be erroneous, and that Pepto-Mangan was then
being exploited to the public indirectly. (Council Reports, 1914, p.&nbsp;121.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="389"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a></span></p>
<p>We reproduce an advertisement that has been appearing weekly in the
<i>New York Medical Journal</i> for several months. One can only suppose that
this advertisement was intended to mislead physicians, and it would be an
insult to the intelligence of the average reader to attempt any detailed discussion
of it, but enough has been said to show how misleading the statements
are. One should note particularly the advice&mdash;old as the nostrum business
itself&mdash;contained in the advertisement, to prescribe an original bottle. The
reason for such advice is simple. Experience has shown that when original
bottles are dispensed patients soon learn to buy the nostrum without consulting
the physician, for they shrewdly suspect that he knows no more about
the preparation than they, and that he gets his information from precisely
the same sources that are available to them. They are obviously right. In
truth, the physician who prescribes Pepto-Mangan as a hematinic shows ignorance
of the most rudimentary facts of iron therapy, and the intelligent patient
soon perceives his limitations.</p>

<h5>THE PROBLEM OF IRON THERAPY</h5>

<p>The investigation of the problems of iron therapy and its utilization in
the formation of hemoglobin forms one of the most brilliant chapters in
pharmacologic research, and there is no better established fact in therapeutics
than that any organic or inorganic preparation of iron that does not irritate
the stomach may be employed effectively when the administration of iron is
indicated. “Useful Drugs” contains a list of iron preparations that are suitable
<span class="pagenum" title="390"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a></span>for all conditions which call for iron, and the clinician may rest assured that
he will never have occasion to go outside that list to prescribe any substitute.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it seems probable that the very number of available
iron preparations has served to cause confusion, thus affording an opportunity
for the nostrum maker to introduce his superfluous compounds. It may be
difficult at times to select the preparation of iron best suited to the individual
patient; and it is this difficulty that has led the clinician to listen to the
seductive claims made for the various pretended substitutes for iron. One
should approach the question of choosing the proper form of iron for therapeutic
use with the recognition of the fact that there is no such thing as a
substitute for iron in the formation of hemoglobin, that there are no ideal
forms of iron other than those found in the foodstuffs. Further, the clinician
cannot avoid the disadvantages inherent in all forms of iron that he can
prescribe, and he must therefore seek that which seems best suited for the
individual patient.</p>

<p>Bunge estimated the amounts of iron present in various foods; and a table
based on this, and other data, is given in “Pharmacology of Useful Drugs”
(published by the American Medical Association). Ordinary foods in an
ample diet contain enough iron to supply the normal daily loss, which amounts
to only a few milligrams, but many persons who have poor appetites take an
insufficient amount of iron in their food and become anemic. In such cases
the additional iron required can be supplied best by adding spinach, eggs,
apples, or other iron-rich food to the dietary.</p>


<h5>SOME IRON COMBINATIONS</h5>

<p>William Hunter discusses the subject of anemia and its treatment at considerable
length in the “Index of Treatment,” Ed.&nbsp;6, pp.&nbsp;17–37, and gives many
prescriptions containing iron for use under different conditions; and while it
is unnecessary to reproduce all of these here, a few may be given in order to
suggest suitable methods of prescribing iron when it cannot be given in
sufficient amounts in the food.</p>

<p>In chlorosis Hunter advises that that form of iron which experience has
shown to be least disturbing to the patient’s stomach should be used, and he
suggests separate stomachic mixtures to be used simultaneously, not mixed
with the iron itself. When constipation exists&mdash;and this is a very common
accompaniment of chlorosis&mdash;he gives the following aperient iron combination:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"></td><td class="tal"></td><td class="tac" colspan="2">Gm. or c.c.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal">℞&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Ferrous sulphate</span></div></td><td class="tal"></td><td class="tal">│25</td><td class="tal pl3">gr. iv</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>This, constituting a single dose, is to be taken twice daily&mdash;at 11&nbsp;a.&nbsp;m. and
6&nbsp;p.&nbsp;m. A little compound tincture of gentian and water may be used in place
of the compound infusion of the British Pharmacopeia. He modifies this
somewhat as occasion demands by using sodium sulphate and adding sodium
bicarbonate (which converts the sulphate of iron into ferrous carbonate) and
adds 10 minims of spirit of chloroform to act as a stomachic.</p>

<p>Hunter also suggests the use of pills of aloes and iron in place of the
mixture described above, and when constipation has been corrected, the aloes
may be omitted and the pill of ferrous carbonate alone may be used for the
iron. Hunter’s comment regarding this pill is, “very satisfactory.”</p>

<p>The same form of iron is available in the compound iron mixture, formerly
official, which Hunter says is exceedingly good. In this country the compound
solution of iron and ammonium acetate, Basham’s mixture, so called, has long
enjoyed a wide reputation as causing very little disturbance of the stomach,
<span class="pagenum" title="391"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></span>and the homely tincture of ferric chlorid is probably useful in a large majority
of cases in which the stomach is not especially irritable.</p>

<p>We may say with assurance that one of the forms suggested here will
suffice for practically every case in which it is necessary to reinforce the
amount of iron available in the food by some pharmaceutical preparation. If
these do not satisfy your requirements, consult a really competent pharmacist
and enlist his aid in devising a mixture especially suited to your individual
patient.&mdash;(<i>From the Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 29, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">Article IV</span>]</h3>

<h4>Cactina Pillets</h4>


<p>This preparation may be considered briefly in view of the recent discussion
in this series of articles of the pharmacology of the digitalis group and the
principles of treatment in cardiovascular disease. The manufacturers maintain
that cactina is wholly unlike digitalis, and that is the truth, as we shall
show; but since they claim that it is useful in certain conditions of the heart
in which digitalis is commonly employed by well informed clinicians, it is
necessary to consider its cardiac actions&mdash;or its lack of them! It is difficult
to determine just what action cactina is supposed to exert on the heart. For
example, one advertisement contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cactina Pillets. A gentle cardiac tonic that supports and sustains the heart through its
capacity to improve cardiac nutrition.”</p></div>

<p>Just how the cardiac nutrition is to be improved without an improved
coronary circulation is not explained. It would be interesting to know in
what other way this is to be accomplished, and how an improved coronary
circulation can be induced without acting on the heart or vessels. But that
is what digitalis does, and you should remember that cactina is so very different
from digitalis! Then again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cactina Pillets. A remedy that steadies and strengthens the heart by imparting tone to
the heart muscle.”</p></div>

<p>That is a pretty direct statement, but digitalis imparts tone; and we must
not forget that “cactina” is wholly unlike digitalis, and we are told that
“cactina” is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Invaluable in all functional cardiac disorders such as tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia,
and whenever the heart’s action needs regulating or support.”</p></div>

<p>If these are merely functional disorders of the heart, it is highly desirable
to know what are the symptoms of really serious cardiac disease! Since the
manufacturers give us no information concerning the mode of action of
“cactina” we will turn to the literature of disinterested observers. If one
attempts to discover the origin of “cactina,” he will probably meet with disappointment,
for various bibliographies fail to mention the name of Sultan,
who is said to have isolated “cactina” from <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i>. It seems
that Sultan worked with <i>Cactus</i>, or some other plant, when a student of pharmacy,
and it is to be remembered that Cactina Pillets are manufactured by
the Sultan Drug Company.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Sultan actually worked with genuine <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i>;
and, in fact, there is good reason for thinking that he did not, for all
subsequent workers who have taken pains to secure genuine <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i>
have failed to detect the presence of any active principle, except possible traces
that are of no therapeutic importance whatever.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="392"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a></span></p>

<h5>WHAT THE COUNCIL FOUND</h5>

<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry examined the literature relating
to cactus and certain proprietary preparations, including Cactina Pillets,
alleged to be made from cactus, and has reported the results of its investigation
(<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>54</b>:888 [March 12] 1910) and we will quote from that report.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The therapeutic value of this plant has been variously estimated by
different observers. Experimental evidence as to its action is scanty and
no complete chemical examination has ever been made.</p>

<p>“Reputable men have testified that some of the plants of the cactus
family contain very active principles, but so far experiments seem to
prove that <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i> has neither the action of digitalis nor that
of strychnin. The principal contributions, clinical and experimental, for
and against the drug are set out below.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/392.jpg" width="405" height="302" alt="" />
<div>Typical advertisements of “Cactina Pillets” from the Medical Record and New York Medical
Journal, respectively.</div>
</div>

<p>The report then proceeds to analyze the work of O.&nbsp;H. Myers, R.&nbsp;A.
Hatcher, Boinet and Boy-Teissier, Sayre, Gordon Sharp, S.&nbsp;A. Matthews,
P.&nbsp;W. Williams, Aulde and Ellingwood, and comes to conclusions that are set
forth as follows, in brief:</p>

<p>1. It is uncertain what part of the plant contains the active principle, if
any such principle exists.</p>

<p>2. Part of the experimental and clinical work has been published under
proprietary auspices.</p>

<p>3. The value of clinical evidence when unsupported by animal experimentation
is much diminished by the tendency of enthusiastic and untrained
observers to attribute to the drug given the effect really due to general remedial
measures, psychic suggestion and so forth.</p>

<p>In other words, the literature does not afford a report of a single piece of
careful painstaking work the results of which lend support to the claims made
for Cactina Pillets as stated above, for it is obvious that if <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i>
contains no active principle, no active principle can be extracted from it.
<span class="pagenum" title="393"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a></span>Some time after the report of the Council was published, Hatcher and Bailey
secured genuine <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i> directly from a competent botanist, Dr.
C.&nbsp;A. Purpus, of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and studied it experimentally. They
reported (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>56</b>:26 [Jan. 7] 1911) in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have been unable to obtain any evidence that the true Mexican
<i>Cactus grandiflorus</i> possesses any pharmacologic action whatever; but, on the
contrary, it appears to be a singularly inert substance when administered
either by the mouth or by the vein.”</p></div>

<p>When colossal doses of <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i> are given by the vein, they
sometimes&mdash;but not always&mdash;appear to exert an extremely feeble action on
the heart; but this action is so slight that its nature could not be determined.
Even the most colossal doses of <i>Cactus grandiflorus</i> administered by the mouth
to cats, dogs and frogs exert no perceptible effect.</p>

<p>Sollmann thus satirizes the absurd claims made by the exploiters of proprietary
forms of cactus: “Should the heart be too slow, cactus quickens it;
if the heart is too fast, cactus slows it; should the heart be too weak, cactus
strengthens it; if the heart is too strong, cactus weakens it; does the heart
wobble, cactus steadies it; if the heart is normal, cactus does not meddle
with it” (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>51</b>:52 [July 4] 1908).</p>

<p>Will physicians continue to accept the statements of an interested nostrum
vender&mdash;who submits not a shred of evidence to support his claims, but who
has a financial interest in convincing them&mdash;even when his statements are
diametrically opposed to all the evidence that the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry has been able to secure?&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 19, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">Article V</span>]</h3>

<h4>Ammonol and Phenalgin</h4>


<p>At the time that synthetic chemical drugs were coming into fame and
when every manufacturer who launched a new headache mixture claimed to
have achieved another triumph in synthetic chemistry, Ammonol and Phenalgin
were born. Of course, these twins of analgesic pseudotherapy were claimed
to be synthetics and were duly christened with “formulas.” They were among
the first of the nostrums examined for the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry,
and the false claims made for them were exposed.</p>

<p>The analyses made for the Council showed that Ammonol and Phenalgin
were simple mixtures, having the following composition:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr class="fs80"><td class="tal"></td><td class="tac pall0306">ACETANILID</td><td class="tac pall0306">SODIUM&nbsp;BICARBONATE</td><td class="tac pall0306">AMMONIUM&nbsp;CARBONATE</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal smcap pr2">Ammonol</td><td class="tac">50</td><td class="tac">25</td><td class="tac">20</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal smcap pr2">Phenalgin</td><td class="tac">57</td><td class="tac">20</td><td class="tac">10</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The reports of the Council on, and numerous references to, these two
nostrums may be found in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of various dates<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_245_256" id="FNanchor_245_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_256" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> The reports will
prove interesting to those who are not familiar with, or have forgotten, the
methods of nostrum exploiters at the time the Council was formed. Following
the Council’s exposure of the false claims made by the manufacturers of
Phenalgin, the <i>Medical Record</i> published an advertisement of that nostrum in
which an attempt was made to discredit the Council’s report. The editor of
the <i>Medical Record</i> was requested by the Council to publish the facts in the
case but he refused to do so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="394"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a></span></p>
<p>Long after the death of Dr. Cyrus Edson, the claim was made that
Phenalgin was made under his direction and that it was his “discovery.” As
a matter of fact, Dr. Edson had favored the use of Ammonol at one time,
and when the Council exposed the false claims then being made for Phenalgin,
The Journal charged that a fraud was being perpetrated on the medical profession.
Despite the exposure of the methods used in exploiting Ammonol and
Phenalgin, one finds just as glaringly false statements made in the advertisements
of Phenalgin today as were made in its unsavory past. This would
seem to indicate either that physicians have short memories or that they are
strangely indifferent to the welfare of their patients, to their own reputations
and to the good name of medicine.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Medical Journal</i> of Dec. 22, 1917, contained an advertisement
of Phenalgin&mdash;it has been running for months&mdash;from which the following
is quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the relief of <span class="lowercase smcap">PAIN</span> the ‘logical supplanter of opium and other habit-forming drugs’ is
<span class="smcap">Phenalgin</span>. No matter how severe or where located pain is promptly and satisfactorily controlled
by this effective anodyne&mdash;and without disturbing the digestion, suppressing the secretions,
causing constipation or inducing a drug habit.</p>

<p>“This is why Phenalgin has superseded opium and its derivatives for relieving <span class="smcap">Headaches,
Rheumatism, Gout, La Grippe, Lumbago, Neuralgia, Disorders of the Female, Dysmenorrhea,
and Painful Conditions generally</span>. To thousands of physicians Phenalgin
‘is the one dependable analgesic&mdash;the logical supplanter of opium.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>If we are to suppose that the composition of Phenalgin is today essentially
the same as when it was examined, the claims just quoted are obviously false
for, of course, such a mixture must have the properties of acetanilid with all
of its drawbacks and limitations. We may contrast the statements made in
the advertisement just quoted with those made in Bulletin 126 of the Bureau
of Chemistry of the U.&nbsp;S. Department of Agriculture. This bulletin on “The
Harmful Effects of Acetanilid, Antipyrin and Phenacetin” summarizes the
replies received from 400 physicians to whom a questionnaire had been sent.
The information thus gained was tabulated and the figures that follow are
from these tables. There were reported no fewer than 614 cases of poisoning
by acetanilid with 16 deaths and 112 cases of its habitual use. The larger
number of cases of poisoning followed the administration of the drug, by
physicians, in doses larger than those now regarded as fairly safe. This
large number reported by only 400 physicians indicated an excessively large
number in the whole country. Since the questionnaire was sent to nearly a
thousand physicians, of whom about 500 failed to reply, it may be assumed
that had it been sent to the entire 130,000 physicians in the country, at least
75,000 cases of poisoning would have been reported.</p>

<p>Prior to the passage of the federal Food and Drugs Act (the “Pure Food
Law”) many nostrum makers had declared that their preparations contained
no acetanilid. When that law went into effect, some of these manufacturers
triumphantly pointed to the fact that they were still able to make the same
claim without conflicting with the requirements of the law. This was accomplished
in fact by changing the formula and substituting acetphenetidin
(phenacetin) for the acetanilid. While acetphenetidin is somewhat less toxic
than acetanilid, bulk for bulk, the toxicity and therapeutic activity of the
two drugs are nearly proportional.</p>

<p>The claim made by many proprietary medicine manufacturers that they
are “strictly ethical” because they advertise only to physicians is mere verbal
camouflage. There may be no more certain way of insuring the continued
use of a nostrum by the public than to have it prescribed by physicians; and
none know this better than the makers of nostrums. A proprietary individuality
is obtained by giving some special form to the tablets and package or a
special coloring to the capsules (“Specify ‘Phenalgin Pink Top Capsules’&#8239;”)
<span class="pagenum" title="395"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a></span>so as to indicate the identity of the products in such a way that the patient
may in the future procure them without the advice or warning of the physician.
When a proprietary preparation with the name or initials stamped on it or
attached to it is prescribed, the patient immediately is aware of the fact, and
his respect for the physician’s intelligence and wisdom is naturally lessened.</p>

<p>The physician should never place such dangerous drugs as acetanilid and
acetphenetidin, or ready made mixtures of them, in the hands of the patient
in such a way that they can be employed without his supervision or control.
He should never prescribe more than is needed at the time and should not
form the habit of using fixed doses or combinations of drugs without a special
reference to the particular needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Certain forms of headache yield more readily to a mixture of caffein and
acetanilid or caffein and acetphenetidin than to either acetanilid or acetphenetidin
alone. When the physician wishes to prescribe such a mixture he may
combine 1 grain of caffein or 2 grains of citrated caffein with 3 grains of
acetanilid or 4 grains of acetphenetidin in a powder or capsule. Under supervision
such a dose may be repeated at intervals of from two to four hours
if necessary to control pain. It is necessary to remember, however, that
when small doses fail to give relief, increase in the dose is useless. This
fact is especially important, and disregard or ignorance of it has been responsible
for many cases of poisoning. Further, it should be remembered that while
it was taught for many years that the admixture of caffein with acetanilid
lessened the effect of the latter drug on the heart, Hale has shown that this
is not the case and such mixtures must be used with special caution.&mdash;(<i>From

<h4>Fellows’ Syrup, and Other Preparations of the Hypo­phosphites</h4>


<p>We hope that it is clear to those who have read the several articles of
this series that their purpose is to present evidence that will enable the reader
to form a correct estimate of the literature employed in the exploitation of
various nostrums. The distinction between mere assertion&mdash;however plausible,
and from however eminent an authority&mdash;and evidence should again be
emphasized. Satisfactory evidence rests on careful observation by those who
are capable of accurately determining to what extent any changes that may
be observed are due to the therapeutic agent employed and not mere accompaniments
of such treatment.</p>

<p>When the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry was organized in 1905, the
greater part of the literature of the nostrums was so palpably misleading, the
statements often so ludicrously false, that it was only necessary to call attention
to this fact to have those claims collapse. As a result of the Council’s
work, the exploiters of worthless nostrums have developed a greater degree
of shrewdness in avoiding the easily exploded falsehoods. This has made it
increasingly difficult to point out the exact statements on which many of the
false claims now rest, even though the exploitation as a whole is as inherently
dishonest as before. If a nostrum is worthless, any exploitation must be false
and misleading in effect, even though not one single false direct statement
is made.</p>

<p>A platitude may be given an appearance of importance if uttered in an
impressive manner, and it may be employed to suggest far more than it categorically
affirms. These two facts are appreciated by many nostrum exploiters
and we find that they have adopted the impressive manner to secure attention,
and the platitude to suggest far more than they could defend in direct statement.
Thus we have the “lie with circumstance.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="396"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a></span></p>

<h5>FELLOWS’ SYRUP</h5>

<p>A full page advertisement, which has been appearing regularly for about
a year and which must represent a good deal of money, is used to give an
appearance of importance to a few words which, if printed in ordinary type,
would either pass wholly unnoticed or would lead one to assume that something
essential to the full meaning had been omitted. The statement, in full
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fellows’ Syrup differs from other preparations of the hypo­phosphites. Leading clinicians
in all parts of the world have long recognized this important fact. Have you? To insure
results, prescribe the genuine ℞ Syr. Hypophos. Comp. Fellows’. Reject cheap and inefficient
substitutes. Reject preparations ‘just as good.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>The only direct statement contained in the advertisement is to the effect
that many clinicians have observed that Fellows’ syrup and other preparations
of the hypo­phosphites are not alike. In truth, Fellows’ is not like the better
preparations of this type, since after standing it contains a muddy looking
deposit that any pharmaceutical tyro would be ashamed of. Technically, then,
the statement is true, but it is hardly credible that the manufacturer is paying
for an entire page in a medical journal to make this statement without any
attempt to suggest something else.</p>

<p>The advertising pages of six medical journals were examined in the order
in which they chanced to come to hand. In five of these, the entire advertisement
of Fellows’ syrup was in the words just quoted; not a single word more.
In one there was the further statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not a new-born prodigy or an untried experiment, but a remedy whose usefulness has
been fully demonstrated during half a century of clinical application.”</p></div>

<p>These advertisements show that the exploiters of Fellows’ Syrup are spending
a great deal of money to induce physicians to prescribe the preparation,
and it is equally evident that they wish to convey the impression that the
preparation has some therapeutic value. Since we find nothing directly false,
in the first mentioned advertisement at least, we must take the evident intent
for consideration and determine what therapeutic value, if any, this preparation
has, and whether it is advisable for physicians to employ it in any case.</p>

<p>The preparation, according to the statement just cited, has been in use
for fifty years. As the exploiter of any preparation cites the most convincing
evidence in his possession in support of his views, this claim may be assumed
to be the strongest available, and if this evidence fails we must reject the
contention as not proved. Here we face a dilemma, for examination of the
literature used in the exploitation of Fellows’ Syrup fails to disclose any
evidence of the kind that we have described as satisfactory; and we are, therefore,
forced to conclude that none has ever been found. By this it is not to be
implied that no reputable physician has ever reported favorably concerning
the therapeutic effects of this preparation. It is quite possible that an extensive
literature of that sort might be found if one examined the older medical journals.
But the day has passed when every improvement that follows the
administration of a preparation is blindly attributed to the drug in question.
Clinical research today is far more exacting.</p>

<p>We will assume that the reader who has investigated the question with an
open mind will have come to the decision that the contention that Fellows’
syrup is of especial therapeutic value is not proved. We might rest with that
assumption and ask the clinician whether he is prepared to use a nostrum
that has been before the medical profession for half a century without any
satisfactory evidence having been gained that it possesses therapeutic value.
We might ask him whether he would be willing to tell his patients that he
<span class="pagenum" title="397"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a></span>was prescribing such a nostrum for them in the face of the absence of any
such evidence of its value.</p>


<h5>THE INERTNESS OF THE HYPOPHOSPHITES</h5>

<p>But we prefer to go even further and show him that not only is there an
entire absence of any evidence of its therapeutic value so far as we have been
able to learn, but in addition there is an abundance of evidence that the hypo­phosphites
are devoid of any such therapeutic effect as they were formerly
reputed to have, and that, in fact, they are, so far as any effect based on their
phosphorus content is concerned, singularly inert.</p>

<p>While we have thus far taken the Fellows’ preparation as the subject of
the discussion, we may take a broader view and examine the subject of the
hypo­phosphites in general, and the substitutes containing phosphorus that have
been introduced from time to time. It hardly needs to be said that if the
hypo­phosphites are without therapeutic value, it is impossible to give them
value by combining them in a muddy-looking, ill-made preparation such as
Fellows’ Syrup. Such evidence was submitted to the medical profession in a
report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry (<i>J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i> <b>67</b>:760
[Sept. 2] 1916); and we would strongly advise any one who is disposed to
act on the suggestion contained in the advertisements of Fellows’, and other
hypo­phosphite preparations, to read that report in full and to think the matter
over before prescribing one of these nostrums. Quoting briefly from the report
in question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although the overwhelming weight of evidence was against the probability
that the hypo­phosphite preparations are of value as therapeutic agents, the
Council thought it well to investigate the subject. Dr. W. McKim Marriott
of Baltimore was therefore requested to review the evidence for and against
the therapeutic usefulness of the hypo­phosphites and to conduct such experiments
as seemed necessary.”</p></div>

<p>The Council was not content to rest on the mere absence of evidence for
the value of these preparations or any one of them, but sought to obtain evidence
that would fulfil the conditions mentioned above, and in pursuance of
this plan it secured the cooperation of a trained investigator, one who would
work under the best of conditions for learning the truth. The results of Dr.
Marriott’s investigation were published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 12, 1916, p.&nbsp;486,
and should be read by everyone who has any interest in the problem. Lest
some of our readers may fail to refer to the original of Marriott’s paper, we
will quote briefly from it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“None of the subjects of the experiment experienced any effect whatsoever
from the administration of the drug <span class="ell">..</span>. Almost all of the ingested hypo­phosphite
is eliminated unchanged<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“These experiments (Forbes) demonstrate conclusively that the hypo­phosphites
possess no specific value as a source of phosphorus for the body<span class="ell">...</span>.
It is doubtful if there are any conditions in which the body suffers from lack
of phosphorus. Even should such conditions exist, phosphorus, in the form
that it occurs in the ordinary foods, or as phosphates, is more efficient in supplying
the deficit than hypo­phosphites that must be oxidized before utilization
and which are only about 15 per cent. oxidized if at all. For example, half a
glass of milk contains more available phosphorus than three large doses of
hypo­phosphites of 15 grains each, as great a dosage as is usually given.</p>

<p>“What then, is the therapeutic value of hypo­phosphites? There is no reliable
evidence that they exert a physiologic effect; it has not been demonstrated
that they influence any pathologic process; they are not ‘foods.’ If they are
of any use, that use has never been discovered.”</p></div>

<p>The case seems to stand about like this: A nostrum maker spends thousands
of dollars to tell physicians that his cloudy preparation is not like other preparations,
<span class="pagenum" title="398"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a></span>and physicians are expected to accept that as convincing evidence that they
should prescribe and their patients, perforce, take it. This too, in spite of
the evidence gained by careful scientific investigators that the hypo­phosphites
in fairly large doses contain less available phosphorus than half a glass of
milk, and that there is no evidence available that they exert any therapeutic
effects at all.</p>

<p>Should we take the meaningless statement of a nostrum maker, who does
not submit evidence of any therapeutic value of his preparation&mdash;unless one
can call certain careless habits of prescribing evidence&mdash;and assume the responsibility
of prescribing a nostrum that according to all scientific evidence
available is useless, and of no more effect than a few teaspoonfuls of milk, so
far as its hypo­phosphite content is concerned? It may be argued that it
possesses some value because of its bitter nature. We will not deny that it
is bitter; so is strychnin, so is quinin, so are scores of simple drugs, but what
physician would care to admit to his patients that he did not know how to
prescribe a simple bitter, such as nearly every layman can select for himself,
without recourse to a preparation such as Fellows’ Syrup?</p>

<p>We have felt that it is not wholly satisfactory to discourage the use of a
given nostrum without making an effort to assist the physician in choosing
wisely in the treatment of the condition for which the nostrum is claimed to
be useful. In the present instance, however, we fear that would prove a task
beyond our powers, for the hypo­phosphites have been used in such a variety
of conditions that the discussion would have to include nearly the whole
materia medica if we were to follow our usual procedure.&mdash;(<i>From the Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Feb. 16, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h4>Shotgun Nostrums</h4>


<p>Formerly it was customary to prescribe mixtures of many drugs on the
assumption that if one of the ingredients missed the mark another might be
expected to hit it, just as a poor marksman is more likely to hit a target at
short range with a blunderbuss than with a high powered rifle. Increased
precision in every branch of science has become the outstanding feature of
civilization. The soldier today must shoot straight with a rifle that sends a
single ball. There is none of the disposition to rely on chance as when the
blunderbuss was used. A capable physician directs his drug straight at the
seat of the trouble, and we now have many drugs that can be depended on to
exert definite actions. The complex mixture is just as preposterous in modern
therapeutics as the blunderbuss would be on a modern battlefield.</p>

<p>Every drug exerts undesired side actions, and it is the aim of the modern
physician to try to select the one which will have a maximum of therapeutic
with a minimum of undesired actions. When a complex mixture is employed,
it is obvious that only the best is utilized, whereas all the undesired side
actions come into play. We do not pretend that even the best studied drug
has not much to be learned about it; but the nostrum maker who exploits a
complex mixture either knows practically nothing of the side actions that
it will exert, or, if he knows, he conceals that knowledge. He knows that
massive doses of hydrated chloral combined with various narcotics can be
relied on to cause unconsciousness in nearly all cases, but he prefers to speak
of this as a hypnotic action. This is plain gambling with human life. When
the patient dies, it is difficult to prove that death was caused by the mixture
alone.</p>

<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry has expended a great deal of
time and energy in combating the “shotgun” nostrum evil. It is easy to
<span class="pagenum" title="399"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a></span>understand the disadvantages of such mixtures but it is not so easy to demonstrate
the misleading character of the claims made, with an entire disregard
of the truth, for these mixtures. No one believes that a pot of gold lies at
the end of the rainbow, but no one has actually gone there to see for himself.</p>


<h5>BROMIDIA</h5>

<p>There are many types of “shotgun” nostrum. Some are dangerous, as in
the case of “Bromidia”; some are preposterous, therapeutic monstrosities
which excite the contempt of educated physicians, as in the case of “Tongaline”;
some are merely useless mixtures of well known drugs, sold under grotesquely
exaggerated claims, as in the case of “Peacock’s Bromides.”</p>

<p>Various formulas have been given for Bromidia. The manufacturers appear
to be more cautious under those circumstances in which falsehood might lead
them into collision with the federal authorities, than when giving reign to
fancy and considering only the best means of winning the favor of the physician.
It is said to consist of hydrated chloral, potassium bromid, Indian
cannabis, and hyoscyamus. It is impossible to determine from the published
formulas just how much hydrated chloral and potassium bromid it contains,
but is probable that there are about 15 grains of each of these two drugs to the
fluidram, and variable amounts of Indian cannabis and a small amount of
either extract or tincture of hyoscyamus.</p>

<p>This much is certain: Bromidia is a distinctly dangerous mixture for
indiscriminate use. The claim of the manufacturers, implied, rather than
directly stated, that it is superior to an ex­tem­por­aneously prepared mixture
of those drugs is especially reprehensible because it tends to create the impression
that the nostrum is safer in effective doses, conducing to a false sense of
security on the part of those who are deluded into prescribing it in larger
doses than they would a mixture of the same drugs prepared ex­tem­por­aneously.</p>

<p>A report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry published in <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, May 16, 1914, p.&nbsp;1573, mentions three instances in which death is
reported to have followed the use of Bromidia. The manufacturers of Bromidia
have no magic power to render hydrated chloral harmless, while it retains its
hypnotic action. It depresses the central nervous system, and it is nothing
less than monstrous for any one to pretend to rob this drug of its dangerous
properties while it retains its hypnotic effects. If the patient requires a hypnotic,
the physician should choose that one which his judgment and experience
dictate as the best for that particular patient. If he needs hydrated chloral, the
physician should prescribe exactly as much as he believes the patient needs.
If the effect is slightly greater or slightly less than anticipated, no harm is
done and the physician has gained experience that will be valuable in future
prescribing. If Bromidia is prescribed and unexpected effects are induced,
it is impossible to know whether these were due to the hydrated chloral or to
one of the other narcotics or to a synergistic action; and there is nothing to
guide in the further use of the nostrum, for mixtures of narcotics commonly
have much less uniformity of action than a single drug.</p>

<p>The irritant action of hydrated chloral on the stomach can be avoided by
the use of bland fluids or dilute solutions. The following serves as an example
of the way in which it may be prescribed conveniently:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"></td><td class="tar" colspan="2">Gm. or c.c.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Hydrated chloral</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;2</td><td class="tal">│6</td><td class="tal pl3">gr. xl</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Syrup of orange peel</span></div></td><td class="tar"></td><td class="tal">│</td><td class="tal pl3"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Water of each</span></div></td><td class="tar">30</td><td class="tal">│</td><td class="tal pl3">fl ℥ i</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>A tablespoonful (15.0&nbsp;c.c.) of this mixture, containing 10 grains (0.65&nbsp;gm.)
of hydrated chloral, will often induce sleep in the absence of severe pain or
serious disturbance, and seldom does this dose have to be repeated more than
<span class="pagenum" title="400"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a></span>once in such simple cases. Hydrated chloral is often used in somewhat smaller
doses in combination with potassium bromid, which may be prescribed in a
mixture such as the following:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"></td><td class="tar" colspan="2">Gm. or c.c.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Hydrated chloral</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;1</td><td class="tal">│3</td><td class="tal pl3"><span class="ilb">gr.&nbsp;xx</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Potassium bromid</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;3</td><td class="tal">│9</td><td class="tal pl3"><span class="ilb">gr.&nbsp;lx</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Syrup of orange peel</span></div></td><td class="tar"></td><td class="tal">│</td><td class="tal pl3"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Water of each</span></div></td><td class="tar">30</td><td class="tal">│</td><td class="tal pl3"><span class="ilb">fl&nbsp;℥&nbsp;i</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In producing sleep when severe pain is absent this is as effective as the
preceding, in similar doses. The use of repeated doses of hydrated chloral in
such a mixture as this, or in the form of Bromidia or other nostrum when
sleeplessness is due to severe pain is highly dangerous. It should be remembered
that while hydrated chloral is an effective hypnotic in case of simple
sleeplessness, it is not actively analgesic except in distinctly dangerous doses.
Bromidia in repeated doses will induce sleep even in the presence of pain, of
course; but any active narcotic does that, and it is correspondingly dangerous.
Small doses of morphin given alone are preferable when sleeplessness is due to
severe pain.</p>


<h5>TONGALINE</h5>

<p>“Tongaline” is an example of the type of “shotgun” nostrum that would be
merely ludicrous if we could look on anything that degrades therapeutics so
lightly. A report was made to the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, and
published in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, July 17, 1915, p.&nbsp;269, and in this report it is stated that
Tongaline is said to consist of tonga, cimicifuga racemosa, sodium salicylate,
colchicum, and pilocarpin. Whether the formula was cut short just there
because the office boy ran out of breath at that point, or because the discoverers
of this wonderful combination had not heard of the eminently potent substances
that the witches added to their cauldron, we can leave to the reader’s imagination,
for it is manifestly impossible to present an orderly discussion of the
pharmacology and therapeutics of such a preposterous jumble of drugs.</p>


<h5>PEACOCK’S BROMIDES</h5>

<p>“Peacock’s Bromides” belongs to a slightly different class. It is said to
consist of the bromids of sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium and lithium.
In the absence of a logical explanation of the pretended superiority of this
mixture over one that is made ex­tem­por­aneously, the exploiters seem to have
been driven to the necessity of pretending that its freedom from contaminating
chlorids explains its claimed advantages over mixtures of the official or commercial
bromids. The truth is that the chlorids are used as antidotes in
bromid poisoning.</p>

<p>Disregard the claims made for Peacock’s Bromides, and ask yourself the
question whether you have ever actually seen any ill results following the
use of the official bromids that you could reasonably attribute to contaminating
chlorids. Furthermore, carefully consider the relative advantage of a single
bromid (say the bromid of potassium, or bromid of sodium, if you prefer it),
with the opportunity of observing its effects and adjusting the dose in accordance
with the results of your experience, and a mixture such as Peacock’s
Bromides, the composition of which you do not know, and which the manufacturer
can alter to suit his own convenience.</p>

<p>While it is true that the therapeutic art will not degenerate in its entirety
merely because some physicians continue to use the most fraudulent and worthless
nostrums, yet, on the other hand, to the extent that a physician continues
to be guided by the false teachings of nostrum venders who have no therapeutic
training, he is plunged into therapeutic chaos.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 2, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h4>Tyree’s Antiseptic and Aseptinol</h4>


<p>It may seem paradoxic to say that recent progress in the medical sciences
has made therapeutic chaos possible, but it is true nevertheless. Revolutions
are sometimes slow and orderly, sometimes sudden and attended with confusion.
The revolutionary changes in the medical sciences have been so numerous
and so rapid that the general practitioner has been unable to keep pace with
them, and in the resulting confusion the nostrum maker has seen his opportunity
for exploiting his useless, dangerous or unscientific preparations. The
greater the confusion, the greater his opportunity; and it is no exaggeration
to say that he has been the most potent factor in maintaining the chaos of
therapeutics.</p>

<p>The majority of our readers would probably say that the existing scientific
medical literature insures the permanence of established beliefs, but every
one who has delved into the literature has found instances of truths that had
been established and forgotten&mdash;buried under the ever-increasing avalanche
of contributions to that literature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/401.jpg" width="370" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="tac">Typical half-page Tyree advertisement appearing in medical journals.</p>
</div>

<p>Rapid advances are still being made in the medical sciences and unless
constant vigilance is exercised therapeutics will return to the chaotic condition
from which it has so recently emerged. It was in recognition of these facts&mdash;the
danger of this return to chaos, and the difficulty, in fact, impossibility, of
any individual’s keeping pace with all of the medical sciences&mdash;that the American
Medical Association secured the cooperation of men in various branches of
medicine in the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, in order that it may
place the results of therapeutic progress before the readers of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
in an impartial manner.</p>

<p>Are you profiting by this work, or are you still depending on your unaided
efforts to distinguish the false teachings of the nostrum venders from that
of scientific medicine? Are you prescribing “Antikamnia” and “Ammonol” or
a simple member of the group, such as acetanilid or phenacetin? Are you
depending on “Tyree’s Antiseptic,” so called, or are you using an antiseptic
about which there is no mystery, for which no false claims are made, and one
which is really effective? In short, are you using drugs of unquestioned value,
<span class="pagenum" title="402"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a></span>such as are described in “Useful Drugs,” or are you taking your therapeutic
instructions from nostrum makers’ circulars?</p>

<p>Perhaps you have been led to believe that the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry is composed of “theorists” and that the nostrums represent the
work of “practical men.” Every one should strive to be practical, of course,
and it is worth while to inquire whether scientific experimenters, who so largely
mold medical literature, should be termed theorists, or practical men. A
practical man practices that which is useful in the treatment of the sick, and
he must determine who is capable of furnishing him with a better materia
medica. A perusal of medical literature will convince any unbiased mind that
medical science progresses only by means of experiment, hence experimenters
must be considered the really practical men while those who cling to outworn
theories are really the “theorists.”</p>

<p>When Lister introduced antiseptic methods into surgery he inaugurated a
veritable revolution, which afforded the nostrum makers opportunities for
reaping rich harvests through the exploitation&mdash;under extraordinary claims&mdash;of
cheap mixtures of little, or no, value. There is no lack of antiseptics of
extraordinary activity in the test tube that are practically harmless to man,
and it would seem natural to suppose that such antiseptics could be used to
control the development of bacteria in such diseases as typhoid fever, but,
unfortunately, such hopes have not been fulfilled. Ehrlich experimented with
many phenol derivatives that showed decided antiseptic activity in the test
tube, in the hope that he might find some that could be used to combat such
common diseases as diphtheria and typhoid fever, but while many of these
are of low toxicity for man, he was unable to find even one that could be
used effectively in the treatment of any of these diseases. His discovery of
arsphenamin (“salvarsan”) resulted from quite another type of investigation.</p>

<p>Many practitioners lose sight of the essential difference between antiseptics
and disinfectants and employ antiseptics in cases in which only a disinfectant
action would be of value. An antiseptic does not destroy bacteria, it merely
inhibits their growth; and when it is diluted too much, it loses its effects and
the bacteria may begin to multiply as though no antiseptic had been used.
<span class="pagenum" title="403"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a></span>This is especially true after the use of weak antiseptics in the mouth. These
are soon diluted or removed by the saliva, and the bacteria continue to multiply
with only a momentary interruption at best; hence to advise the use of an
oral antiseptic as an effective means of treating diphtheria is little short of
criminal.</p>

<p>“Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder” was submitted to the Council nearly twelve
years ago. The label on the package stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This preparation is a scientific combination of borate of sodium, alumen, carbolic acid,
glycerin and the crystallized principles of thyme, eucalyptus, gaultheria and mentha in the
form of a powder.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/403.jpg" width="325" height="380" alt="" />
<div>One of the older newspaper advertisements of Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder.</div>
</div>

<p>A leaflet issued several years ago by the Aseptinol Manufacturing Company
states that “Pulv. Aseptinol Comp.” combines in an elegant form boric
acid, the salts of aluminum, crystallized phenol, and the active crystalline
principles of thymus, mentha and gaultheria.</p>

<p>A comparison of these formulas would justify the designation of the two
preparations as twins, but even one twin may have a wart where the other lacks
it. The formula of Pulv. Aseptinol Comp. given in the leaflet also includes
<i>Hydrastis canadensis</i>, but we believe that a wart should be quite as much of an
addition to the anatomy of man as the hydrastis is to this already preposterous
formula. Similar as the formulas of these two nostrums were said to be, the
general methods of exploiting them were even more similar. A partial list of
the diseases for which each has been recommended by its exploiters shows the
similarity of methods pursued:</p>

<p>We stated that the formula furnished by Tyree was that given above,
but the Council was never able to learn when Tyree actually employed the
formula except for advertising purposes; and analysis of the powder showed
that Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder was essentially a mixture of boric acid and
zinc sulphate, with insignificant amounts of odorous principles.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact brought out in the course of the consideration of the
preparation by the Council was that Tyree admitted that he had changed the
formula without having published the new one. The Council then showed
that a specimen of the “antiseptic” that had been kept in a retail drug store
for several years was essentially similar to that sold at the later date. Thus
it would seem that Mr. Tyree had been making his powder by one formula and
publishing an entirely different one for years before the Council published
the facts in the case.</p>

<p>If Tyree found it necessary to change the formula of his powder&mdash;if indeed,
he ever used the published formula&mdash;why did the Aseptinol Manufacturing
Company adopt it, or one so closely resembling it?</p>

<p>It is obvious that both of these twin nostrums are utterly unfit for treating
the various conditions for which they are or have been recommended; and in
view of the misrepresentation in one case, it is difficult to understand why it
should be taken as the model for the other. Do physicians believe that a
simple mixture of boric acid and zinc sulphate, or a mixture such as that given
in the formula of “Aseptinol” powder, is in any way superior to a prescription
such as any physician could write?</p>

<p>There is a far more important question to consider than the relative merits
of such nostrums and a prescription of the physician’s own devising. That
question is whether the medical profession is going to help perpetuate the
chaotic conditions that the use of such nostrums fosters or to assist in therapeutic
progress by maintaining its independence of such false teachers, and
seeking to aid in the establishment of a rational use of drugs and remedial
measures.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 30, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">Article IX</span>]</h3>

<h4>Neurosine and the Original Package Evil</h4>


<p>We called attention recently to the skill which the nostrum vender displays
in avoiding the particular thorn that pricks him, and his development of the
art of impressively saying, “Nothing in General,” as exemplified in the advertisements
of Fellows’ Syrup. Nostrum sellers are more canny than original;
and when once an idea finds lodgment with one of them, it is made to serve
many masters. Formerly exploiters of either vicious or worthless nostrums
were wont to boast that their preparations were exploited in a “strictly
ethical manner.” Recent perusal of as choice a lot of advertisements as can
be found in the most degraded of medical journals failed to disclose this claim
<span class="pagenum" title="405"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a></span>in a single instance, although the claim that a preparation is “advertised only
to physicians” is still common.</p>

<p>The advertisement of “Neurosine,” which we reproduce, was the first one
which came to our attention when we searched through some medical journals
for one that would illustrate a discussion of the “original package” evil. This
is the only reason for selecting Neurosine rather than another. Such half
page advertisements and others of similar size in various medical journals
cost a good deal of money and they presuppose that the Dios Chemical Company
is interested in having original bottles of Neurosine dispensed every
time that nostrum is prescribed.</p>

<p>Why should the firm have any such deep interest in seeing that an original
<i>bottle</i> gets to the patient? Why should it be necessary to do anything more
than see that the genuine <i>mixture</i> reaches the patient? Does it seem within
the bounds of reason that substitution is so commonly practiced by pharmacists
that this firm must go to large expense to prevent the substitution of spurious
mixtures for its product? Is dishonesty the rule among pharmacists? Common
sense rejects the plea as placing too great a strain on one’s credulity.
Obviously, then, the advertisement does not tell the whole truth, though it
does indeed tell exactly what the nostrum maker wishes to have done, that is,
to have only <i>original bottles</i> dispensed when physicians prescribe that nostrum.
The fact we have; the reason is not far to seek.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/405.jpg" width="375" height="309" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the pharmacist puts up an ordinary, nonproprietary prescription, the
patient gets no clue from the package as to the nature of the prescription
employed. But when an original bottle of Neurosine is dispensed, even though
the pharmacist puts his own prescription label on it, the patient sees the
difference at once and knows just why the usual prescription bottle was not
employed. He also knows that he can get the medicine with its original
wrapper or label by merely showing the bottle to the druggist, for the words
“Neurosine” and “Dios Chemical Co.” are blown in the glass. Here, then,
may be a plausible reason for desiring that only original bottles be dispensed.</p>

<p>You may ask, “What difference does it make if the patient does learn the
name of the nostrum, he must go to his physician for advice concerning its
use?” Having learned the name of the remedy that has been prescribed for
<span class="pagenum" title="406"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a></span>sleeplessness, let us say, he proceeds to use it whenever he imagines that he
needs it; and that need, real or imaginary, has a way of increasing in frequency.
As a result, the patient takes far more Neurosine than the physician would
think of permitting if the matter had not passed entirely beyond his control.</p>

<p>Not only has the patient acquired a dangerous habit of self-prescribing,
but he takes especial delight in recommending his favorite remedy to friends
whose symptoms, real and imaginary, seem to resemble his own. This offers
him an opportunity to prescribe with an air of authority. It was prescribed
for him by Dr. Blank, and it gave relief, <i>ergo</i> it may be depended on to give
relief to others! Thus is the basis laid for its general use by the laity, when
this process is multiplied sufficiently. The statement is susceptible of easy
proof by any one who cares to investigate the matter for himself. There is
probably no physician worthy of the name who will attempt to deny that the
promiscuous use of hypnotics and narcotics is dangerous, and certainly no careful
physician will deliberately place a narcotic in the hands of patients to be
used freely and without control.</p>

<p>Since we have selected Neurosine at random, so far as this particular
discussion is concerned, it is worth while to inquire into its composition, the
claims that have been made for it and the evidence, if any exists, for or against
its therapeutic value. Even the most active of hypnotics are worse than useless
if they are inferior to other readily available hypnotics, or if they have
undesired side-actions that outweigh any advantages that they might otherwise
have.</p>

<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry investigated the literature relating
to Neurosine and published its report in The Journal, Jan. 9, 1915, p.&nbsp;165.
According to this report the manufacturers of Neurosine claimed that each
fluidounce contained:</p>

<p>This chemical blunderbuss was recommended for use in insomnia, hysteria,
neurasthenia, migraine, neuralgia, delirium tremens, epilepsy and many other
conditions. Also it was called an ideal calmative for children suffering from
chorea, the exploiters claiming that “All authorities recommend the bromids,
hyoscyamus and cannabis indica in this disease.” Oliver T. Osborne, professor
of therapeutics in Yale Medical School, does not mention one of these three
drugs in his discussion of the Medicinal Treatment of Chorea, in the Handbook
of Therapy, though he quotes several authorities in this article. Indeed,
he does not mention one of the ten drugs included in the above formula of
Neurosine in connection with the treatment of this disease. It is a curious
fact that Osborne gives the greatest prominence to the use of that drug which
is claimed to be wanting in the formula of Neurosine, namely, hydrated chloral.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may have seen temporary relief follow the administration
of Neurosine in chorea, and may argue that theorizing is of little value in
the face of personal experience. We shall not deny that some may have had
that experience, for Osborne calls attention to the fact that the success of any
medicinal treatment must be judged in the light of the fact that chorea is
self-limited, and the intensity of the symptoms will abate in from two to four
weeks. In view of this, we would hardly dispute the claim that one may
<span class="pagenum" title="407"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a></span>administer narcotics, such as those contained in Neurosine, and the symptoms
of chorea may abate in spite of such mistreatment. In all the years that
Neurosine has been exploited to physicians with such remarkable claims, we
have never seen a report of a careful clinical study in which the product has
been used under the conditions which scientific investigation demands. Would
you prescribe any nonproprietary preparations which had never been studied
clinically, if a horse-shoer or grocer’s boy told you it would cure epilepsy or
malaria?</p>

<p>According to an editorial note appended to the report of the Council on
Neurosine, the Dios Chemical Company consisted at that time (1915) of J.&nbsp;H.
Chambers, his wife and two sons. It appeared that Chambers never claimed
to have any special knowledge of chemistry, pharmacy or medicine, yet we
find that he arrogated to himself or to his employees the right to offer therapeutic
advice to the medical profession, and even to direct them as to how they
should prescribe a given mixture.</p>

<p>We sometimes fail to see the forest because of the trees. It may help us
to obtain a better perspective, in a problem that concerns us intimately, by
resorting to a hypothetic case, if a close analogy is maintained. In order
that we may see ourselves as others see us in such a situation, let us consider
the following imaginary case: You become involved in a lawsuit in which
an effort is made to deprive you of your property and your liberty. You seek
what you had reason to believe was competent legal advice; but, nevertheless,
you lose your case and find yourself deprived of your property and your
liberty. Now let us suppose further that you discover, when too late to permit
you to correct your mistake, that your legal adviser (we can hardly call such
a man a lawyer) had been acting all along under the guidance of a plumber
who made no pretense of knowing anything about law. How would you feel
regarding that pretended lawyer? Would you feel that you had been treated
fairly? Would you feel disposed to speak with all charity of him, to recommend
him to those in need of legal advice?</p>

<p>You would probably feel toward such a lawyer as patients must feel toward
physicians who prescribe proprietary nostrums based on information and
advice offered by those who, though without any special knowledge of chemistry,
pharmacy or medicine, will be benefited financially if their information
and advice are accepted and acted on.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April

<h3>ANASARCIN ADVERTISING<a name="FNanchor_L_257" id="FNanchor_L_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_257" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></h3>


<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;As an old Fellow of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. I beg to present the
following facts to you, and to ask if anything can be done by you to expose
the methods of these people: A concern calling itself “The Anasarcin Chem. Co.”
of Winchester, Tenn., has caused to be sent to physicians a chart on the subject
of “Diagnostics of Renal Diseases.” This chart contains eighteen plates, which
were all taken without knowledge or permission of either myself or my publishers,
William Wood &amp; Co., from the third edition of my book on “Urinary
Analysis and Diagnosis.” The plates are partly composite plates, but mostly
portions of plates, exactly reproduced from my book. I at once caused my
publishers to write to the Anasarcin Company; and a few days ago I received
a letter from a Dr. H. Elliott Bates of 118 East Twenty-Eighth Street, New
York, whose letterhead says, “Medical Advertising.” In this letter the writer
says that it was he who suggested the sending of such a chart, and admits
that all the plates were taken from my book. In this letter he offers to have
a letter sent to every physician of the country “in which it is explicitly stated
<span class="pagenum" title="408"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a></span>that the cuts on the chart were taken from your book, and that complete
information regarding the matters treated on the chart can be found in your
book.” In other words he offers to advertise my book free of cost to me, so
that I should take no further steps in the matter. I consider this entire matter
an outrage, and thought it best to write to you for advice, since my publishers
seem to think that in spite of the violation of the copyright nothing can be done.</p>

<p>Besides the cuts, some of the text on the chart is bodily taken from my
book, while some of the other text, not taken from my book, but apparently
compiled from different articles, is in part entirely wrong, so much so that
I must be ashamed of its being associated with any of my own work.</p>

<p>By giving this letter your early consideration, and advising me what you
think it best for me to do, you would greatly oblige</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Louis Heitzman</span>, M.D., New York.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Comment.</span>&mdash;Readers of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> are, of course, familiar with the
<span class="nowrap">articles<a name="FNanchor_246_258" id="FNanchor_246_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_258" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> that have been published on “Anasarcin,” the “dropsy cure”! Knowing
the standard of ethics that the Anasarcin concern adopts in the exploitation
of its ridiculous squill mixture, our readers will not be surprised at the
standard of commercial ethics which would justify the appropriation of copyrighted
scientific material for nostrum advertising purposes. The statement
of Dr. Heitzmann’s publishers that “in spite of a violation of copyright nothing
can be done” is, of course, incorrect. Something <i>can</i> be done by those who
hold the copyright.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 18, 1919.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>ANTIMERISTEM-SCHMIDT</h3>


<p>Some, possibly many, of our readers have received a letter from Cologne,
Germany, from the “Bakteriologisch-Chemisches Laboratorium Wolfgang
Schmidt.” The letter contains a circular directing the attention of American
physicians to “Antimeristem-Schmidt.” It also contains some advertising
leaflets. One physician in sending this material to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A copy of the enclosed circulars has been sent to many of the physicians in this city, and
probably elsewhere. Perhaps it has already been called to your attention. Let us be as liberal
as possible with our recent enemies. The sooner the old channels of scientific communication
are re-opened, the better. But let us not allow such blatant commercialism from a
foreign country to go unprotested, any more than we should if it were from our own.”</p></div>

<p>It should be noted in passing that the envelop in which the Wolfgang
Schmidt letter came has on its face a rubber-stamped impress to the effect:
“Concerns Cancer Treatment.” The circular letter declares that by means of
Antimeristem-Schmidt “either a cure or improvement has been effected in
numerous inoperable cases” of malignant tumors. American physicians are
asked “to employ the preparation when occasion arises” and are assured that
“every medical man in city or country will be able to carry out treatment
without preliminary knowledge.” With the letter are two leaflets discussing
the use and administration of the product; one contained what was called a
“Synopsis of some of the more recent publications regarding the employment
of Antimeristem-Schmidt in inoperable malignant tumors.” The “recent” publications
comprised three articles published in 1910 and one published in 1912!</p>

<p>Antimeristem-Schmidt was rather widely exploited some six or seven years
ago. As was explained in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, March 8, 1913, p. 766, it is a preparation
claimed to be useful in the treatment of inoperable cancer and as a supplementary
treatment after operations for cancer. The treatment is founded on
a theory advanced by one O. Schmidt that the cause of cancer is found in a
<span class="pagenum" title="409"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a></span>fungus, <i>Mucor racemosus</i>, which, Schmidt at first asserted, carried a protozoon
which he regarded as the real cause of the disease. The vaccine is said to be
prepared from cultures from this fungus. While Schmidt claims that he has
been able to produce cancer by means of the organism, scientific research has
not verified his claims. Extensive clinical trials have shown the treatment to
be without effect. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> also advised its readers on April 19, 1913, that
no license for the sale of Antimeristem-Schmidt had been granted by the
Treasury Department and, therefore, its importation into this country was
prohibited. Neither the therapeutic nor the legal status of the product has
been changed since then.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.M.A., Dec. 6, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>ANTIPHLOGISTINE</h3>


<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Last September, my chief, Dr. J.&nbsp;S. Millard, received a
letter from the Denver Chemical Mfg. Co., manufacturers of “Antiphlogistine.”
This letter purported to quote many large commercial concerns as testifying
to the value of Antiphlogistine. Recently, I doubted the veracity of these
claims and wrote to some of those quoted. I quote from the original letter
of the Antiphlogistine company:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The surgeon to the electric light and electric railroad company in New Orleans says that
Antiphlogistine is the finest thing he has ever used in burns, especially flash and brush burns.</p>

<p>“The physician to the New York Edison Co. makes a similar statement. He says that
the application gives speedy relief and the burns heal quickly without scars.”</p></div>

<p>I wrote to Dr. John Woodman, the physician to the New York Edison Co.,
who replied in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Denver Chemical Manufacturing Company have no authority to quote me<span class="ell">...</span>.
I gave Antiphlogistine a thorough trial, and found it had a very limited use, and I cannot
recommend it for burns<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Again, the Antiphlogistine letter said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be of interest to you to know that at the emergency hospital of the Ford Automobile
Co. in Detroit, Antiphlogistine is carried in stock and is used extensively by the three
physicians in burns, bruises, infected wounds, sprains and other traumatic conditions which
are constantly arising in such a plant<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>I wrote to Dr. Mead who replied as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In answer to your letter of January 25th, will state that no Antiphlogistine has been purchased
or used in this hospital for years past, and I cannot imagine why the representative of
the Denver Chemical Company should make such a statement as attributed to him<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>He adds that “Antiphlogistine has never been used” in his department “on
an open wound, abrasion or burn.” Is there not some way that such exploitation
of our large companies can be prevented?</p>

<h3>“AUTO-HEMIC SERUM”</h3>

<h4>A Cure for Laziness, Ugliness, Frigidity and Many Other Things</h4>


<p>The following letters are typical of many that have been received asking
for information regarding Dr. L.&nbsp;D. Rogers and his “Auto-Hemic Serum.”
This from a physician in New York state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Can you give me any information in reference to Dr. Rogers of Chicago, Ill., who has
an Auto-Hemic Institute?”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="410"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a></span></p>
<p>And this from Kansas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Just received a letter from a Dr. L.&nbsp;D. Rogers, 2812 North Clark St., who is anxious
to sell me a course in ‘Auto-Hemic Therapy.’ Would you kindly inform me what he has to
sell? He did not tell me what it consisted of; am inclined to believe it is a rank fake.
Kindly let me know what <i>The Journal</i> thinks about it. Just what is it? In the letter they
claim that it is practically a panacea for every blood disease.”</p></div>

<p>This from Maine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What is Auto-Hemic Therapy? I have a handsome red and yellow circular from the
Ideal Life Extension Press, 2812 North Clark St., Chicago, soliciting subscriptions to their
publication, offering as a bonus this book, ‘Auto-Hemic Therapy’ by L.&nbsp;D. Rogers, A.M.,
M.D., LL.D., Chicago, and membership in the American Medical Union.”</p></div>


<h5>THE NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY</h5>

<p>In order better to appreciate the probable scientific status of “Auto-Hemic
Serum,” it is well briefly to sketch some of the previous activities of its
discoverer, Dr. L.&nbsp;D. Rogers. For many years Rogers was the head and chief
owner of the National Medical University of Chicago, a low-grade school of
the “sun-down” variety. The “university” is now out of existence and for
some time before it went out of existence was not recognized either by the
board of health of the state in which it operated or by the boards of the
majority of the other states in the Union. The report of the Carnegie Foundation
on medical education had this to say about the laboratory facilities
of Rogers’ school:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The school occupies a badly lighted building, containing nothing that
can be dignified by the name of equipment. There has been no dissecting
thus far (October to the middle of April, 1909), anatomy being didactically
taught. Persistent inquiry for the ‘dissecting-room’ was, however, finally
rewarded by the sight of a dirty, unused, and almost inaccessible room
containing a putrid corpse, several of the members of which had been
hacked off. There is a large room called the chemical laboratory, its
equipment ‘locked up,’ the tables spotless. ‘About ten’ oil-immersion
microscopes are claimed&mdash;also ‘locked up in the storeroom.’ There is
not even a pretense of anything else. Classes in session were all taking
dictation.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Rogers is, or was, if he is not still, “Permanent Secretary” of the
“National Association of Panpathic Physicians”&mdash;whatever that is. In fact,
one of Dr. Rogers’ specialties seems to be the founding of quasimedical organizations&mdash;organizations,
apparently, which may prove useful in the promulgation
of such projects as he may, at the time, be interested in. A few years ago,
Rogers was exploiting a “cancer serum” and, <i>presto</i>, the “American Cancer
Research Society” came into being, L.&nbsp;D. Rogers, president. Soon thereafter
certain members of the profession were circularized urging them to purchase
shares in the “Cancer Research Laboratory and Hospital,” par value $10.
Apparently, the profession did not invest.</p>

<p>A few years ago, also, L.&nbsp;D. Rogers’ name appeared on the “Faculty” list
of the “American Post-Graduate School,” a concern which granted&mdash;on the
mail-order plan&mdash;a long line of sonorous degrees and an equally complete
line of ornate diplomas.</p>


<h5>THE JAPANESE CONSUMPTION CURE</h5>

<p>Then, in 1915, there appeared in the classified columns of certain newspapers
the following advertisement:</p>

<p class="box">
TUBERCULOSIS&mdash;New Japanese treatment;
to prove merits and give discovery quick
publicity will send 10 days’ treatment free.<br />
DR. ROGERS, 546 Surf St., Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="411"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a></span></p>
<p>So far as we have been able to learn, Rogers, for some unexplained reason,
did not call into existence out of the vastly deep a “Japanese-American Tuberculosis
Research Society.” This consumption cure apparently died of inanition.</p>

<p>Then came the “Auto-Hemic Serum” with its inevitable sequel, the “National
Society of Auto-Hemic Practitioners.” Another adjunct to the serum exploitation
is the <i>North American Journal of Homeopathy</i>, the official organ of the
“Auto-Hemic Practitioners” and of the “American Medical Union” and possibly
of some other “societies”&mdash;but not representative of homeopathy!</p>


<h5>WHAT IS AUTO-HEMIC THERAPY</h5>

<p>What is this new therapy? According to a very lurid poster, it is described
as “The Missing Link in Medicine”&mdash;possibly referring to the ease with which
one may make monkeys of certain physicians. More specifically, although still
vaguely, we learn:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It consists in giving the patient a solution made by attenuating, hemolizing, incubating
and potenizing a few drops of his or her own blood, and administering it according to a
refined technic developed by the author.”</p></div>

<p>Elsewhere it is said to consist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. in taking five drops (or some multiple of five) of blood from a vein and putting
it into nineteen times as much sterilized, distilled water, and incubating it at fever temperature
for twenty-four hours, and then making further dilutions according to the needs of the
case, as can be determined only by a physician skilled in its use.”</p></div>

<p>Neither of these statements, of course, describes the “refined technic” of
those “skilled in its use,” but those who are interested can, by sending Dr. L.&nbsp;D.
Rogers, “One Hundred Dollars cash-in-advance” get a mail-order course
in this new marvel.</p>

<p>But if it is rather expensive to learn just how to use “Auto-Hemic Serum,”
it does not cost so much to learn what the “serum” will do. Rogers has
written a book on the subject, “Auto-Hemic Therapy,” which is used as a
premium for subscriptions to the <i>North American Journal of Homeopathy</i>,
price $5.00 per year, payable in advance. In the book Dr. Rogers modestly
assures his readers that he considers his discovery more important than that
of Alexis Carrel, winner of a Nobel Prize.</p>


<h5>A CURE FOR LAZINESS</h5>

<p>One of the chief virtues claimed for this serum is that of developing in the
patient who takes it an unbounded energy that, apparently, makes him want
to work himself to death. In some sensational articles that have appeared in
Sunday editions of newspapers on Rogers’ serum, the stuff has been described
as “Lazy Serum.” One of the first cases described in the Rogers book is that
of a young waiter, “a good-for-nothing lazy fellow who would not work and
would not pay for medical services” and who was turned over to Dr. Rogers’
free clinic. He was given the serum on Thursday and was told to report
Saturday. He did not return until Monday, his excuse being that “he worked
all day Saturday until midnight and all day Sunday and felt as if he could work
all day and all night without rest.” The “case report” ends:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. finally remarking, ‘I feel like a bird’ he flew out of the classroom and we never
saw him again.”</p></div>


<h5>HOUSEWIVES TAKE NOTICE</h5>

<p>The next case described is that of a servant girl who had not worked
for a year; within a week after taking the “Auto-Hemic Serum,” “she voluntarily
beat carpets till she blistered her hands.” Then there was the rooming
house keeper who had spent more than half of each day in bed. After an
<span class="pagenum" title="412"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a></span>“Auto-Hemic” injection she “discharged her maid and janitor <span class="ell">..</span>. and
did all the work of her twelve room house herself, beating rugs, firing furnace
and carrying out ashes besides doing some of the laundry.” “Case No. 7176”
is interesting: A man, generally considered the laziest person in his community
and with a habit of “drinking thirty whiskies a day,” took “Auto-Hemic
Serum.” He stopped drinking, shaved himself and changed from “a
“bum” to that of a sober, clean, wholesome, bright and honest workman.” Then
there was the case of the “lady physician” who “took the serum one evening
and the next morning reported that she had the ‘giggles’ all day”; also she
became “more magnetic.” More remarkable still was the case of the young
woman clerk in a retail store who, after taking the serum, “astonished her
employer by volunteering to work overtime.” In the chapter dealing with
“Ills Peculiar to Women” Dr. Rogers details the moving story of a <i>man</i> to
whom the “serum” was given and who reported that “about the third twenty-four
hours after taking it his bowels moved forty times”&mdash;nevertheless, “he
felt no exhaustion.”</p>

<p>In all phases of human activity the serum seems to work wonders. “The
cases are numerous in which the frigidity of both sexes have [<i>sic</i>] melted after
Auto-Hemic treatment.” A young married woman with a morbid dislike for
her husband took the serum and within a week “became normal.” The discoverer
suggests that in some cases there is no doubt that this serum “would
prevent divorce.” A 40 year old woman who could not endure to wear any
waists but white or black was able, it seems, after taking the serum to tolerate
a veritable Jacob’s coat.</p>

<p>Is, then, “Auto-Hemic Serum” good for everything? Let Dr. Rogers
answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Briefly stated, without any great exaggeration, this new modified serum treatment is good
for anything that is the matter with you, provided the cause is not organic, mechanical or
bacterial.”</p></div>

<p>One infers that in the inorganic, mental, spiritual and nonbacterial spheres
the stuff is supreme. But it has its limitations. For instance, Dr. Rogers
states that he once had “a very troublesome cough which lasted several weeks,
but did not yield to this serum.” Reaching the conclusion that some other
treatment was necessary “he had the bones of his neck ‘adjusted’ and got
immediate relief.”</p>


<h5>AS A COMPLEXION BEAUTIFIER</h5>

<p>The serum “cannot be made up by the barrel and sold at wholesale or
retail”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If it could be bottled and stored and sold at retail like a patent medicine, the demand
for it as a complexion beautifier alone would net the proprietor millions. More than one
person a few days after taking the treatment has been wrongly accused of painting.”</p></div>

<p>Should any of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> readers decide to take the $100 mail-order
course in “Auto-Hemic Therapy” he should realize that even after he has
done so there are certain restrictions in the practice of this “therapy.” In no
case must he administer “a course of Auto-Hemic Treatment” for “less than
$100, paid in advance.” The only exceptions to this rule are “cases of absolute
charity, expectant mothers and to persons positively unable to pay that amount.”
Furthermore, Dr. Rogers says that for the reputation of his method, as well as
for the good of all concerned, “I insist that the entire fee be paid in advance
and that the course extend over a period of one year whether the patient
needs few or many treatments.”</p>


<h5>DOLLARS AND CENTS</h5>

<p>For those who do not wish to take the mail-order course, Rogers offers to
prepare individual specimens of the “serum” from blood that is sent to him
by the physician. The cost of this “serum” is $5.00, “in advance,” of course.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="413"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a></span></p>
<p>Still emphasizing the commercial side, “Auto-Hemic Therapy” is especially
recommended to “the general practitioner growing old and the physician who
is ambitious to build up a creditable and lucrative practice” because “the
health of four people out of five (old or young, whether they consider themselves
sick or well) taken at random can be improved by this method of treatment”!
An Ohio physician was said to have doubled his $3,000 practice in
two years after starting the “Auto-Hemic” method. A Virginia physician is
alleged to have “increased his income $10,000 a year.” A Pennsylvania physician
urged by Rogers to send $150.00 for the mail-order course, was assured
that this “is merely a nominal amount, as most of the doctors have been able
to get this amount back the first month.”</p>

<p>But enough. The story, were it not for the tragic element that forms the
background, would be amusing. But it <i>is</i> tragic!&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.M.A.,

<h3>“AUTOLYSIN” ADVERTISING</h3>


<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Enclosed is a little booklet I received today from the
Goodhue Publishing Co., of New York, exploiting the Horowitz-Beebe cure-all
for cancer, which, were it not for certain obvious serious features, would
make humorous reading.</p>

<p>What psychologic explanation can be made of the fact that there are
always sufficient numbers of suckers to make such pseudoscientific adventures
profitable?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">H. C. Dodge</span>, M.D., steamboat Springs, Colo.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;In my professional life I have been flooded with the usual
number of insults to intelligence both by mail and by the softspoken detail
man. As a result, I have no doubt, of the active propaganda for reform carried
on by <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, these insults have lost a certain quality of “rawness”
and become much more cleverly done.</p>

<p>One of these has just been perpetrated on the profession which will probably
hold the championship pennant for 1916, although I admit that it is early
in the year to begin prophecy. A very modestly bound, well printed volume
comes to my desk with the compliments of the publishers. At the end of the
volume is a group of highly ethical advertisements of other books of the
author. So far, so good. The last four pages, however, contain the advertisement
of a forthcoming book on the “autolysin” treatment of inoperable cancer.
Perhaps we might forgive this were it not for the following paragraph: “This
book tells how the general practitioner <span class="ell">..</span>. may take an active hand in
fighting the malady. The weapons he requires are an ordinary hypodermic
syringe and some ampules of Autolysin. The syringe he already possesses.
Autolysin he may secure, if he is a legally qualified practitioner, by writing,”
etc. Incidentally, the book is advertised to the Intelligent Layman.</p>

<p>Isn’t it beautiful? Too bad the lamented F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;F. with his mock turtles
or those prominent eugenists of scopolamin-morphin fame could not take a lesson
in advertising. It was not very long ago that we were invited to come East
and learn how to use “autolysin,” or else pay the rather heavy fee for an
imported tutor. Now all we need is a “gun” and some of the “dope.” All this
is interesting in view of the recent article on the failure of “autolysin” in
mouse tumor. It is a foregone conclusion that a lot of “autolysin” will be
used, so cancer patients, who have been told that they have cancer, will get
better through suggestion, and a lot of enthusiastic reports will pour in from
medical brethren who have never studied psychology. Then the thing will
slump and we shall all be ready for the next fad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="414"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, each one of these things furnishes us with a text for another
sermon on ethics of medical advertising, so I suppose they do not live in vain.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Comment.</span>&mdash;With each of the foregoing communications is a circular letter
from the Goodhue Company, advertising Dr. Henry Smith Williams’ book on
“The Autolysin Treatment of Cancer.” With this circular is a booklet entitled
“Notes on the Treatment of Inoperable Cancer with the New Remedy <span class="smcap">Autolysin</span>
(Horowitz-Beebe) Issued by the Autolysin Laboratory.” Similar circular letters
and pamphlets have been sent to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> from various parts of the country.
The Goodhue Company, publishers, therefore are apparently killing two
birds with one stone&mdash;advertising the book as well as “Autolysin.”</p>

<h3>“BASIC CANCER RESEARCH” AND “COSMOPOLITAN
CANCER RESEARCH SOCIETY”</h3>


<p>Medical journals, and some other technical publications, have received
recently what purport to be items of news value sent out by the “Medical News
Bureau,” 77 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn, New York. The “manager” of this alleged
bureau is given as D.&nbsp;E. Woolley. These “news items” are undated but are
marked: “(For immediate release)” One of these starts with the statement,
attributed to Mme. Curie, that cancer can be cured by radium and then
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cancer can be cured by the use of selenium and tellurium, more plentiful and less costly
elements,” says F.&nbsp;W. Humphreys of Brooklyn, an American born student of chemistry and
science who has devoted years to the study of the cause of cancer and the discovery of methods
for relief<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of further developing methods of control and treatment of disease by
the use of selenium and tellurium discovered by a number of local scientists, chemists and
physicians, the Basic Cancer Research has been organized and an efficient laboratory established
at 847 Union Street, Brooklyn<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>“Through the education of the people and special instruction to physicians it is hoped
it may soon be possible to gain control of and eradicate the disease which now appears so
great a menace. Mr. F.&nbsp;W. Humphrey, one of the organizers of the new institution, estimates
that within ten years, or perhaps less time, cancer will no longer be considered a fatal disease.”</p></div>

<p>Evidently the joker here is the “Basic Cancer Research” of 847 Union
Street, Brooklyn!</p>

<p>Newspapers are approached from a different angle. They receive free
publicity matter on stationery reading “Cosmopolitan Cancer Research
Society” (D.&nbsp;E. Woolley, secretary), 847 Union St., Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y. With
this matter is a letter from Woolley addressed to the editor of the paper to
which the stuff is sent and asking:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the interest of suffering humanity will you please give space to the enclosed?</p>

<p>“No object of greater importance has ever been presented for your helpful consideration.
Thousands are dying whom you can help save.”</p></div>

<p>According to the “news item” that accompanies this letter the “Cosmopolitan
Cancer Research Society” has been founded for the purpose of “investigating
and developing methods” by which cancer “may be successfully combated
<span class="pagenum" title="415"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a></span>and eventually eradicated.” It states further that the “society” will
“disseminate information concerning symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and
methods of prevention” of cancer. Furthermore, the membership of the society
“includes physicians, scientists and chemists of prominence, laymen of means,
and the sympathetically inclined from all walks of life.” Nor is this all!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Doctor Frederick Klein the eminent authority on urinology and the chemistry of cancer, has
evolved a new colorimetric test which is a most wonderful and valuable discovery in the diagnosis
of cancer and various other diseases. This test will be particularly valuable in all life
extension work because it determines, even in children the possibility of predisposition toward
any particular disease, whether tuberculosis, cancer, diabetes or any of the diseases which in
later life may become fatal. It determines also the vitality of the subject enabling the physician
to accurately determine the condition of any of the vital organs.”</p></div>

<p>We learn in closing that memberships in the “society” are “graduated from
$1.00 upwards according to the ability and disposition of those who may be
interested.”</p>

<p>Located at 77 Seventh Avenue, from which the press agent material of the
“Medical News Bureau” is sent, is the “Basic Chemical Corporation of
America.” According to such information as we have been able to get, the
president of this concern is F.&nbsp;W. Humphreys, the “student of chemistry and
science who has devoted years to the study of the cause of cancer and the
discovery of methods of relief.” We are informed that Mr. Humphreys was
for a while in the employ of a “chemical company” of Philadelphia, and has
been in the photographic line down in Virginia and later was connected with
a real estate concern in Brooklyn. Another officer of the Basic Chemical
Corporation is said to have been in the grocery line in a small village in
Missouri, selling out and later coming to Brooklyn and entering the insurance
business. Still another officer, it seems, was in the fish business. In addition
to these three officers, there are two directors, one of whom is in the fancy
grocery line, and the other is a local practicing physician whose name we find
in the Propaganda department’s testimonial file under Sanmetto and Arsenauro.</p>

<p>The Dr. Frederick Klein, who is described as the “eminent authority on
urinology and the chemistry of cancer,” is not a physician but claims a Ph.D.
from Munich, Bavaria. Klein claims to have developed certain urinary tests.
One of these, according to him, “indicates the body <i>Vitality</i> with great accuracy,”
another proves the presence of cancer, a third is the “syphilis test” and a fourth
is the “pregnancy test.” And these are not all!</p>

<p>Those who read the reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
may remember that Frederick Klein is the gentleman who made “Sulfo-Selene,”
which the Council, in refusing it recognition, described as a “mixture
containing a selenium compound of undetermined composition produced by
reduction of nitro-selenous acid with sulphurous acid, mixed with bile salts
and diluents.” Sulfo-Selene was widely exploited in the newspapers in 1916
as a remedy for cancer, and Klein got a good deal of publicity at that time.</p>

<p>Just what product the Basic Chemical Corporation of America is putting,
or is about to put, on the market we do not know. From the rather vague
talk about selenium and Frederick Klein’s marvelous diagnostic discoveries, it
might be inferred that “Sulfo-Selene” was to be resurrected. Be that as it
may, it seems fairly obvious that the material being sent out by D.&nbsp;E. Woolley&mdash;whether
as “Manager” of the “Medical News Bureau” or as “Secretary” of
the “Cosmopolitan Cancer Research Society”&mdash;is advertising matter in the
guise of news.</p>

<p>In this connection it is worth noting that the American Newspaper Publishers’
Association, in a special bulletin issued in 1909, published a very complete
list of press agents and the interests these agents represented. This list
contains the name D.&nbsp;E. Woolley, who then was sending out press notices for
the National Association of Piano Dealers of America. Is this the gentleman
<span class="pagenum" title="416"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a></span>who is now acting as press agent for the Basic Chemical Corporation of
America? If it is, it may be that the slump in the piano trade has caused
Mr. Woolley to turn from musical instruments to cancer cures.&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 3, 1921.</i>)</p>


<h4>Seleni-Bascca</h4>

<p>In the issue of September 3 <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> called attention to a campaign
of free publicity that was being instituted by a Brooklyn concern that, apparently,
had for sale an alleged remedy for cancer. The press agent material
was of two kinds&mdash;for medical journals and for newspapers. That which went
to the medical journals was sent out on the stationery of the “Medical News
Bureau,” 77 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn. The “manager” of the bureau was given
as D.&nbsp;E. Woolley. The items sent out to medical journals stated that the
“Basic Cancer Research” had been organized to develop a treatment of cancer
by the use of selenium and tellurium.</p>

<p>The material received by newspapers was sent out by the “Cosmopolitan
Cancer Research Society,” 847 Union St., Brooklyn (the same address as the
“Basic Cancer Research”). The “Secretary” of the “Cosmopolitan Cancer
Research” was D.&nbsp;E. Woolley!</p>

<p>The name of one “Dr. Frederick Klein” loomed large in the matter sent
out by the “Cosmopolitan Cancer Research Society.”  Klein, we were told, is
“the eminent authority on urinology and the chemistry of cancer.” <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> called attention to the fact that Frederick Klein’s name was not
unknown in the Propaganda files, as he was the gentleman who manufactured
“Sulfo-Selene,” a product that was widely heralded in the newspapers in 1916
as a remedy for cancer. It was also brought out that Klein, who is not a
physician, claims to have evolved certain remarkable urinary diagnostic tests
whereby the presence of cancer, syphilis, etc., may be determined.</p>

<p>More than a month after the publication of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s article, a letter
was received (October 8) from Frederick Klein. To quote literally from
part of the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the above <i>Journal</i> dated Sept. 3th, Vol. 77, on page 805, regarding the ‘Cosmopolitan
Cancer Research Society’ you have amongst others, mentioned my name Dr. Frederick Klein.</p>

<p>“I wish to inform you that I have given my legal adviser the order to write a note to the
above Cosmopolitan Cancer Research Society, 847 Union St., Brooklyn, forbidden them to
the effect that my name <i>should not</i> be used by above society in any form or writing in any of
their transactions, this has been done some time ago to prevent unethical conceptions concerning
myself.”</p></div>

<p>Shortly after the article of September 3 another item appeared in the newspapers
throughout the country to the effect that the Cancer Research Society
was offering a “$100,000 Cancer Prize” for a “medicinal cure for cancer.” Many
of the newspapers of the country seemed to bite on this piece of free publicity.
This was in the first week of October. In the third week of the same month
a Brooklyn paper announced that 3,000 people had submitted formulas for
curing cancer to the Cosmopolitan Cancer Research Society. The article containing
this announcement gave interesting descriptions of some of the “cures”
submitted and closed with the statement that the Cosmopolitan Cancer Research
Society was establishing “clinics” in various cities. It ended with the statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All treatments are confidential. In this respect the society had the cooperation of the
Brooklyn Bureau of Charities. It also has the cooperation of the American Medical
Association.”</p></div>

<p>The closing sentence is, of course, unequivocally false.</p>

<p>At the time of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s article the name of the particular preparation
which the Basic Chemical Corporation of America was putting out was unknown.
<span class="pagenum" title="417"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a></span>Shortly after the article appeared it was learned that the product was on the
market as “Seleni-Bascca.” A physician, himself a sufferer from carcinoma,
after reading the article of September 3, sent <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> some correspondence
he had received from the Cosmopolitan Cancer Research Society regarding
the alleged cure. One piece was a letter signed “F.&nbsp;W. Humphrey, Acting
Director; Dictated by Dr. George D. Barney,” which read in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our claim is a very simple one indeed, namely that the use of a proper preparation of
Selenium (Seleni-Bascca) restores the Sulphur metabolism to normal; we claim that cancer
cannot exist in any form, when the Sulphur metabolism is normal, the results from the proper
use of Seleni-Bascca in cases of Carcinoma are quick and lasting, the Medical Profession
can hardly realize that in this modest treatment a remedy for the Dreaded Carcinoma has
been discovered.</p>

<p>“Seleni-Bascca in its colloidal form is quickly taken up by the blood stream, reaches the
finest tissues and almost immediately resists the further growth of the disease. The research
work has been going on since 1901, under the direction of Dr. Frederick Klein, in connection
with Medical Men who have proved to their own satisfaction that Seleni-Bascca should be used
as a treatment in every case of malignancy.”</p></div>

<p>Seleni-Bascca comes in small vials containing fifty tablets. Each vial bears
a label reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>SELENIBASCCA.</i> A mixture of Colloidal Selenium in tablet form. Recommended in
the internal treatment of Carcinoma and some other cases of faulty metabolism.”</p></div>

<p>Some of the preparation was turned over to the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory
with the request that the tablets be examined to determine whether or not
they contained, as claimed, selenium in colloidal form. The laboratory report
follows:</p>


<h5>CHEMICAL REPORT</h5>

<p>“An original vial of ‘Seleni-Bascca’ (Basic Chemical Corporation of America)
was examined in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory to determine whether or not
the substance contained colloidal selenium. The bottle contained 50 tablets
weighing approximately 0.1&nbsp;gm. (about 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp;gr.) each. The major portion of
the tablet was soluble in hot water. Qualitative tests indicated the presence
of chlorid, sulphate, small amount of nitrate, potassium, sodium, starch, talc
and selenium. Tellurium was not found to be present. The ash was equivalent
to 5.5 per cent.; over one-half of the ash consisted of a talc-like substance.
The amount of selenium present in the specimen examined was only about 1.3
per cent.</p>

<p>“In the literature sent out by The Basic Chemical Corporation, ‘Dr. Frederick
Klein’ is mentioned as chemist. Several years ago, the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry investigated ‘Sulfo-Selene,’ a cancer remedy, with which the
same ‘Dr. Klein’ was connected. The alleged composition of ‘Sulfo-Selene,’
as given to the Council, was:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots5"><span class="item">“Selenium</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">.25</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots5"><span class="item">“Sulphur (partially in colloidal and partially in crystalloid state)</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">.10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots5"><span class="item">“Potassium carbonate</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">.10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots5"><span class="item">“Nitrogen</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">.05</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots5"><span class="item">“Bile Salts</span></div></td><td class="tal pl05">.50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal pl1hi">“To which is added an inert base or vehicle; as sugar of milk<br />or amylum.”</td><td class="tal"></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“It was claimed that ‘Sulfo-Selene’ was prepared by reducing nitro-selenious
acid with sulphurous acid, neutralizing with potassium bicarbonate and then
adding bile salts. Assuming that the composition claimed for ‘Sulfo-Selene’
was correct the analysis of ‘Seleni-Bascca’ shows that the two products resemble
each other. The tests, however, failed to reveal in ‘Seleni-Bascca’ the presence
of the bile salts claimed to have been present in ‘Sulfo-Selene.’&#8239;”</p>

<p>“The product is not colloidal as claimed as the selenium can be removed
by ordinary filtration.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 19, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>CAMPHO-PHENIQUE</h3>

<h4>Appealing to the New Fledged Graduate.</h4>


<p>The secretary of the Harvard University Medical School received from
the Campho-Phenique Company of St. Louis a letter that, presumably, has
been sent to most of the medical colleges of the country. It read:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="419"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We wish to supply the senior class of all Medical Colleges with physicians’ samples of
<span class="smcap">Campho-Phenique</span> Liquid and <span class="smcap">Campho-Phenique</span> Powder, and Ointment for 1918.</p>

<p>“We will thank you very kindly if you will send us a communication stating the number
of students in your graduating class, and if possible, we would like the name of each and
every student, that we may send him personally a sample of <span class="smcap">Campho-Phenique</span>. In this way,
we are sure the party receives the sample.”</p></div>

<p>Presumably, the Campho-Phenique concern believes in following the old
advice: Catch ’em young! In this connection, it may be well briefly to call
to the attention of fourth-year medical students the results of the investigation
of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of Campho-Phenique. The Council’s
findings on Campho-Phenique Liquid were to the effect that the preparation,
which was exploited under a false “formula,” was, essentially, a solution
of camphor and phenol in liquid petrolatum, substances well known in medicine
and none of which under its own name has been credited with possessing any
superlative virtues. The Council’s verdict on Campho-Phenique Powder was
that “for all practical purposes it is essentially a camphorated talcum powder”
containing, apparently, sufficient camphor and phenol to give the talcum powder
an odor. It was further brought out in the Council’s report that the Campho-Phenique
Company was in effect one of the numerous trade names adopted by
one James F. Ballard of St. Louis. Mr. Ballard seems to market a number
of “patent medicines,” most of them sold direct to the public, but some, as in
the case of Campho-Phenique, exploited to the public via the medical profession.
“Herbine,” a “marvelous preparation” that “puts the liver in healthy condition”;
“Ballard’s Snow Liniment” that when applied to wounds performs “a
perfect cure that leaves no scar”; “Dr. T.&nbsp;L. Stephens’ Chemical Eye Salve”
which “acts quickly in all cases” and cures “failing vision,” are some of the
numerous “patent medicines” made and sold by Ballard. “Collins Ague
Remedy,” “Swaim’s Panacea,” “Swayne’s Panacea” and “Renne’s Pain Killing
Oil” are four more of Mr. Ballard’s products, for each of which he has pleaded
guilty in the federal courts to making false and fraudulent claims knowingly
and wantonly.</p>

<p>If medical colleges of the better class were turning out graduates today
who could be caught by free samples of such nostrums as Campho-Phenique,
then, indeed, would the outlook for the future of scientific medicine be a
gloomy one. But they are not. The young man or woman who goes out today
from a reputable medical college is imbued with the scientific spirit, has
developed habits of straight thinking and will not, we believe, be so uncritical
as to accept at their face value claims made for nostrums of the Campho-Phenique
type.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 9, 1918.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>“CINCHOPHEN”: FORMERLY “ATOPHAN”</h3>


<p>It will be remembered that the Federal Trade Commission adopted the
names arsphenamin and neo­arsphenamin for the drugs first introduced as
“salvarsan” and “neosalvarsan,” respectively; the terms barbital and barbital
sodium for the substances first introduced as “veronal” and “veronal sodium,”
and the word procain as the name for the compound first marketed as “novocain.”
In issuing licenses for the use of the patents on these drugs, the commission
stipulated that the drugs should be sold under the new American
title unless the firm desired to use a new trade designation, in which case
the titles chosen by the commission should be given equal prominence. The
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry has cooperated with the Federal Trade
Commission and has adopted the new names as the descriptive names which
appear in New and Non­official Remedies. The Chemical Foundation, Inc.,
which has purchased some 4,500 German-owned patents, many of them for
<span class="pagenum" title="420"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a></span>synthetic drugs, proposes to continue the wise policy of the Federal Trade
Commission by requiring that those who receive licenses for the use of patents
for synthetic drugs must use a common designation for each drug selected by
the foundation. “Cinchophen” has been selected as the designation for the
substance introduced as “atophan” (also described in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
under “phenyl­cinchoninic acid”). In consideration of this action on the part
of the Chemical Foundation, and also because physicians found it difficult to
use the pharmacopeia name “phenyl­cinchoninic acid,” the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry has recognized the contracted term “cinchophen” as a name
for the drug introduced as “atophan.” It is hoped that physicians will support
this simplified and nonproprietary nomenclature in the same spirit with which
they adopted the terms “arsphenamin,” “barbital” and “procain.”&mdash;(<i>Editorial

<hr class="r16" />
<h3>“COLLOSOLS”: AN UNCRITICAL ENGLISH ENDORSEMENT</h3>


<p>Under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, there has just appeared a report on the present status of colloid
chemistry<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_247_260" id="FNanchor_247_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_260" class="fnanchor">247</a></span> The work has been recognized as sufficiently important to receive
the endorsement of the government Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research. Of particular interest to physicians is the chapter on “Administration
of Colloids in Disease” written by Alfred B. Searle, “consulting
chemist, Sheffield.” After a somewhat academic generalization of colloidal
drugs, the “thesis” is devoted largely to the “Collosols”&mdash;proprietary preparations
made by the Crookes Laboratories. The “scientific” evidence presented
by Searle for colloids in medicine reads as if the advertising literature of
the Crookes concern had been considered ample source of information. Thus:
“Colloidal Manganese,” besides having been “used with remarkable and surprising
results in the treatment of coccogenic skin diseases<span class="ell">,..</span>. gives
excellent results [in impetigo, chronic seborrheic eczema and acute folliculitis]
when employed in conjunction with intramine”! The grave danger of the
intramine therapy has been known for more than two years, both here and
abroad<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_248_261" id="FNanchor_248_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_261" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> in fact, one author stated that in cases of intramine injections, “the
pain is undiluted torture.” In a style as bombastic and verbose as the usual
house-organ write-up, the report recklessly details all sorts of conditions in
which so-called colloids&mdash;and particularly the “Collosol” brand&mdash;have been
recommended, but derogatory findings are conspicuous by their omission.
Even Sir Malcolm Morris is quoted as lending his name (and title) to the
endorsement of “Collosols.”</p>

<p>In the United States the medical profession has created a means whereby
physicians need not be misled by such “high” authorities as evidently has
been the case with our English confrères. Once more the value of the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry is strikingly manifested. What are the facts
about “Collosols”? The Council has reported that a number of the “Collosol”
preparations were not colloids at all, and “if <span class="ell">..</span>. injected intravenously
as directed, death might result, making the physician morally if not legally
liable”<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_249_262" id="FNanchor_249_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_262" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> that in the cases in which the therapeutic claims were examined, the
claims were found to be either exceedingly improbable or exaggerated; furthermore,
<span class="pagenum" title="421"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a></span>that the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory found “Collosol Cocaine,” on
analysis, to contain only 40 per cent. of the claimed amount of cocain<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_250_263" id="FNanchor_250_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_263" class="fnanchor">250</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the findings which have been presented to the American physician.
But the British physician is now being made the object of an intensive advertising
campaign for “Collosols,” based in part on an uncritical, pseudo­governmental
endorsement. Just so long as the English profession will not protect
itself by creating a competent board to examine and judge proprietary medicines
and to control methods of exploitation, just so long will such extravagant
and even cruelly misleading claims continue to impede scientific progress in
therapeutics.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 18, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>COTTON PROCESS ETHER</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Please let me know what information you have about the enclosed
clipping?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">E. W. Carpenter</span>, M.D., Greenville, S. C.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;“Cotton Process Ether,” manufactured by the Du Pont Co., has been
given considerable notoriety in the lay press. A letter of inquiry addressed to the firm elicits
the information that “Cotton Process Ether is a very highly refined Di-ethyl Ether charged
with Ethylene Gas.” <span class="ell">..</span>. What is your opinion of the “Cotton Process Ether”? Has
the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry investigated this product?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">John L. Atlee</span>, M.D., Lancaster, Pa.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I have been waiting for some reference to the new anesthetic referred to
in the enclosed clipping, but if any has been made in the medical press I have failed to notice
it. If there is anything of interest in connection with this item, and it is not too much
trouble, I will thank you to put me in touch with the situation.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Holman Taylor</span>, M.D., Fort Worth, Tex.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;About January 20, the “News Service” of the “E.&nbsp;I. Du Pont De
Nemours and Co., Inc.,” circularized the press of the country with what it was
pleased to term a “good ‘filler’&#8239;”; this particular piece of press agent work
dealt with “The New Du Pont Ether.” To quote one paragraph from the
“News Item”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The new anesthetic, which is a highly refined di-ethyl ether, modified by
the addition of gases, has the following characteristics: (1) the property of
inducing and maintaining anesthesia with practical freedom from postoperative
nausea, and (2) the property of inducing and maintaining analgesia
(conscious insensibility to pain) as distinguished from anesthesia (insensibility
to pain plus narcosis).</p></div>

<p>The Du Pont Ether and the claims made for it are seemingly based on the
work of one man, “James H. Cotton, M.A., M.D., Toronto, Canada,” who published
an article on “Cotton Process Ether and Ether Analgesia,” in the <i>American
Journal of Surgery</i> for April, 1919. However, Cotton did not give the
composition of the “new” ether nor, so far as we are aware, has his work been
<span class="pagenum" title="422"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a></span>corroborated. In view of the inquiries received, the Secretary of the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry asked the Du Pont Chemical Works for the composition
of the new ether. From the firm’s reply we quote one paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The procedures of manufacture, and the exact composition of
our ether, we regard as confidential information which we are entitled to
retain unless a condition were to arise in which we were unable alone to
satisfy the demand for this type of ether.”</p></div>

<p>It has been recognized&mdash;and incorporated in the “Principles of Medical
Ethics”&mdash;that the use of a therapeutic agent of unknown composition is
unscientific and contrary to the best interests of the medical profession and
the public; but it is many times more serious for a physician to employ a
secret or semisecret substance as an anesthetic. A physician using such a
semisecret substance would have little defense if the patient should die.&mdash;(<i>Query
in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 21, 1920.</i>)</p>


<h4>A Note from the Manufacturers</h4>

<p>In the Query and Minor Notes department of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of February
21, some inquiries from physicians relative to “Cotton Process Ether” were
answered. In referring to the composition of this product it was stated that
the secretary of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry had asked the manufacturers,
the Du Pont Chemical Works, for information on this point and
one paragraph from the firm’s reply was quoted. Another paragraph from
the same letter was omitted; and to this omission the manufacturers took
exception, expressing the opinion that by it <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> led its readers to
infer that the concern had “refused to furnish any information whatever”
regarding the composition of the ether. The following paragraph, italicized as
in the original letter, is the one in question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Cotton Process Ether contains no components which do not occur in other anesthesia
ethers.</i> Its peculiar properties result from the thorough methods taken to exclude harmful
impurities, such as aldehydes, peroxides, traces of acids, carbon monoxide, sulphur compounds,
etc., and to include carefully regulated quantities of only such of the usual components as we
have found to give distinctly beneficial properties to the ether. We are willing to state that
in this class we consider properly prepared ethylene of greatest importance, but we have not
announced which of the beneficial components of anesthesia ether we include in our ether,
or the amount of such components.”</p></div>

<p>As the quotation shows, the paragraph is informative in a negative rather
than in a positive way in that it states what Cotton Process Ether <i>is not</i> rather
than what it <i>is</i>. Since that time, however, the manufacturers have notified
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> that they have definitely decided to present Cotton Process Ether
to the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry for consideration and that in
preparing the data required by the Council will define Cotton Process Ether
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An improved anesthesia ether consisting of highly refined diethyl oxid (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O, plus
approximately two volumes of ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> volume of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and 1 per
cent. by weight of ethyl alcohol.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 22, 1920.</i>)</p></div>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>DIONOL</h3>


<p>“Dionol” is advertised to physicians by the Dionol Company of Detroit.
If one takes the word of the manufacturers, the therapeutic possibilities of
Dionol are apparently limited only by the blue sky. Even the company admits
that “the unprecedented range of action” of this marvel “may come as a
surprise.” A glance over the published “case reports” confirms the inference.
From “Bed Sores,” “Bubo,” “Catarrh” and “Circumcision” through “Croup,”
<span class="pagenum" title="423"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a></span>“Deafness,” “Dysmenorrhea” and “Eczema,” including “Endometritis,” “Erysipelas,”
“Gastritis” and “Hemorrhoids,” not omitting “Osteomyelitis,” “Otitis
Media,” “Pneumonia” and “Ptomaine Poisoning,” down through the pathologic
alphabet to “Quinsy,” “Sciatica,” “Spinal Curvature,” “Varicose Veins,” and
“Whooping Cough” one concludes that here at last is a catholicon indeed.</p>

<p>What is Dionol? First it should be said that the preparation comes in
two forms: as an ointment and as an emulsion. The ointment, so declare the
manufacturers, “is <i>always</i> required”; the emulsion may be used “as an auxiliary
treatment.” The Dionol “literature” when stripped of the verbal camouflage
with which it abounds may be said to propound the following theories and
propositions: First, that the nerves of the body are electric conductors insulated
from the surrounding tissues by the nerve sheaths; second, that inflammation
breaks down the insulation with the resultant escape of the current and an
interference with the normal metabolic action of the cells; third, that Dionol,
when applied to the body, penetrates the tissues, “coating the cells and with
them the nerve sheaths with a nonconducting layer which is sufficient to
insulate the nerve sheaths and stop the leak.”</p>

<p>So much for the theory on which the alleged action of Dionol is based.
Dionol itself is a sort of glorified petrolatum. Not, of course, that the manufacturers
describe it in any such crude and understandable language. According
to the company, Dionol is “composed of pure hydrocarbons, especially
selected with regard to specific gravity, viscosity and other necessary physical
properties” which has been “perfectly <i>deionized</i> by our special scientific process
under the Baines Method.” It appears, from further reading, that ordinary
petrolatum will not “turn the trick”; presumably because it does not overcome
the human short circuits which the Dionol Company declare are always present
in inflammation. When, however, the petrolatum has been subjected to the
“Baines Method” it achieves, it seems, an esoteric value that puts to shame its
plebeian origin.</p>

<p>The whole thing is very simple. To those physicians that like this sort of
thing this preparation should make a strong appeal.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 26, 1918.</i>)</p>


<h4>Glorified Petrolatum</h4>

<p>An Indiana physician sends us in a batch of leaflets detailing the marvels
of “Dionol” and thus comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I received the enclosed in the mail today and I am puzzled, perplexed and astounded. I
had formed the opinion that the profession was getting better; that it was more scholarly than
formerly when the two course school was still in existence and any one could matriculate;
that it was no longer possible for a ‘patent medicine’ manufacturer to palm off his wares on
us. After reading this stuff and realizing that such methods must be remunerative, I am
deeply humiliated. Is it possible that educated physicians respond to this kind of advertising?
Or has some one perpetrated a joke on me? If the profession can be thus successfully
exploited one can no longer wonder at the following which every new ‘ic’ and ‘ism’ acquires.”</p></div>

<p>It is a pity that the medical profession generally does not react to the
Dionol and similar advertising as does our correspondent. As the concern
continues to do business, the presumption is that at least some physicians are
using Dionol. As was pointed out in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of Jan. 26, 1918, Dionol
seems to be a glorified and esoteric form of petrolatum. The exploitation of
Dionol is based on the following theory: (1) The brain is a generator of
neuro-electricity; (2) the nerves are the conductors of this electricity; (3) the
nerve sheaths are the insulator; (4) wherever there is local inflammation the
nerves are short circuited, due to a breaking down of the insulation resistance
of the nerve sheath; (5) this results in “an escape of neuro-electricity;” (6)
Dionol coats the nerve sheaths with a nonconducting layer and this restores
the insulation and “stops the leak.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="424"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a></span></p>
<p>Whether this ingenious theory was invented to lend an air of verisimilitude
to an otherwise bald and unconvincing tale and give a “reason for being” for
Dionol or whether Dionol was first invented and it became necessary to evolve
a theory that would give some plausibility to the claims made for this etheralized
petrolatum, we are unable to say. In any case the theory and the product
are exploited together.</p>

<p>Among the material sent in by a correspondent are some “Dionol Case
Reports.” Neither the names nor the addresses of the physicians making these
reports are given, but the company states that they may be had “on request.”
One special “report” is featured under the heading “Infected Wound. Striking
Results After United States and French Government Army Surgeons Failed”
is signed “Dr.&nbsp;W.” It is dated July 19, 1919. A few months ago the Dionol
Company was sending out this same testimonial with the full name and
address of the “doctor” giving it. Investigation showed that the “doctor” in
question was an osteopath whose specialties, according to his advertisement
in his local newspaper, are “Catarrhal Deafness and Hay Fever, Acute and
Chronic Diseases”! In this connection it is worth noting that investigation
of some of the earlier testimonials sent out by the Dionol concern and alleged
to have been given by “doctors” showed that the gentlemen in question were
“drugless healers.”</p>

<p>As a “true indication of the value which the medical profession is placing
on Dionol” the Dionol Company has published the names of some physicians
who, it is alleged, have used the preparation.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
Feb. 7, 1920.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>THE ELI PRODUCTS OF ELI H. DUNN</h3>


<p>Physicians are receiving some miscellaneous advertising matter from a
concern that seems to operate under various names such as “E.&nbsp;H. Dunn &amp; Co.,”
“Eli H. Dunn,” “Eli Laboratory,” etc. The concern is located at 3820 Main
St., Kansas City, Mo. One <span class="smcap">Journal</span> reader, who is evidently not greatly
impressed by this material, forwards the stuff to us with the laconic request:
“Will you please give me your opinion on this junk?”</p>

<p>The “junk” referred to comprised, in part, an advertising leaflet on “Eli
606 Capsules,” another leaflet on “Eli Vaginal Capsules,” still another on “Eli
‘Vim’ Restorative;” then there was reference to the inevitable nostrum for
intravenous use: “Ampoules Eli Venhydrarsen.” A four-page leaflet, headed
in large and very black letters “Confidential Guide to Live Wire Physicians
Only,” expressed its key-note in the opening paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How to make MONEY as well as REPUTATION in the treatment of all CHRONIC
AILMENTS and all types, forms and sequella of VENEREAL diseases.”</p></div>

<p>The “Eli ‘Vim’ Restorative” is said to be a “tonic aphrodisiac.” The
“action” of the product is to “Arouse Sexual Ardor and Desire. Influx blood
supply to the genital organs.” A postscript to the “Guide” urges physicians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you do not already use Intravenous Serums, by all means get an outfit, if for no
other reason than to meet the popular DEMAND.”</p></div>

<p>A “Special Note” in the “Confidential Guide” advises physicians who “have
to deal with Hysteria” to “write the Author of this Guide, who will explain
by personal letter a method of cooperation by which such Convulsions may
be At Once and forever stopped<span class="ell">...</span>. There will be $100 for You from
every case treated.” One physician wrote to the “Author of this Guide”&mdash;Eli
H. Dunn, M.D.&mdash;asking for further information on this treatment for hysteria.
He received in reply two letters both signed Eli H. Dunn; one was to be
<span class="pagenum" title="425"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a></span>shown to the patient, the other was for the doctor’s own information. The
letter for the patient to see described the marvelous effects of “Dunn’s Intravenous
and Restorative Treatment” in hysteria and recommended it “with the
utmost confidence in every case able to pay you the fee commensurate with
the service you render.” Then followed these two paragraphs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cost of the treatment when administered by yourself is $300 CASH WITH ORDERS
which includes one complete outfit and technique for administering.</p>

<p>“Should you call me personally in consultation an additional fee of $150 per diem covering
the time I am away from my Kansas City office; fees to be collected and held until I arrive.”</p></div>

<p>The letter that was intended only for the doctor’s eye declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are to have $100 of the fee and $50 of the per diem.”</p></div>

<p>It explained that the “complete outfit” referred to in the “patient’s letter”
would “consist in part of a tube of intravenous medication” and doses of
“Restorative Capsules” and “Eli 606 Capsules.”</p>

<p>Eli H. Dunn seems to have had a somewhat varied and spectacular career.
After being graduated in 1885 he apparently started practice in Orion, Ill.
During the nineties he was practicing at Elma, Iowa, and about 1900 he seems
to have moved to Kansas City, Mo. During 1906 and 1908, he also had an
additional office at Denver, Col. About this time he was exploiting “Dunn’s
Uterine Evacuant” which was “a strictly legitimate” product which could “be
injected within the uterus with perfect safety and immediate effect.” This
stuff was advertised both from the Kansas City and the Denver offices. The
“Personal Column” of a Kansas City paper in 1910 carried the message to
“Ladies” that “Dr. Dunn” was a “Regular physician for women only,” Dunn’s
violation of the postal laws in 1911 and of the federal Food and Drugs Act
in 1912 need not be gone into at this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> would feel like apologizing for devoting space to such a preposterous
scheme were it not for the fact that physicians, being human, sometimes
“fall for” preposterous schemes. Some, we know, have nibbled at Dunn’s
bait; others may do so. The gross commercialism that permeates the advertising
matter sent out by Dunn again emphasizes the fact that the fad for
intravenous medication offers an attractive field for those who would exploit
our profession.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 22, 1919.</i>)</p>

<p>“Have you any information in regard to this party and his treatment for cancer? This is
the first I have heard of any such work having been done. One wonders if it is presented in
good faith or if the money god has overcome the gentleman’s scientific spirit.”</p>

<p>“Is this just one more of them? Why a roan horse? Some people might want serum
from a nice bay or calico cow pony.”</p></div>

<p>The literature referred to comes in an envelop bearing the name of “T.&nbsp;J.
Glover, Research Laboratory, Toronto, Canada,” but mailed, apparently, from
<span class="pagenum" title="426"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></span>New York City. The enclosures are a single sheet circular signed Thomas
Joseph Glover and entitled “Etiology of Cancer,” a “Directions” slip and a
card quoting prices. In the circular Dr. Glover states that he has prepared
a serum from immunized horses, “between ages of seven and nine years, of
the roan type,” and has injected this intramuscularly “into patients in the
advanced stages of cancer and noticed that it has a specific action on every
known type of cancer.” Further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Up to the present time I have apparently cured cancer of the face, eye, nose, lip, mouth,
tongue, stomach, bowel, bladder, breast and uterus.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to the circular, was a small leaflet giving directions for the
injection of the serum and also a card bearing Dr. Glover’s name and Toronto
address and reading:</p>

<div class="box2">
<p class="taj fs85 lh11em">This is to advise you that <span class="smcap">Dr. T.&nbsp;J. Glover’s</span> Serum for the treatment
of cancer can now be had by application to office at above address.</p>

<p class="tac fs85 lh11em">Send money by Post-Office Money Order or Certified Cheque.</p>

<p class="tac fs75 lh11em mtb1">DIRECTIONS FOR TREATMENT WITH EACH ORDER.</p>
</div>

<p>This advertising material, which is evidently being widely circulated in
the United States, would indicate that the Glover Research Laboratory had
received a permit from the United States Public Health Service licensing the
interstate sale of this serum in the United States. No such license has
been issued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> briefly reported in the department of Medical News, Oct. 30,
1920, that the Academy of Medicine of Toronto had appointed a committee to
investigate the claims made for the Glover “cancer serum.” In the meantime,
the most charitable thing that can be said is that the “treatment” is in the
experimental stage and the reported results have not been corroborated by
independent investigators.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.M.A., Jan. 1, 1921.</i>)</p>


<h4>The Toronto Academy of Medicine Reports Unfavorably on
Glover’s Cancer Serum</h4>

<p>The method of exploitation of the alleged cancer serum being put out by
Dr. T.&nbsp;J. Glover of Toronto, Canada, was briefly discussed in this department
of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> for January 1. At that time it was pointed out that the
medical profession of the United States was being widely circularized by
Dr. Glover and that, while the letters purported to come from Toronto, they
were, in fact, mailed from New York City. Since this article appeared the
circularization seems to have continued undiminished and physicians in various
parts of the United States have sent in the Glover advertising material. Oddly
enough, the matter now sent out, while identical in every respect with that
dealt with in the previous article, bears a different return address on the
back of the envelop. The envelops are the same; but the legend “T.&nbsp;J. Glover
Research Laboratory, 538 Jarvis St., Toronto, Canada,” has been crudely
crossed out and there has been substituted by means of a rubber stamp the
legend “MRS. STEWART, 309 W. 54th St., New York.” Still later letters
have been modified to the extent that the letters “RS” of “MRS.” have been
cut out of the stamp and it now reads “M&#8199;&#8199;.&nbsp;STEWART.”</p>

<p>There has now come to hand a report just published by a special committee
appointed by the council of the Academy of Medicine, Toronto, to investigate
<span class="pagenum" title="427"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a></span>the Glover Serum. The report of this committee may be summed up by one
of its closing paragraphs, which reads:</p>

<p class="ml2em">“The data which your committee has been able to obtain have not
convinced it that the results of treatment obtained by the use of Dr.
Glover’s serum are better than those obtained by similar methods introduced
by others, and which have ultimately disappointed the hopes entertained
of them.”</p>

<p>The committee’s report deals with the claims that Dr. Glover has made
for his serum, both experimental and clinical. It seems that Dr. Glover has
claimed that, experimentally, he had (1) cultured cancer cells and from these
cells had isolated and cultured an organism which he declared was confined
to, and present in, every type of cancer; (2) produced cancer in a number of
animals by inoculation with these cells and organisms; (3) obtained a serum&mdash;from
a horse that had been injected with cultures of these cells and organisms&mdash;which,
when injected into experimental animals rendered them immune
to inoculation, and (4) produced improvement or cure in cases of human cancer
by the injection of his serum. The committee reported that it was unable to
obtain any evidence to substantiate Dr. Glover’s claims on the experimental
aspect of the question as Dr. Glover had refused to permit representatives of
the committee to visit his laboratory; had refused the request of the committee
to be allowed to examine his cultures and experimental material; had
not acceded to the request of the committee that he demonstrate his ability
to culture cancer cells and organisms and to produce cancer by inoculation
or to immunize animals against it.</p>

<p>The committee attempted also to collect information which would enable
it to pass on the clinical claims made by Dr. Glover, first, as to whether he
has succeeded in producing cures, either regularly or occasionally, in cases
definitely established as cancer and, second, to enable the committee to decide
whether his serum in cases definitely established as cancer produces improvement
beyond that which occasionally occurs spontaneously or under palliative
measures. On both of these points, the committee reported that it found no
evidence to warrant the hope that a specific cure for cancer has been discovered
by Dr. Glover or that the serum had produced a cure in any case
definitely established as cancer.</p>

<p>It should be understood, that the committee’s investigations and findings
were completed before the present advertising campaign of the Glover serum
was initiated.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.M.A, Feb. 5, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>GLYCO-THYMOLINE AND POLIOMYELITIS</h3>


<p>One characteristic of the “patent medicine” business is that it trades on
fear. Should an epidemic occur the market is flooded with new nostrums purporting
to cure or prevent the disease in question, while the manufacturers of
older “patent medicines” revamp their advertising so as to make it appear
that their preparations are all that stand between the scourge and the public.
One has but to remember “Peruna’s” exploitation of the yellow fever epidemic
in New Orleans some years ago and the way in which the exploiters of
“Pond’s Extract” played on the fears of the public at the time of the former
meningitis epidemic in New York City.</p>

<p>At present the public is much exercised over the epidemic of infantile
paralysis. Anticipating that the nostrum fraternity would attempt to reap a
golden harvest from the public distress, the federal officials issued a bulletin
of warning on the subject. Naturally, the bulletin was addressed to the lay
public, the government assuming that physicians knew enough to avoid being
<span class="pagenum" title="428"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a></span>misled by any such advertising campaigns. Apparently, the assumption is too
broad. At any rate, the manufacturers of “Glyco-Thymoline” are circularizing
physicians, one of whom writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am enclosing circular letter that I received this morning which seems
to me almost a crime. I do not suppose that there is any way to prevent anything of this
sort, but it is certainly a shame to attempt to deceive people in this way. As I recollect,
Glyco-Thymoline is almost inert, practically no more efficient than Dobell’s Solution.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">E. Fletcher Ingals</span>, M.D., Chicago.</p></div>

<p>The circular letter referred to was on the stationery of Kress &amp; Owen Company,
manufacturers of Glyco-Thymoline. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Doctor</i>:&mdash;Regarding Infantile Paralysis, it is conceded that the source of infection is
through the Nose, Mouth and Throat.</p>

<p>Taking this measure to be correct, we believe that there is no safer prophylactic measure
than the use of Glyco-Thymoline, with three parts of water, as a mouth, tooth and nasal
wash, by means of the K. &amp; O. Nasal Douche and the toothbrush.</p>

<p>Glyco-Thymoline tends to promote exosmosis, and prevents the absorption of the germ or
toxic matter.</p>

<p>We would be glad to send you samples of both Glyco-Thymoline and the Douche should
you so desire.</p>

<p>With best wishes, we beg to remain,</p>

<p class="tac">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Kress &amp; Owen Company.</span></p></div>

<p>Glyco-Thymoline has been discussed in these pages. A report of the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry pointed out that this “patent medicine” is
simply a weak antiseptic, so feeble that even in full strength it does not kill
<i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i> in four hours and is of little, if any, greater therapeutic
value than sterile salt solution. Yet, Glyco-Thymoline has been recommended
by its manufacturers, either directly or inferentially, for such diseases as diphtheria,
ophthalmia neonatorum and consumption. Today its manufacturers put
it forward as one of the safest prophylactic measures against infantile paralysis
and have the effrontery to make this suggestion, not to the uninstructed public
but to the medical profession. Presumably, as a business organization, the
concern believes it will convince a sufficient number of physicians of the
therapeutic efficacy of its product to pay for the cost of this advertising campaign.
If it appraises the situation correctly there need no longer be any
wonder expressed that in the recent suit against <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, “patent medicine”
makers were able to enlist the help of medical men.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 16, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>GLYKERON: COLD STORAGE TESTIMONIALS&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_N_264" id="FNanchor_N_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_264" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></h3>


<p>The law which limits the length of time that food products may be kept
in cold storage could with advantage have its scope extended to include “patent
medicine” testimonials. Physicians recently received through the mails&mdash;at a
time when the mails were frightfully congested with Christmas business&mdash;a
sixteen page pamphlet sent out in a plain envelop as first class matter. The
caption of the pamphlet reads: “Cough and Its Treatment in Pulmonary and
Laryngeal Tuberculosis: By Henry Levien, M.D., While Medical Director
and Physician-in-Charge of the Liberty Sanitarium, Liberty, N.&nbsp;Y. From the
<i>Buffalo Medical Journal</i>.” The pamphlet is devoted to the alleged virtues of that
dangerous and widely advertised nostrum, “Glyco-Heroin (Smith),” whose
more recent and less descriptive name is now “Glykeron.” Physicians might
assume, and doubtless will assume, from the pamphlet that this reprint represents
a recent pronouncement on the subject with which it deals. The facts
<span class="pagenum" title="429"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a></span>are that the “Liberty Sanitarium” has, apparently, been out of existence for at
least fifteen years, while the article itself originally appeared more than eighteen
years ago&mdash;September, 1901. One of many physicians who sent in the copies
received called attention to the fact that he had left the address to which the
pamphlet was directed, more than six years ago. Even at that, the mailing
lists of the concern that sells this heroin-containing nostrum are more than
twelve years ahead of its “clinical reports.”&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 17, 1920.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>GRAY’S GLYCERINE TONIC: “WHOSE BREAD I EAT
HIS SONG I SING”</h3>


<p>Last September the United States Department of Agriculture issued a press
bulletin describing the work of the Bureau of Chemistry in prosecuting the
venders or manufacturers of fraudulently exploited “patent medicines.” At the
end of the bulletin was a tabulated list of “other preparations against which
the government’s charge that they were falsely or fraudulently labeled was
sustained by the federal courts.” Tucked away in the list was a product
often euphemistically described as an “ethical proprietary” but none the less
essentially a “patent medicine”&mdash;“Gray’s Glycerine Tonic.” The editor of the
<i>Atlanta Journal of Medicine</i>, apparently not having read the bulletin with
any great degree of care, published it verbatim. Thus it was that the <i>Atlanta
Journal-Record of Medicine</i> for September, 1915, presented the interesting
sight of a half-page advertisement of “Gray’s Glycerine Tonic” in the same
issue that contained the government’s article classifying “Gray’s Glycerine
Tonic” among the false and fraudulent products! What happened? In the very
next issue the <i>Atlanta Journal-Record of Medicine</i> apologized thus editorially:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In our September issue, Gray’s Glycerine Tonic Comp. was inadvertently included in a
list that seemed to be under the ban of the Government and very likely an injustice has been
done the Purdue Frederick Company which we desire to undo as far as possible.”</p></div>

<p>Did the editor mean by “inadvertently included,” that he would have
omitted “Gray’s Glycerine Tonic” from the government’s list had he noticed
it in time? If so, on what grounds? It is a fact that “Gray’s Glycerine
Tonic” was one of the “Fifty Falsely Labeled Medicines”; it is also a fact
that it is one of the products that government officials and the federal courts
have declared to be sold under claims that are “false, fraudulent and misleading.”
If “Gray’s Glycerine Tonic” was fraudulently exploited&mdash;and the government
and the courts have so declared it&mdash;why is it necessary for the editor of
a medical journal to apologize to his subscribers for having told them so?&mdash;(<i>Editorial
from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 1, 1916.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>HAGEE’S CORDIAL OF COD LIVER OIL</h3>


<p>“Under the deceptive heading ‘Making Cod Liver Oil Palatable,’ the
<i>Charlotte Medical Journal</i> in its December issue prints a boost for ‘Cord. Ext.
Ol. Morrhuae Comp. (Hagee),’ or, as it is generally known to the drug trade,
‘Hagee’s Cordial of Cod Liver Oil.’</p>

<p>“The boost intimates that this is a preparation in which cod liver oil has
in some way been rendered palatable, and then goes on to say that this is a
cod liver oil product which has not suffered the least loss of those essential
elements which make the crude oil such a high-class reconstructive.</p>

<p>“At first sight one might question whether a cod liver oil product which
contains absolutely no cod liver oil had not suffered the loss of essential elements.
But a closer reading discloses a significant qualification, namely, the
<span class="pagenum" title="430"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a></span>
phrase, ‘those elements which make the crude oil such a high-class reconstructive.’</p>

<p>“The boost is misleading from beginning to end. The manufacturers have
not succeeded in this preparation in ‘making cod liver oil palatable,’ nor does
their preparation in any way possess the virtues of cod liver oil. These claims
have again and again been refuted, but they continue to be published&mdash;at a price
but rarely in reputable medical journals.”</p>

<p>The above is quoted from the <i>Weekly Bulletin</i> of the Department of Health
of the City of New York. The Bulletin is issued for the enlightenment of
the public.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 8, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>HYPNO-BROMIC COMPOUND</h3>


<p>A physician in Vermont writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This is simply a word of inquiry&mdash;and of possible warning to other practitioners&mdash;regarding
a preparation known as Hypno-Bromic Compound manufactured by H.&nbsp;K. Wampole
&amp; Co. This compound is dispensed by druggists without prescription and contains in each
ounce:</p></div>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have at the present time three young women who are addicts to this preparation as the
result of thoughtless prescriptions from physicians. This mixture evades the working of the
Harrison Act and may be dispensed freely at the discretion of the druggist and, as a result,
these three cases of mine have been able, by visiting at the various drug stores in town, to keep
an ample supply on hand at all times.”</p></div>

<p>“Hypno-Bromic Compound” is more than an unscientific mixture; it is a
dangerous product and should not be sold indiscriminately over the drug counter.
Before the Harrison Narcotic Law went into effect, “Hypno-Bromic
Compound” contained half a grain of morphin sulphate to the ounce instead
of its present one-fourth grain. Physicians remember that Section 6 of the
Harrison law contains a joker&mdash;put over by the “patent medicine” interests&mdash;that
exempts proprietary remedies containing one-fourth grain of morphin or
less to the ounce from the restrictions of that act. While it is illegal for a
physician to write a prescription which contains morphin, no matter how small
the amount, unless he conforms in all ways to the requirements of the Harrison
Narcotic Law, “patent medicine” concerns can sell indiscriminately nostrums
containing morphin up to this amount and the public can buy them without
let or hindrance. No reputable druggist would sell a layman over 700 grains
of chloral hydrate or 2 grains of morphin or 8 grains of extract of cannabis
indica, without a prescription, yet, the druggist may hand over 8 ounce bottles
of Hypno-Bromic Compound which contain 768 grains of choral hydrate, 2
grains of morphin sulphate, 8 grains of extract of cannabis indica, 8 grains
of hyoscyamus and 384 grains of potassium bromid! Physicians who prescribe
such products as Hypno-Bromic Compound and druggists who indiscriminately
sell such stuff are disgracing two honorable professions.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>INTRAVENOUS COMPOUND (LOFFLER)</h3>

<h4>Its Composition and the Peculiar Methods by Which It Is Exploited</h4>


<p>For some time past inquiries have been received regarding Charles Lyman
Loffler, his Post-graduate Course in Intravenous Therapy and especially relative
to “Intravenous Compound (Loffler).” For instance, a physician writes:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="431"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Can you tell me anything about the Physicians Drug Syndicate<span class="ell">...</span>. They are
pushing the sale of Thymozene and offering One Hundred Dollars’ worth of stock fully paid
and non-assessable, free to those sending in their order, and also a copy of Dr. Loffler’s
Lectures on the Blood.”</p></div>

<p>And from another physician:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What do you know of Charles Loffler, M.D., and his Intravenous Compound? A few
evenings ago a man who appeared to be about 40 years old came to my office and tried to
interest me in the above-mentioned article; he claimed to be Dr. Charles Loffler of Chicago.
With him was a young lady whom he introduced as Miss <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>. Miss <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> said that
she had been with Dr. <span class="nowrap">X&mdash;&mdash;</span> [a physician of high standing in Los Angeles] for two months
and that he was using the Intravenous Compound; also quoted other physicians<span class="ell">...</span>. His
whole layout looks quackish, and were it not for the fact that he showed me a letter that
appeared to be from Dr. <span class="nowrap">X&mdash;&mdash;</span>, I should not have given him a second thought.”</p></div>

<p>And this also:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Charles Loffler, M.D., or his agent was traveling around inducing one M.D. in each town
to take up his methods of blood examination and treatment and with a little advertising of
blood examinations free the doctor selected gets quite a run of patronage.”</p></div>

<p>Another physician writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My attention has been called by another physician to Loffler’s Intra-Venous Compound.
May I trouble you to give me any information that you may have with regard to its composition
and its value as a therapeutic agent?”</p></div>

<p>C. L. Loffler does business from Rooms 1101–1102, Venetian Bldg., Chicago,
the location of the “Intravenous Chemical Co.,” the “Physicians Drug Syndicate”
and the “Ma-Oze Chemical Co.” Of these, more later. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
has in its files a large amount of material regarding Loffler. A brief résumé
of that part of the material dealing with Loffler’s professional activities will
be given for the purpose of allowing physicians to evaluate the scientific status
of Loffler’s “Lectures,” “Post-Graduate Courses,” his therapeutic “discoveries”
and his products.</p>

<p>It seems that Loffler was reared in Yankton, S.&nbsp;D. In 1898–1899, Loffler
was a senior student at John Creighton Medical College, but, for reasons that
need not be gone into here, he was never graduated. He received a diploma
from Barnes Medical College in 1900, and in the same year was licensed to
practice in South Dakota. In 1902 he was at Le Mars, Iowa; in 1904 his name
appears in the medical directory, under Sioux Falls, S.&nbsp;D., as “Specialist in
Chronic Troubles.”</p>

<h5>THE INTRAVENOUS COMPANY IN COLORADO</h5>

<p>Charles L. Loffler’s “specialty” is “Intravenous Medication.” In 1912 and
1913, as the Intravenous Company of Colorado Springs, he was sending out
a booklet entitled “Consumption.” This described the alleged marvelous
results to be obtained in the treatment of tuberculosis by the use of “Intravenous
Compound”; there was also a side line, “The Loffler Internal Bath
Plate.” At that time the administration of “Intravenous Compound” was
recommended intravenously, hypodermically, by rectum, by mouth and even
by insufflation. When the stuff was to be given by rectum, the recommendation
was made: “First wash out the bowels with a preliminary injection of two
or three quarts of warm water, using for this purpose the Loffler Internal Bath.”</p>

<p>In 1913 Loffler sought a larger field for his peculiar talents and left Colorado
Springs. After a short stay in Denver he is next found in Minneapolis,
where he was also “engaged in the practice of intravenous therapy” and, incidentally,
seems to have been an organizer and manager of a common law
concern known as the Automatic Thrasher Co.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="432"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a></span></p>

<h5>THE PHYSICIANS’ DRUG SYNDICATE</h5>

<p>In 1919 we find Loffler in Chicago as president of the “Physicians Drug
Syndicate.” This concern&mdash;another common law organization&mdash;had for its vice
president one A.&nbsp;E. Erling, M.D., and for its secretary and treasurer, Arthur C.
Hanson. Erling was <span class="nowrap">discussed<a name="FNanchor_251_265" id="FNanchor_251_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_265" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> in an article that appeared in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
July 5, 1919, on the egregious “Allied Medical Association of America” of
which organization C.&nbsp;L. Loffler was “President” in 1918.</p>

<p>Hanson, the secretary and treasurer of the Physicians Drug Syndicate, is
said to have hailed originally from Minot, N.&nbsp;D., where he was in the drug
business. His name appears in the Propaganda files as the manager of the
Ma-Oze Chemical Co. of Minneapolis, which, in October, 1919, was advertising
in a daily paper of that city:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Protect yourself against influenza. Don’t let the germs get a foothold in your system.
Kill them with Ma-Oze Antiseptic Powder. Use it as a gargle. It is <span class="ell">..</span>. sure death
to all kinds of disease germs.”</p></div>

<p>In a preliminary statement sent out by Hanson in the early part of 1919 it
seems that the Physicians Drug Syndicate was conceived “primarily to supply
physicians with a product to be used in Leucorrhea and personal cleanliness
of women.” This product, apparently, was the Ma-Oze of influenza fame in
Minneapolis. It was to be put out, however, under the name of “Thymozene,”
which, “packed in 4 ounce unlabeled carton for dispensing,” would “show nearly
100 per cent. profit to the organization over the profit which you make if you
dispense your own drug.”</p>


<h5>THYMOZENE, FREE STOCK&mdash;AND EVERYTHING</h5>

<p>In October, 1919, the Physicians Drug Syndicate was circularizing physicians
in Iowa trying to get them to send in $6 for “1 Dozen Thymozene 4 oz.” For
this $6 the doctors were to get, in addition to the marvelous Thymozene, the
following rights, privileges and emoluments:</p>

<p>1. A free Post-Graduate Course in Intravenous Therapy by Dr. Charles
Loffler.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="433"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a></span></p>
<p>2. A gift of $100 worth of stock in the Physicians Drug Syndicate.</p>

<p>3. A copy of Dr. Loffler’s Lectures on Blood.</p>

<p>4. The privilege of purchasing future supplies of Thymozene “at wholesale
prices less discount of 33<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> per cent.”</p>

<p>The letter making these offers mentioned incidentally:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Besides our product Thymozene we have been forced to add a Uterine Wafer to be used
in connection with hot Thymozene douches in Leucorrhea. These wafers are simply miracle
workers.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to this circular letter there was a membership blank leaflet
detailing the marvels of “Thymozene.” There was another leaflet headed in
very large, black type “Influenza” and recommending “Ma-Oze Antiseptic
Powder” or “Thymozene” for this condition. Still another leaflet accompanying
it lauded “Intravenous Compound (Loffler)” and reprinted laudatory puffs
of this preparation that were credited to H.&nbsp;H. Witherstine, M.D., Rochester,
Minn., Joseph B. Klinehans, M.D., Chicago, and the “Loring Park Sanatorium”
of Minneapolis.</p>

<p>In addition to the Intravenous Compound (Loffler) there is, of course,
certain “apparatus for the giving of the treatment” which the Intravenous
Chemical Co. supplies. The “compound” must be given just so, and the Intravenous
Chemical Co. “reserves the right to refuse to supply any physician with
Intravenous Compound (Loffler) who, either through lack of proper apparatus
or proper care in preparation of solution, or for any reason, uses it in such a
manner that will cast discredit upon it.”</p>

<p>The complete apparatus, including 2 ounces of Intravenous Compound
(Loffler), sells for $24. What is Intravenous Compound? Apparently, nobody
knows except Charles L. Loffler, who asks physicians to inject&mdash;and we regret
to say some are injecting&mdash;this nostrum of unknown composition into the
veins of their patients. To a physician who had raised the point of secrecy
Loffler wrote in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sure that you will agree with me that it is far better to place this treatment in the
hands of competent physicians, such as Dr. Witherstine, and many more whose names I will
gladly send you, and to protect the honest and competent doctor who investigates and takes
up the work, than to publish the formula and give to the unscrupulous a chance to try to
make the product and no doubt to claim to cure disease that is beyond hope. The formula
is not kept secret for profit <span class="ell">..</span>. but is so kept upon the advice of a number of good men
who have the interest of the doctor at heart<span class="ell">...</span>. I am willing and anxious to place the
product and the results in thousands of cases before the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. on the one condition that
the formula shall be kept secret for the benefit of the reputable physician.”</p></div>

<p>In another letter written more recently to a physician who called attention
to the secrecy of the nostrum, Loffler wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Intravenous Compound contains approximately 58 per cent. oxygen, 12 per cent.
chlorine, 16 per cent. potassium, 9 per cent. sodium and 5 per cent. boron. I have no hesitancy
in giving it, and it was due to an incompetent man in this office that this was not given
fully in the booklet. He made the changes without my consent and has caused me to answer
many inquiries by physicians.”</p></div>

<p>A seeming frankness is a trick as old as nostrum exploitation itself. Loffler’s
“formula” is meaningless. A quack who was putting out a mixture of 1 part
baking soda and 2 parts common salt might with equal frankness say that his
marvelous combination contained approximately 35.4 per cent. sodium, 4.8 per
cent. carbon, 19 per cent. oxygen, 40.4 per cent. chlorin, and 0.4 per cent.
hydrogen.</p>

<p>In order that the profession might know more about this product a specimen
was turned over to the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory for analysis. Here is
what the chemists report:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="434"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a></span></p>

<h5>CHEMISTS’ REPORT</h5>

<p>“One original 2 ounce bottle of ‘Intravenous Compound (Loffler) for Intravenous
Use’ was submitted to the Association’s Chemical Laboratory for examination.
According to the label, the product is sold by the ‘Intravenous Chemical
Co., Chicago.’ The bottle contained a white granular substance, which
appeared as if the ingredients had been fused together. The product responded
to tests for sodium, potassium, chlorate, borate and nitrate. As this same set
of chemical radicals was found by Puckner and Hilpert (J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 22,
1908, p.&nbsp;1706) to be present in ‘Oxychlorin’ and ‘Zyme-oid,’ a quantitative comparison
of ‘Intravenous Compound (Loffler)’ was made.</p>

<p>“The analysis indicated that all three products are essentially the same:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>“Assuming that the chlorate in ‘Intravenous Compound (Loffler)’ is present
as potassium chlorate and the nitrate is present as sodium nitrate, the figures
obtained by the analysis correspond to a mixture approximately as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>“From the results of the examination it is concluded that this preparation
is a mixture of alkali chlorate and nitrate and boric acid, probably produced
by fusing together the constituents. It is practically the same mixture as
Oxychlorine and Zyme-oid as analyzed nearly fourteen years ago in the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory.”</p>

<p>Throughout the advertising of “Intravenous Compound (Loffler)” the
physician is reminded of the financial returns that the product offers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. The financial return will prove as interesting to yourself as results are to the
patients.”</p>

<p>“And lastly but not less interesting, the financial returns are commensurate with results.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the instruction given me in the use of your Intravenous Compound and the
opportunity presented adds four to five hundred dollars per month to my bank account.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. will not only give you more positive results than have ever obtained in chronic
and progressive diseases but a very remunerative business.”</p>

<p>“Intravenous Compound (Loffler) is supplied in granular form, 2 ounces to a bottle, at
$2 per bottle. An ounce will average fifteen treatments and treatments are at from $3 to $5
each, according to the ability of the patient to pay.”</p></div>

<p>A physician whose name the Intravenous Chemical Company had given as
a user of Intravenous Compound (Loffler) was written to by another physician
who was interested in the matter and he was asked frankly for his opinion.
He replied in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The treatment makes a profound impression on the recipient and is usually followed by
a marked improvement mentally, and I have not been keen enough to draw the line of just
how far the physical or material improvement went and when the psychical began.</p>

<p>“For the office ‘specialist’ of the advertising type this would be a boon, but I am not
entirely satisfied that its use completely justifies its claims.”</p></div>


<h5>SUMMARY</h5>

<p>Intravenous Compound (Loffler) stands revealed as a nostrum of secret
composition which physicians are asked to inject into the veins of their patients.
It must be purchased in connection with some supplementary material, “a complete
<span class="pagenum" title="435"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a></span>set of apparatus,” sold by the same concern. Its successful administration
is said to depend on following a technic detailed either in a booklet sent
out by Loffler or given by Loffler in a “Post-graduate Course” which costs
physicians $50 unless they have purchased six dollars’ worth of another nostrum,
“Thymozene.”</p>

<p>The intravenous administration of drugs is impressive. To the patient the
technic is mysterious and its psychic effect striking. Its dangers&mdash;infection,
air embolism, intravascular clotting, sudden death&mdash;are matters of record.
Every conservative physician will admit that there is no excuse for the intravenous
administration of even those drugs that are well known and whose
effects have been carefully studied, except when distinct advantages are to
be secured. As <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has stated before, “Little is known of the results
to be expected from intravenous therapy even with simple substances.”</p>

<p>What, then, can be said of the physician who subjects his patients to the
intravenous injection&mdash;“at from $3 to $5 each, according to the ability of the
patient to pay”&mdash;of a preparation of whose composition he is as ignorant as
he must be of its effects? Intravenous Compound (Loffler) has been on the
market ten years; it is unmentioned in the literature of scientific medicine.
The name of its exploiter, while not unknown in the twilight zone of professionalism
as the exploiter of a nostrum, as a “Specialist” in “Chronic
Troubles” and “Intravenous Therapy,” as well as in other capacities even
less savory, is equally unknown to scientific medicine.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 12, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>INTRAVENOUS SPECIALTIES</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;There is a salesman here in Salt Lake City making extravagant claims
about the medicines advertised in the enclosed pamphlet. Would you kindly advise me as to
your opinion of it?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">W. C. Schulte</span>, M.D., Salt Lake City.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am interested in knowing the attitude of the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry regarding the products of the Intravenous Products Company of America, 121
Madison Avenue, New York City. If the Council has already reported, please refer me
to the appropriate number of <i>The Journal</i>. If it has not, please give me any information
available.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">H. B. Gessner</span>, M.D., New Orleans.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The Intravenous Products Company of America has not requested
the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry to examine any of its intravenous
specialties, nor have they been discussed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> or examined in the
American Medical Association Chemical Laboratory. The firm’s list of specialties
bears a striking resemblance to those of other “intravenous specialty” firms.
Endoarsan, like Venarsen of the Intravenous Products Company of Denver, is
stated to contain a cacodylate (dimethylarsenate) along with mercury and iodid.
Venarsen was reported on unfavorably by the Council (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, May 22,
1915, p.&nbsp;1780), the inferior efficacy of sodium cacodylate was discussed (<span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, March 25, 1916, p.&nbsp;978) and the worthlessness of sodium cacodylate
as a spirocheticide confirmed by H.&nbsp;N. Cole (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Dec. 30, 1916, p.
2012), William G. Ward (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 3, 1917, p.&nbsp;390), and R.&nbsp;L. Sutton
(<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 17, 1917, p.&nbsp;566). Endosal, like Venosal of the Intravenous
Products Company of Denver, is said to contain salicylate and a colchicum
preparation (the latter is also said to contain iodids). Venosal was found
unacceptable for New and Non­official Remedies by the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry. Like other “intravenous” firms, this company advertises the
intravenous administration of drugs such as sodium iodid and hexa­methylen­amin.
The objections to and the dangers of indiscriminate administration of drugs
intravenously was recently emphasized in a report of the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry “Some of Loeser’s Intravenous Solutions” (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, April
16, 1921, p.&nbsp;1120).&mdash;(<i>Query from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 10, 1921.</i>)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" title="436"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a></span></p>

<hr class="r16" />

<h3>IODEX</h3>


<p>At fairly frequent intervals physicians receive through the mail free samples
of “Iodex,” a black ointment sent out in small, circular aluminum boxes.
Iodex is sold by Menley and James, Ltd., New York City, under the claim
that it is a preparation of free iodin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_252_266" id="FNanchor_252_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_266" class="fnanchor">252</a></span> minus the objectionable features that go
with free iodin. The preparation was examined in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical
Laboratory in 1915, and found practically devoid of free iodin. The laboratory
also reported that when 1 or 2 grams of Iodex was rubbed on the skin of the
forearm on several subjects and the urine collected and tested for iodin, the
results were negative. This disproved the claim that “thirty minutes after
inunction [with Iodex] iodine can be found in the urine.”</p>

<p>The findings of the laboratory, which were summed up in a report (<span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, June 19, 1915) of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry on Iodex,
were essentially as follows:</p>

<p class="ml2em">1. The composition is incorrectly stated; the actual iodin content is
only about half of that claimed.</p>

<p class="ml2em">2. The action of Iodex is <i>not</i> essentially that of free iodin, although
that is the impression conveyed by the advertising.</p>

<p class="ml2em">3. The assertion that iodin may be found in the urine shortly after
Iodex has been rubbed on the skin has been experimentally disproved.</p>

<p>At the time the laboratory reported its findings, it pointed out the obvious
contradiction in the claim that Iodex is not only an “effective free iodine application
without drawbacks” but also a means of “really efficient external iodine
therapy without stain or irritation.” It is impossible to have free iodin present
in sufficient quantities to be thera­peutically efficient and not get skin stains and
irritation.</p>

<p>In a recent issue of the house organ, <i>Pharmacal Advance</i>, there was a large
display advertisement of Iodex under the heading: “For prophylaxis and to
‘Double Cross’ Disease,” with the claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Free Iodine.”<br />
“Rub Through Skin.”<br />
“Does Not Irritate nor Stain.”</p></div>

<p>On other pages of the same issue these claims appeared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no therapeutic virtue in Iodex which is not inherent&mdash;though often latent&mdash;in
Free Iodine; and there is no virtue in Free Iodine which is not available in Iodex.”</p>

<p>“In Iodex all the beneficent properties of Iodine are emphasized and all its disadvantages
are eliminated&mdash;in a word, Iodex is Pure Free Iodine presented thera­peutically active and
efficient, ready for use in all conditions, with all the well-known powers of Free Iodine, but
without the sequelæ of unpleasant effects, as irritation, corrosion, desquamation, staining, etc.,
which defeat the ends of treatment when ordinary preparations of Iodine are used. The fact
that Free Iodine in the form of Iodex can now be used in rectal and vaginal treatment,
without irritation, speaks volumes for its penetrability and bland action.”</p></div>

<p>These quotations are sufficient to show that the manufacturers of Iodex
still persist in their claim that the product contains free iodin. In view of
this, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory has again examined Iodex, having
recently purchased specimens on the open market. It reports that Iodex gives
no test for free iodin, or at most, but minute traces.</p>

<p>An interesting side-light on the methods of Menley and James is also brought
out in the issue of <i>Pharmacal Advance</i> just quoted. Under a “department”
misnamed “Book Reviews” the following appears:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="437"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Actions of Drugs.</span>&mdash;Torald Sollmann, M.D. Published by W.&nbsp;B. Saunders Co.,
Philadelphia. This is a book of lectures designed for students in pharmacy and deals with
the subject in plain and simple language. The author in his introduction has brought out the
fact that over-counter prescribing is baneful both to the public and to the pharmacist himself.
Among some of the interesting points brought out that <i>Pharmacol Advance</i> has always maintained,
namely, that ‘Potassium iodid is not absorbed efficiently by the skin; hence the ointment
of potassium iodid is unscientific.’</p>

<p>“We would especially call attention to Ungt. Iodi U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., containing Potassium Iodid,
used as a solvent for its iodin content. Accepting Sollmann’s statement, it is to be assumed
that Ungt. Iodi U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. has not 100 per cent. efficiency.”</p></div>

<p>Garbling statements from scientific works for the purpose of puffing proprietaries
is not unusual in nostrum exploitation. The facts are that the statement
in Sollmann’s book, introduced in the Menley and James house organ
under the guise of a book review, appeared in a discussion of iodin compounds.
In this the author points out that to obtain systemic iodid effects, it is irrational
to apply iodin preparations externally. So far as the free iodin content of the
official ointment of iodin is concerned, L.&nbsp;E. Warren (Reports of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory, 1917) has shown that even after more than six months
this ointment still contains about 75 per cent. of the free iodin originally added.
The official ointment (Unguentum Iodi, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.), therefore, so far as its
free iodin content is concerned, is far superior to Iodex, which contains no
iodin in its free state.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 3, 1919.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>THE WILLIAM F. KOCH CANCER REMEDY</h3>


<p>A number of inquiries have been received of which those that follow are
typical. This from a Philadelphia physician:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Would you give me any information you have about one so-called ‘Dr. W.&nbsp;S. Koch,’
Detroit, Michigan? This man is said to claim to have in his possession a cure for cancer,
the nature of which I do not know. I know, however, that he obtained a very large fee not
very long ago in treating a case, but without success&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p></div>

<p>While a Chicago physician writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have at hand a pamphlet from Wm. F. Koch, M.D., Ph.D., of Detroit, Mich., which is
supposed to be a reprint from the <i>Medical Record</i> of Oct. 30, 1920, entitled ‘A New and
Successful Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer.’ Will you kindly advise me what you know
about this man’s work on this subject and how much stock I can put in the claims he makes
in this article?”</p></div>

<p>And this from a physician in Seattle, received a few days ago:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Has your office any knowledge of the cancer cure devised by Dr. William F. Koch, Ph.D.,
M.D., of Detroit? He published an article on it in the <i>Medical Record</i>, Oct. 30, 1920<span class="ell">...</span>.
I enclose copy of letter received by one of our patients from his ‘western representative’ which
reads like pure quackery. I do not find Dr. Koch’s name in either the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. or Polk’s
medical directories.”</p></div>

<p>The letter referred to in the last inquiry as coming from Dr. Koch’s
“western representative” was addressed to a woman who had written to Dr.
Koch with reference to his alleged cancer cure. The letter, dated Jan. 19,
1921, was signed “Chas. L. Tisdale, 1898 Geary Street, San Francisco.” It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Dear Madam</i>:&mdash;Your letter of January 10th written to Dr. Koch of Detroit in reference
to his cancer cure has been sent to me by Dr. Koch. I am the western representative
of Dr. Koch and am giving the treatments with his remedy. I am now treating 14 cases here
with some most wonderful results. The amount of the remedy that Dr. Koch can supply
me with is limited and it is a very expensive substance. None of it can be sent to Seattle or
any other place for I have only enough to treat the cases that are constantly presenting
themselves here. If you could come to San Francisco and have the money to pay a reasonable
fee, say enough to pay for the remedy, I would be very glad to do everything I can for you.</p>

<p>“The results that have already shown in many of these cases warrant me in believing that
almost any case of cancer can be cured if the treatment is persisted in.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="438"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a></span></p>
<p>According to our records, Dr. William F. Koch of Detroit was born in
1885. Some years ago he graduated in chemistry and for some time held the
position of professor of physiology and physiologic chemistry at the Detroit
College of Medicine and Surgery. In 1918, Dr. Koch received his degree in
medicine from this same college. Less than a year after his graduation, Dr.
Koch declared that he had “developed a real specific cure for cancer.” In the
<i>Detroit Medical Journal</i> for July, 1919, there appeared a brief article by
William F. Koch, entitled “A New and Successful Treatment and Diagnosis
of Cancer.” A more extensive article bearing the same title was published
in the <i>New York Medical Journal</i> of Oct. 30, 1920.</p>

<p>As a result of the publicity that was given the Koch treatment, the Wayne
County (Detroit) Medical Society appointed a committee to investigate the
treatment. Its first report appeared in the Bulletin of the society for Dec. 22,
1919. Briefly, this report said that the Board of Health of Detroit had placed
at the disposal of the committee twelve beds in a local hospital with the necessary
special nurses and everything else required free of charge. The committee
sent certain patients to the hospital; and there were also some other
patients recommended by different physicians as proper cases for treatment.
There were nine altogether. After going over the cases carefully, the committee
found some in which the diagnosis was doubtful. There were five
cases, however, of undoubted cancer, a positive diagnosis having been made
from specimens and microscopic examination. The management and treatment
of these patients were turned over to Dr. Koch.</p>

<p>Dr. Koch seems to have raised certain objections and to have made certain
criticisms. He also insisted that he ought to have some representative on the
committee. The committee offered to put on any and all he would name.
He failed to name any. The committee reported further that Dr. Koch was
very negligent in his treatment of the patients and finally, on November 26,
the committee met with Koch and went over all the cases with him. At that
time he gave the patients injections and promised to attend to the treatment
regularly in the future. According to the report, he saw the patients only
once more (three days later) and then did not come near them again. As the
patients became disgusted with the neglect, some of them left and the committee
sent the rest home and closed its connections with the investigation
of the subject.</p>

<p>In the same issue of the Bulletin of the county society in which this committee’s
report was published, the editor of the Bulletin stated that from all
sections of the country inquiries were coming relative to the treatment and
“from long distances patients are coming to Detroit to be ‘cured’ of cancer.”
The editor further stated: “It is reported that Dr. Koch is treating many
patients, promising much and charging well.” To this Dr. Koch retorted that
only about 30 per cent. of his patients had “contributed.” The rest were
treated free.</p>

<p>The Wayne County Medical Society Bulletin for Jan. 5, 1920, was devoted
almost exclusively to another discussion of Dr. Koch’s “cancer cure.” It was
there stated that a second committee had been appointed to gather what information
could be obtained from outside sources relative to cases treated by
Dr. Koch. This committee reported that of fifty-six cases of which it was
able to obtain data, only three of the patients showed clinical improvement;
twenty-one of the patients were dead. Three more patients treated both by
the Koch injections and by operation were reported as clinically improved.
The condition of eighteen of the patients was reported as stationary, or unimproved.
In eleven of the cases, the results were unknown but the surgeons
reported unfavorably.</p>

<p>The committee reported further that Dr. Koch’s records were incomplete
and that he had submitted no proof that his injections have any particular
<span class="pagenum" title="439"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a></span>merit and the committee concluded that the study “is entirely experimental
and improperly supervised.”</p>

<p>Evidently, the most that can be said of Dr. Koch’s alleged “cure” for cancer
is that the claims made for it have not been supported by independent investigators.&mdash;(<i>From
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 12, 1921.</i>)</p>


<h4>Further Comment</h4>

<p>Last week some space was given to the alleged cure for cancer put out by
Dr. William F. Koch of Detroit. Incidentally, it should be mentioned that
Dr. Koch’s article of Oct. 30, 1920, to which reference was made, appeared
not in the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>, as stated, but in the New York <i>Medical
Record</i>.</p>

<p>The following correspondence throws additional light on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;To the number of inquiries which you have received regarding
the alleged cure of cancer by Dr. Koch, permit me to add the following
personal experience. On July 1, 1920, I was asked to examine an ex-patient
of mine whom I had not seen professionally for many years. Her husband
frankly told me that for several months his wife had been treated by Dr.
W.&nbsp;F. Koch for inoperable carcinoma of the pelvic organs, that he wished
Dr. Koch to retain charge of the treatment but hoped I would give my opinion
regarding certain nervous manifestations in the patient which were causing
him (her husband) much concern.</p>

<p>At the same time, he showed me a letter written by Dr. Koch purporting
to explain the symptoms and offering suggestions regarding treatment. I
called on the patient and found her in the last stages of generalized carcinomatosis.
Simple palpation of the abdomen revealed multiple nodules involving
both lower and upper abdominal quadrants. I did not feel justified in making
a pelvic examination but noted a profuse foul-smelling discharge on the vulvar
pad. My prognosis did not meet with the deluded husband’s approval. The
patient died within a week and a necropsy confirmed the clinical picture of
carcinomatosis. Enclosed is Dr. Koch’s letter; the patient’s name should, of
course, be omitted if you see fit to publish this note.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">George de Tarnowsky</span>, M.D., Chicago.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter from Dr. Koch which Dr. de Tarnowsky enclosed with his own,
follows. We have, of course, deleted the name of the patient.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Doctor</i>: Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; has absorbed and is still absorbing some killed tumor tissue.
She has absorbed some three pounds, I judge. The results of the absorption are intoxication
quite general (nervous, muscular, perhaps nephritic). The myocardium at present shows no
signs of poisoning but the skeletal muscles and nerve do. The important toxin liberated by
the killed tissue is methyl cyanimide which combines ammonia (NH<sub>2</sub>){sic} from the amino acids,
and thus becomes methyl guanidine. This latter has produced in my patients an intoxication
varying in similarity to: idiopathic tetany in children, chorea in children, eclampsia in
women, and has even been so severe as tetanus in some of the muscle spasms; a toxic albuminuria
has resulted in some of my cases.</p>

<p>All of my cases have cleaned up so far. Of course, I cannot predict in any individual
case, except that when the absorption has been completed and the toxin all eliminated, everything
should return to normal, unless the toxin has destroyed tissue beyond physiological
repair. My suggestions as to treatment would be elimination, saving the kidneys as much
as possible, by whatever methods you find best and necessary.</p>

<p>At present I am treating symptomatically thus&mdash;atropin as a guanidine antidote, arsenic
as a chorea coupled antidote as a prevention to the production of guanidine from the cyanimide,
the use of dilute hydrochloric acid has proven successful to me. Even a urine boiling
solid&mdash;albumen has cleared up in one case in three days just by taking large quantities of
<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent HCl. I am explaining the factors I have contended with in these cases, but do
not want to influence your plan of treatment when your judgment finds me insufficient.</p>

<p class="tac">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Wm. F. Koch</span>.</p>

<p>I shall have a publication out very soon on the treatment of these tetanics and eclampsia
with HCl.</p></div>

<p>It is worth noting that this letter of Dr. Koch’s was written June 28, just
three days before Dr. de Tarnowsky saw Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and less than a week
before she died of generalized carcinoma.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="440"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a></span></p>
<p>Not the least important element in the story which these two letters tell is
the optimism engendered in the husband of the poor cancer patient by the
widely vaunted treatment of Koch. And herein lies one of the most pernicious
features connected with the exploitation of alleged cures for cancer, tuberculosis,
etc. All such remedies, whether fraudulent both in their inception and
exploitation or those which while equally worthless are at least honestly put
forward and are based on a certain amount of scientific investigation, produce
a profound and marked temporary change in the patient’s condition. It is
this that tends to warp the judgment not only of the unscientific layman, but
also of the physician. The psychic element in cancer has been well described
by Weil:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is, indeed, very remarkable that a patient who has been consigned to
death as a victim of a hopeless malady, should regain his spirits and his
appetite, when he is again confronted with the hope of a cure, and of the
eradication of his disease? It is a phenomenon well known to every student
of the disease that a large proportion of cases responds in just this manner
to any treatment which is offered them. Osler has described a case of cancer
of the stomach in which the mere visit to a consultant of sanguine temperament,
though poor judgment, whose assurance of the patient that there was
no possibility of cancer, resulted in the disappearance of all the symptoms
and a gain of 18 pounds in weight. It is this psychic influence, which has
occasionally deluded the honest student of cancer cure, and which has also
so generously played into the hands of the dishonest.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal

<h3>THE LUCAS LABORATORIES’ PRODUCTS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has received several inquiries about the products put out by
the Lucas Laboratories, Incorporated, of New York City. A typical inquiry is
that received from Dr. F.&nbsp;A. Jewett of Brooklyn, who writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The enclosed circular is sent out to the medical profession by Dr. William Lucas, 287 W.
70th St., New York. What do you know of this man and his methods?”</p></div>

<p>William H. Lucas was graduated by the Medical College of Ohio in 1895 and
was licensed in 1897. He is not a member of his local medical society. The
products put out by the Lucas Laboratories are for intravenous use, and their
method of exploitation indicates that the concern is less interested in the science
of therapeutics than it is in taking commercial advantage of the present fad for
intravenous medication. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has protested editorially against the
unnecessary use of the intravenous administration of drugs, and the abuse of
this method of drug giving prompted the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
recently to emphasize the danger of indiscriminate intravenous medication.</p>

<p>The products of the Lucas Laboratories, Inc., have not been examined either
by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory or by the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry. The composition of these products is essentially secret, which in
itself should be sufficient to deter physicians from using them. Of course, in
accordance with all the tenents of orthodox nostrum exploitation, “formulas”
are furnished. Even the crude hieroglyphics that used to be palmed off on
the medical profession by nostrum exploiters under the guise of “graphic
formulas” are outdone by the Lucas Laboratories in publishing the alleged
formulas of its preparations. If we, as physicians, knew more chemistry, the
Lucas Laboratories would not find it profitable to publish such ineffable nonsense
as that which characterizes their “literature.” For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“&#8239;‘Luvein’ Arsans (Plain)” is said to be: “Di hypo sodio calcio phosphite
hydroxy arseno mercuric iodid.” The first part of this “formula” might stand
for sodium and calcium hypo­phosphite. The remainder is meaningless except
<span class="pagenum" title="441"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a></span>that it suggests (but does not insure) the presence of arsenic and mercury
iodide.</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Luvein’ Arsans, Nos. 1, 2 and 3.”&mdash;“Meta hydroxy iodide sodio arsano
mercuric dimethyl benzo sodio arsenate, ai oxy sodio tartaria sulpho disheuyl
hydrazin.” Who can venture even a conjecture as to the possible significance
of this?</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Luvein’ Creosophite.”&mdash;“Ammonio hydroxy calcio sodio hypo-phosphite
arsenous pentoxy iodide.” While the name suggests creosote, the “formula”
gives no hint of this. It might refer to hypo­phosphites of ammonium, calcium
and sodium with iodide of arsenic. Whether arsenous (trivalent arsenic) or
arsenic (pentavalent arsenic) iodide or both are intended, is a question.</p>

<p>“&#8239;‘Luvein’ Hexacol.”&mdash;“Hexa methylenepyro catechin mono methyl amino
ether glycerite.” By moving these syllables around like the old “fifteen
puzzle” they can be arranged to represent hexa­methylen­amin and monomethyl-ether
of pyrocatechin, or guaiacol, having the “glycerite” left over.</p></div>

<p>It is futile to discuss the therapeutic claims made for the various preparations
put out by the Lucas Laboratories. One might as profitably discuss the
therapeutic claims made for “Peruna” or “Paine’s Celery Compound” for the
exploitation of the latter products is on just as high a scientific plane as the
exploitation of the “Luvein” nostrums. The proposition offered to physicians
by the Lucas Laboratories, Inc., is an insult to the intelligence of the medical
profession. Not that the products themselves are necessarily any worse or
any better than many offered for intravenous use; the selling methods are
more crude, that is all.</p>

<p>The facts are, we have entered a new cycle of nostrum development. The
unscientific mixtures for oral administration that characterized so large and
disreputable a part of the proprietary medicine business of the past two or
three decades are giving way to equally unscientific mixtures for intravenous
use. The dangers of the older nostrums are accentuated in the newer by the
added element of risk that is inseparable from intravenous therapy. Add to
this the temptation to the physician in the way of more substantial fees which,
legitimately enough, may be charged when intravenous administration is called
for, and the menace of the new style nostrum becomes evident. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
can only reiterate the warning that intravenous therapy should be employed
only when most positively indicated. Further, because of the danger that is
inseparable from this method of drug administration, physicians should be
doubly careful to see that products employed for intravenous use come from
firms of unquestioned scientific standing.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept.
20, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>“PHYLACOGENS”&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_O_267" id="FNanchor_O_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_267" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></h3>


<p>A physician in Florida writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am enclosing a copy of a circular letter just received from Parke,
Davis &amp; Company, and will call your attention to a marked paragraph in
this letter on which I would like to have an expression of your opinion.”</p></div>

<p>The circular letter which the doctor forwards is devoted to singing the
praises of “Pneumonia Phylacogen.” It opens with the statement: “Influenza,
we learn, has appeared in your section.” The paragraph marked by our correspondent
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pneumonia Phylacogen has been found to be a dependable means of preventing and treating
pneumonic complications of Influenza. In one large city it became a routine measure to
give all persons affected with Influenza an injection of Pneumonia Phylacogen as a prophylactic
<span class="pagenum" title="442"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a></span>of pneumonia. The results were remarkable. Not only did the cases improve rapidly,
but in a great majority of them the pneumonia did not occur.”</p></div>

<p>The “Phylacogens” were repeatedly discussed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> during 1913
and 1914 when these products were being pushed with much vigor by the
manufacturers. We know of no evidence that calls for a revision of the statements
then made regarding them. The injection of phylacogens is simply the
administration of a mixture of the filtered products of several bacterial species.
The results which follow represent the reaction of the bacterial protein&mdash;a reaction
for good or evil. There is no scientific evidence to show that they possess
any specific prophylactic virtue. To recommend their use in cases of influenza, as
a prophylactic against pneumonia, is unwarranted, and the physician who acts
on the advice of the manufacturer must assume the responsibility for the
results. In case of mishap he cannot fall back on the manufacturer; he will
find no scientific evidence to support him.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>PINEOLEUM ADVERTISING METHODS</h3>

<h4>Capitalizing the Name and Position of the President of the
American Medical Association</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Enclosed is a postal card which a physician in Oklahoma
has sent me together with thirty-six cents in stamps. The envelop was
addressed to me at the address of the Pineoleum Company. The postoffice corrected
the address and sent it to me. It is evident, therefore, that the physician
in Oklahoma thought I was sending these postals as an employee of the
Pineoleum Company, or, at least, was endorsing their products.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/442.jpg" width="400" height="232" alt="" />
<div>Postal card capitalizing the name and position of the President of the American Medical
Association.</div>
</div>

<p>Kindly do me the favor to publish this letter in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> as a protest
against the dishonesty of this method of advertising. What is quoted from an
article that I wrote appeared originally in the <i>New York State Journal of
Medicine</i> and was abstracted in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association
of August 2, 1919. The obvious inference to be drawn from this postal
is that I referred to the products of the Pineoleum Company in that article.
I did not have the products of the Pineoleum Company in my mind. I never
have used their products and never prescribed them.</p>

<p>This form of advertising is done with intent to deceive and did deceive
the doctor in Oklahoma. It was therefore a successful falsehood, its success
<span class="pagenum" title="443"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a></span>depending on the false use of the name of the President of the American
Medical Association to bolster up the sale of the product.</p>

<p>I resent the use of my name in connection with the quack advertising of
nostrum venders. The low, vulpine cunning of the method used is on the same
level as the deceit and dishonesty which use this form of advertising to the
injury of my name and reputation. As President of the American Medical
Association I must insist that you protect me by publishing this letter in <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, giving it as widespread publicity as possible.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Alexander Lambert.</span></p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Comment.</span>&mdash;“Pineoleum” is a “patent medicine” advertised in the cheapest
and most effective way&mdash;by the aid of the easy going and complacent physician.
In 1906 Pineoleum was being marketed by the Winslow Laboratory of New
York City, which also put out three or four other nostrums&mdash;“Morumalt,”
“Egeriol,” “Digestylin,” and “Ford’s Nucleo-Peptone.” Pineoleum was advertised
to the public then as it is advertised now, via the medical profession.
Physicians are circularized and are offered a petty graft in the form of a
cheap nebulizer and a sample bottle of Pineoleum. Some time ago the company
seems to have developed a scheme whereby physicians could make money
“dispensing Pineoleum nebulizer outfits at more than 140 per cent. profit.” The
Pineoleum concern for years has also polluted the stream at its source by
attempting to get the secretary of the senior class of every medical school to
distribute its free nebulizer outfits to members of the class and receive therefor
5 cents for each outfit distributed! The life history of Pineoleum is that
of the typical nostrum. Epidemics, of course, are utilized as opportunities for
pushing the product. In 1911 a card was sent out featuring “A Special
LaGrippe Offer”; in 1916 the profession was circularized recommending Pineoleum
as “The Ideal Prophylactic” in infantile paralysis; during the past year
influenza has again been the selling point.</p>

<p>The case described by Dr. Lambert is not the first example of the misuse
of names and statements of physicians. Last December the Pineoleum concern
was sending out an advertising card in which Dr. McCoy of the United States
Public Health Service was quoted as recommending Pineoleum as the “bulwark
of prevention” and “battery of relief” in influenza. Of course, Dr. McCoy
never said anything of the sort. A protest against this particular falsehood
resulted in another card being sent out several months later by the Pineoleum
people purporting to explain and apologize for the misquotations and putting
the blame on the printer. The “apology” ended with a postscript (in larger
and bolder face type than the body of the card) that urged physicians to “secure
our liberal introductory advertising proposition on improved oil nebulizer outfits.”
From the standpoint of publicity for Pineoleum, the “explanation and
apology” was doubtless as good an advertisement as the original card of misrepresentation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>“PROTEAL THERAPY” AND HENRY SMITH WILLIAMS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;What information can you give me regarding Henry Smith Williams,
M.D., LL.D., 104 East Fortieth Street, New York, and the therapeutic value of the “Proteal
Therapy” that he has originated?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">M. D. Baker</span>, M.D., San Jose, Calif.</p>
</div>

<p>The above letters are selected from many received on the subject. Henry
Smith Williams is better known in the journalistic world than in the field of
scientific medicine. He was graduated by the Chicago Medical College in 1884.
In the thirteen issues of medical directories of the United States that have
been published during the past thirty years Dr. Williams’ name does not appear&mdash;except
for the issues of 1890 and 1893&mdash;until the 1914 edition. So far as we
have been able to find, Dr. Williams had not until 1915 contributed any articles
to medical journals. The catalog of the Surgeon General’s Library contains
no reference to any articles of Dr. Williams except those that have appeared
in popular magazines. The volumes of the Index Medicus from 1907 until
1914, inclusive, also contain no references to any articles by him in medical
journals. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>‘s author index to current medical literature from
1900 to 1914, inclusive, fails to record any articles by Dr. Williams
in medical journals. Dr. Williams’ articles, however, in popular magazines
have been voluminous and numerous. Sometimes his articles have been
under his own name and sometimes under the nom de plume, “Stoddard
Goodhue, M.D.” Under the latter name the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> published articles on
“Adding Years to Your Life,” “Battle of the Microbes,” “Do You Choose
Your Children?” and “What is the Matter With Your Brain?” Under his
own name articles have appeared in popular magazines on such subjects as
“Burbank’s Way with Flowers,” “Every Woman Her Own Burbank,” “Why
Not Live Forever?” “Science of Breeding Kings,” “New Cancer Treatment”
and “New Hope for Rheumatism Sufferers.” In addition, Dr. Williams has
published books on such subjects as “History of the Art of Writing,” “Historians’
History of the World,” “Story of Nineteenth Century Science,”
“Luther Burbank,” “Twilight Sleep” and others. The Goodhue Company of
New York City, which publishes some of Dr. Williams’ books has, we understand,
for its president, Dr. Henry Smith Williams, for its vice president, Dr.
Williams’ wife, and for its secretary-treasurer, Dr. Williams’ daughter.</p>

<p>Readers of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> will remember the publicity given in 1915 and
1916 to an alleged treatment for cancer, sometimes called the “Horowitz-Beebe
Autolysin Treatment.” The method was heralded widely both in a certain
portion of the medical press and in popular magazines and newspapers. A
popular article by Henry Smith Williams on “The New Cancer Treatment”
appeared in the <i>Illustrated World</i> for October, 1915, with pictures of Dr.
Horowitz, Dr. Beebe, etc. A month or two later, physicians received, gratis,
from the Goodhue Company a neatly bound little book on “Alcohol Hygiene
and Legislation,” by E.&nbsp;H. Williams, M.D. (brother of Henry Smith Williams).
Enclosed with it was a letter from the Goodhue Company asking physicians to
accept the book. The body of the letter was devoted to calling the attention
of physicians to an “important work” by Dr. Henry Smith Williams on “The
Autolysin Treatment of Cancer” that the Goodhue Company was publishing.
With the letter, there was a small advertising pamphlet “Issued by the Autolysin
Laboratory” and advertising that product. In addition, the last thirteen
pages of the book on “Alcohol Hygiene” contained advertisements of the
Goodhue Company’s publications with particular emphasis (four pages of it)
on the “Autolysin Treatment of Cancer,” by Henry Smith Williams.</p>

<p>In May, 1917, physicians in the West received a letter from the “Ellison-White
Chautauqua System” informing them that Dr. Henry Smith Williams
was to lecture at “your Chautauqua” and reminding them that “he has recently
issued two volumes, ‘The Autolysin Treatment of Cancer’ which he believes
will be his greatest contribution to medical science.” The present “Proteal”
<span class="pagenum" title="445"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a></span>treatment appears to be a modification of the “Autolysin” treatment. Dr.
Williams, in attempting to justify the use of his “Proteal” in tuberculosis,
cancer, rheumatism, etc., takes advantage of certain investigations bearing on
the nonspecific reactions resulting from the parental injection of foreign
proteins. So far as we can discover, there is no scientific evidence to indicate
that the “Proteal” treatment expounded by Williams is of value in the treatment
of cancer, tuberculosis or the other numerous diseases for which the
“Proteals” are recommended.</p>

<p>It is a question whether such articles as those on “The Proteal Treatment
of Cancer,” “New Hope for Rheumatism Sufferers,” etc., published in popular
magazines or newspapers serve any useful public purpose. May they not, on
the contrary, by raising false hopes, cause much mental suffering and do
scientific medicine great harm?&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 6, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>PROTEOGENS</h3>

<h4>Commercial Therapeutics&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_P_268" id="FNanchor_P_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_268" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></h4>


<p>A report of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry that appears <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_253_269" id="FNanchor_253_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_269" class="fnanchor">253</a></span>
in this book deals with another attempt to foist on our profession a series of
essentially secret preparations whose therapeutic value has not been scientifically
demonstrated. Grotesquely extravagant claims are advanced as to the
therapeutic potency and range of action of substances of whose nature and
effects we have no trustworthy information. Physicians are advised to use&mdash;and
many undoubtedly are using&mdash;these alleged remedies in the treatment of
diseases in which delay in the proper kind of treatment may be of the greatest
danger to the patient. As stated, there is available no reliable information
regarding the effects of these substances when they are introduced in the
human body. They may have no effect whatever, or they may produce more
or less direct injury; in either case, there is the chance that damage, even
irreparable to the patient, may result because rational treatment is withheld.</p>

<p>If we accept the statement that the preparations are largely vegetable
proteins, it is a fair inference that, under certain conditions, they may cause
a febrile reaction of the same general nature as that caused by other foreign
proteins when injected into the body. We know that such reactions are not
without danger and that the treatment of certain infections by induced reactions
to foreign proteins is strictly an experimental procedure to be undertaken only
under very special conditions. There is, therefore, no known valid reason why
a physician should assume the responsibility for using these alleged remedies
in the treatment of his patients; there is a very obvious reason why he should
not&mdash;the therapeutic instructions of “the House of Merrell, always interested
in the progress of plant therapy” to the contrary notwithstanding. It is the
old story of exploiting physicians through commercial pseudoscience; of trading
on the credulity of the profession to the detriment of the public. As <span class="nowrap">Osler<a name="FNanchor_254_270" id="FNanchor_254_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_270" class="fnanchor">254</a></span>
recently protested so vigorously:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some time ago a pamphlet came from X and Company, characterized by brazen therapeutic
impudence, and indicating a supreme indifference to anything that could be called intelligence
on the part of the recipients. That these firms [manufacturing pharmacists] have the audacity
to issue such trash indicates the state of thraldom in which they regard us. And I would
protest against the usurpation on the part of these men of our function as teachers. Why, for
example, should Y and Company write as if they were directors of large genito-urinary clinics
instead of manufacturing pharmacists? It is none of their business what is the best treatment
for gonorrhea&mdash;by what possibility could they ever know it, and why should their literature
pretend to the combined wisdom of Neisser and Guyon? What right have Z and Company
<span class="pagenum" title="446"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a></span>to send on a card directions for the treatment of anemia and dyspepsia, about which subjects
they know as much as an unborn babe, and, if they stick to their legitimate business, about
the same opportunity of getting information? For years the profession has been exploited
in this way, until the evil has become unbearable, and we need as active a crusade against
the pseudoscience in the profession as has been waged of late against the use of quack medicines
by the public. We have been altogether too submissive, and have gradually allowed
those who should be our willing helpers to dictate terms and to play the rôle of masters.
<span class="smcap">Far too large a section of the treatment of disease is today controlled by the
big manufacturing pharmacists, who have enslaved us in a plausible pseudoscience.</span></p></div>

<p>What shall the profession do to protect itself against this humiliation&mdash;to
throw off the credulity that extols pseudoscience and makes commercialized
empiricism financially profitable? Osler says the remedy is obvious: “Give
our students a firsthand acquaintance with disease, and give them a thorough
practical knowledge of the great drugs, and we will send out independent,
clear-headed, cautious practitioners who will do their own thinking and be
no longer at the mercy of the meretricious literature, which has sapped our
independence.” Excellent! But must humanity wait a generation? Why
not stop this evil at once? The American Medical Association has provided
the means whereby this can be done, if physicians will only make use of it&mdash;the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal

<h4>An Alleged Endorsement of Proteogens Repudiated</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I note in the issue of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> for July 12, a statement
regarding the so-called “Proteogens” manufactured by the Wm. S. Merrell
Company of Cincinnati.</p>

<p>My attention has been called to the fact that salesmen of this company
have been exhibiting a letter purporting to show that this department has
endorsed their products in the treatment of venereal diseases. The letter in
question was written by a physician employed in one of the clinics conducted
jointly by this department and the U.&nbsp;S. Public Health Service, and the
stationery of the department was used without authority. The physician in
question has made numerous efforts to recall the letter, but the Merrell people
profess an inability to control its use.</p>

<p>I need not add that this department has not endorsed and will not endorse
these products, and has no evidence that they are of any value whatsoever.</p>

<h4>The Manufacturer’s Protest and a Reply</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Allow us to direct your attention to several misstatements
which appear in the letter signed, “Allen W. Freeman, M.D., Commissioner of
Health, State of Ohio,” published in <span class="smcap">The Journal of the American Medical
Association</span> for July 26.</p>

<p>1. Salesmen of this company have <i>not</i> been exhibiting a “letter purporting
to show that this department has endorsed their products in the treatment
of venereal diseases,” as stated by Dr. Freeman.</p>

<p>2. The author of the letter has <i>not</i> “made numerous efforts to recall the
letter, but the Merrell people profess an inability to control its use,” as stated
by Dr. Freeman.</p>

<p>A physician employed in one of the clinics used our Proteogens Nos. 10
and 11 extensively and is still using them to a large extent in his private
practice. He is a man of standing in the community in which he practices
and is also a professor in one of the leading medical colleges in the state.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="447"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a></span></p>
<p>The letter in question cites the case of a man who had been under treatment
for three years with 606, 914 and most of the other treatments in general
use, and on August 31, a year ago, still gave a Wassermann test plus 4.
He was given Proteogen No. 10, and by the middle of December the Wassermann
was negative and the man was discharged as cured.</p>

<p>While this letter was written on the stationery of the Bureau of Venereal
Diseases of the Department of Health, State of Ohio, it was written in the
first person, and made no pretension in any way to being official nor was any
such pretense made or authorized by the Merrell Company.</p>

<p>The author of the letter has <i>not</i> made “numerous efforts to recall the letter,”
nor has the Merrell Company “professed an inability to control its use.”</p>

<p>The physician did ask that the letter be returned to him, and his request
was complied with promptly.</p>

<p>[Then follows the full text of the letter in question. As its contents have
no bearing on the question under discussion, it is omitted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;The plain issue of veracity raised in the communication
of the Merrell Company must be settled on the evidence, which is unfortunately
too voluminous to be published in full in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. Copies of
the correspondence in the case have been furnished the editor, and the originals
are on file in the office of the state department of health in Columbus.</p>

<p>1. Whether or not the photographic reproduction of a letter written on the
letter head of this department, and the distribution of copies to salesmen for
display to physicians, was a conscious effort on the part of the firm in question
to create the impression that the letter was an official one is perhaps a matter
of inference. That it did create such an impression is evidenced by the letters
of inquiry received from physicians who saw it.</p>

<p>2. The statement that the Merrell Company refused to return the <i>letter</i> is
perhaps erroneous. They did apparently return the original letter but not
the <i>photographic copies</i> which had been distributed to their salesmen. On
May 22 the firm wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A number of physicians who are in cooperation with both state and national bureaus
of venereal diseases have been using our Proteogens with marked success and there are
doubtless many letters carried by our salesmen&mdash;reports from some of these physicians.”</p></div>

<p>This was interpreted to mean that the firm had no method of knowing
what letters were carried by their salesmen and was not responsible for them.
Whether or not this interpretation is correct is again, perhaps, a matter of
opinion.</p>

<p>The purpose of the original communication was to make plain to those of
the profession who have already seen or might subsequently see the letter
referred to that the communication was the expression of an individual and
not of the Department.</p>

<h4>Details of the Alleged Endorsement of Proteogens</h4>

<p>Our readers will remember the recent correspondence published in <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> of July 26 and September 6, by Dr. A.&nbsp;W. Freeman, Commissioner
<span class="pagenum" title="448"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a></span>of Health of the State of Ohio and the Wm. S. Merrell Co. The letters dealt
with the use that had been made by the Wm. S. Merrell Co. of a letter, written
on the official stationery of the Bureau of Venereal Diseases of the State
Department of Health of Ohio, puffing one of the company’s proprietary remedies&mdash;Proteogen
No. 10.</p>

<p>Dr. Freeman wrote to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> calling the attention of the profession
to the use of this letter and explaining that the letter was merely the expression
of opinion of an individual, and not an expression from the State Department
of Health. The Wm. S. Merrell Co. took exception to certain inferences
made in Dr. Freeman’s letter and in the course of a letter to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
regarding this, incorporated the contents of the testimonial letter. <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span>, in publishing the Merrell letter, omitted this testimonial on the ground
that the <i>contents</i> of the letter had no bearing on the question under discussion.</p>

<p>We have now received a letter from the company protesting against this
omission. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, therefore, takes this opportunity of briefly restating
such facts as it has been able to get regarding the entire matter and publishing
the letter. The facts are as follows:</p>

<p>1. In February of this year a Cincinnati physician, Dr. C.&nbsp;J. Broeman,
wrote to Dr. A.&nbsp;S. Horovitz relative to alleged results with Proteogen No. 10.
The letter was written&mdash;without authority&mdash;on the official stationery of the
Bureau of Venereal Diseases of the State Department of Health of Ohio.</p>

<p>2. The Wm. S. Merrell Co. had linen mounted photographs made of Dr.
Broeman’s letter and distributed them to their Proteogen detail men. Accompanying
these photographic copies was a communication to these detail men
describing the photographed letter as one written by:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. a Cincinnati physician who is now Acting Assistant Surgeon, U.&nbsp;S. Public
Health Service, cooperating with the Bureau of Venereal Diseases of the Department of
Health of the State of Ohio.”</p></div>

<p>3. The right hand top corner of the official stationery, as can be seen by
the reproduction, bore the name of “James D. Bauman, Deputy Commissioner.”
Dr. Broeman’s signature was rather illegible and could easily
be mistaken, by those not knowing the handwriting of either man, for the
signature of Deputy Commissioner Bauman. In at least one instance it was
so mistaken, and the physician who was misled wrote to the Director of the
Bureau asking whether the testimonial for Proteogen No. 10 which had been
shown him by the Merrell detail man was really an official communication.</p>

<p>4. On May 15, 1919, Commissioner of Health Freeman wrote to the Merrell
Co. stating that he had been informed that one of the Merrell representatives
was using as an advertisement a letter bearing the letterhead of the Bureau
of Venereal Diseases of the State Department of Health and what purported to
be a report signed by “Mr. Bauman, Deputy Commissioner.”</p>

<p>5. On May 19, the Wm. S. Merrell Co. wrote Dr. Freeman that he was
certainly mistaken in regard to the use of any “report signed by Mr. Bauman.”
Dr. Freeman then sent to the company the letter he had received from the
physician who had mistaken Broeman’s letter for an official letter by Bauman.
Although it would seem that this letter and Commissioner Freeman’s protest
should have made plain to the Wm. S. Merrell Co., the fact that the letter,
incorrectly referred to as Mr. Bauman’s, was in reality Dr. Broeman’s, the
company remained silent regarding its use of the Broeman letter and, on
May 22, merely reiterated that there had been “no letter circulated by this
company containing a testimonial of your Mr. Bauman.” On May 28 (six
days later) the Merrell company sent to its Proteogen detail men another
general letter, “for personal use of agents,” in which it again called their
attention to the “photographic copy mounted on linen” of Dr. Broeman’s letter.
<span class="pagenum" title="449"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a></span>This communication to the detail men also declared that it “has been suggested
that the further use of Dr. Broeman’s letter might antagonize the
State Department of Health” and, therefore the detail men were told to
“discontinue using the photographic copy in question” and to return the photographs
to the head office.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/449.jpg" width="530" height="665" alt="" />
<div>Reproduction (reduced) of one of the photographic copies sent out by the Wm. S. Merrell
Co. to its Proteogen detail men to be shown to physicians. While the letter is a private
one, it was written (without authority) on official stationery. Some physicians were misled
into thinking it was an official endorsement of Proteogens. The Merrell concern denied any
intention to mislead and claimed that it was interested only in bringing to the attention of
physicians the <i>contents</i> of the letter!</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="450"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a></span></p>

<p>Here, briefly are the bald facts in the case. The essential point at issue
is whether these photographic copies of Dr. Broeman’s letter would or would
not be likely&mdash;whether or not they were so intended&mdash;to mislead physicians
into believing that the endorsement was an official one by the State Board of
Health rather than an individual one. One can but wonder why, if, as the
Merrell company so vehemently asserts, there was no intention of misleading
physicians on this point, the company should have gone to the trouble
and expense of <i>photographing</i> the entire letter, including the letterhead, rather
than making typewritten or mimeographed copies of the <i>contents</i> of the letter.&mdash;(<i>From
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 27, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h4>Dr. Broeman’s Final Report on Proteogens</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;In the September 27 issue of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> my name was
mentioned in connection with the Merrell Chemical Company’s “Proteogens”
in the treatment of syphilis. The Merrell Chemical Company promised not
to use my name at any time in connection with their “Proteogens” injection
and they know that the use of my name has been distinctly against my wishes.
I feel that in justice to myself, as well as the public, I should report the result
of my experiments with their “Proteogens” in private practice.</p>

<p>In explanation I might say that I began the use of their “Proteogens” in
April, 1918, and I feel that I now have enough data to give a complete report.
I might say that all my results have been practically nil; particularly is this
true in my cases of syphilis, which all had a four plus Wassermann reaction
when I discontinued using this form of treatment.</p>

<p class="tac">Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">C. J. Broeman</span>, M.D., Cincinnati.</p>

<h3>PULVANE</h3>


<p>In a twelve-page pamphlet, sent out by the Pulvane Laboratories, Inc., of
Des Moines, Iowa, and purporting to deal with “The Therapy of Pulvane, an
advanced method for the treatment of Respiratory Diseases,” we are told that
Pulvane “was developed in a United States Army General Hospital by officers
of the Medical Department.”</p>

<p>Pulvane “originally was intended only for its germicidal action upon tubercle
bacilli in the lung,” but it is now also recommended for asthma, hay fever,
bronchitis, rhinitis, laryngitis and “other affections of the air passages.” Of
the alleged action of Pulvane on tuberculosis we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It destroys the spores of the bacilli as well as the germs themselves. It prevents infection
of new areas by aspiration, gravity or surface contact.</p>

<p>“In cases where sputum is positive it is a very noteworthy fact that shortly after treatment
is begun, the bacilli begin to disappear, gradually diminish in number, and finally the
sputum becomes negative.”</p></div>

<p>Pulvane is administered, by inhalation, at the offices of the Pulvane Laboratories,
Inc. Its “discoverer” chanced on a method of “introducing into
solution and volatizing a certain germicide, extremely rare in its usage because
of its resistance heretofore to attempts to bend it to scientific will.” This
“rare” medicament is alpha naphthol! But since the discovery of this volatizing
method “three other ingredients of high therapeutic value have been added.”
What are these other ingredients?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="451"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They would be named were it not that Pulvane requires special technique in its preparation
and administration. Our medical directors do not consider it advisable to identify them here
because of the possibility of incompetent hands attempting their use. The medical directors,
however, will be glad to name every ingredient of Pulvane for any reputable member of the
profession. Pulvane Laboratories reserve only the method of compounding.”</p></div>

<p>Presumably, therefore, if physicians desire to know what Pulvane is, the
Pulvane Laboratories, Inc., “will be glad to name every ingredient of Pulvane.”
It is worth noting that nothing is said about quantities. It is also worth
remembering that “Peruna” and some other “patient medicines” have for years
printed on the label the <i>names</i> of the alleged ingredients. How much longer is
the medical profession going to be fooled with the trick of nostrum exploiters
pretending a frankness that means nothing?</p>

<p>From a recent issue of a Des Moines newspaper we learn that the Pulvane
Laboratories are about to establish a sanatorium where the Pulvane treatment
can be given. This announcement is said to be made by John P. Mosher, the
alleged discoverer of Pulvane. Mosher is not a physician. The newspaper
article states, further, that Mosher’s experiments were tried out “under the
observation of Major Sharpe,” commander at Fort Des Moines. It appears also
that an ex-newspaper reporter is connected with the Pulvane Laboratories.
The value of having a good publicity man is obviously recognized. There also
seems to be connected with the concern a Dr. Harry P. Hall. We find in the
records reference to one Harry P. Hall who was graduated by the Medical
Department of Drake University of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1894, and was
licensed in Iowa in 1896. Our records indicate that he has not been in practice
for some years. We also find in our files some newspaper clippings regarding
a Dr. Harry P. Hall who, in 1914, pleaded guilty to a charge of using the mails
to defraud and was fined in the federal courts. Whether there is any connection
between these two names, we do not know.</p>

<p>Reverting to the claims made by the Pulvane Laboratories that Pulvane was
“developed in a United States Army General Hospital by officers of the Medical
Department” the following statement has recently been received by <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
from Surgeon-General Ireland of the United States Army:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been brought to my attention that a concern in Des Moines, Iowa,
known as the Pulvane Laboratories, has issued a pamphlet in which statements
are made which would naturally lead medical men to believe that the experiments,
etc., referred to therein were made with the approval of and more or
less under the direction of the Medical Department of the Army. I wish to
say that this is not so; that the Medical Department had nothing whatever to
do with the matter and that it thoroughly disapproves of the methods used by
the promoters of this concern.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 11, 1922.</i>)</p></div>

<h3>SAL HEPATICA</h3>


<p>Sal Hepatica is a saline laxative sold by the Bristol-Myers Company of
New York. Little information is given, or, apparently, ever has been given,
concerning the composition of this product. Many years ago the stock medical
journal advertisement contained this statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Sal Hepatica contains all of the Tonic, Alterative and Laxative Salts of
the celebrated ‘Bitter Waters’ of Europe, especially those of Bohemia, as determined by actual
chemical analysis of these waters, and fortified by the addition of Lithium and Sodium
Phosphates.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_255_271" id="FNanchor_255_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_271" class="fnanchor">255</a></span></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="452"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a></span></p>
<p>Sal Hepatica no longer “contains all the tonic, alterative and laxative
salts&nbsp;<span class="ell">...</span>,” etc., for the label on a package recently purchased reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sal Hepatica</span> is an effervescent saline combination possessing medicinal properties similar
to the natural ‘Bitter Waters’ of Europe, and fortified by the addition of Sodium Phosphate.”</p></div>

<p>In 1909, the <i>Druggists Circular</i> published an analysis of Sal Hepatica
which showed that the preparation contained only 0.04 per cent. of lithium
phosphate. By referring to the two quotations just given it will be noticed
that today the manufacturers make no claim that their preparation is fortified
with any salt of lithium. A circular accompanying recent trade packages
states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sal Hepatica is composed solely of harmless salts, being absolutely free from Acetanilid,
Phenacetin, Caffein, Calomel, opium or coal tar derivatives.”</p></div>

<p>Since neither the names nor the amounts of the “harmless salts” are mentioned,
the composition of Sal Hepatica is secret. It is a trick of the nostrum
exploiter, old but ever popular, to mention numerous drugs which his preparation
does <i>not</i> contain; it helps to distract attention from the fact that he does
not tell what the preparation <i>does</i> contain!</p>

<p>In the old-time medical journal advertisements, one reads, “Sal Hepatica
is the most powerful solvent of Uric Acid known.” (The same advertisement
as it appeared in those days in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> shows that claim toned down to,
“Sal Hepatica is a powerful solvent of Uric Acid.”) In those easy going
days, the Bristol-Myers Company declared that “diabetes is treated with
decided advantage by means of Sal Hepatica <span class="ell">..</span>. it <span class="ell">..</span>. possesses
the property of arresting the secretion of sugar in the liver.” In the old days,
too, Sal Hepatica was recommended in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver,
Bright’s disease, gravel, phthisis, etc.</p>

<p>The present advertising circular recommends Sal Hepatica as an eliminant,
laxative or cathartic in gout, autointoxication, “Bilious Attacks,” rheumatism,
acute indigestion, catarrhal conditions of the stomach, pyorrhea, headache,
dizziness, heart burn, “Summer Complaints,” “Derangements of the Stomach
and Liver,” skin diseases, colic, alcoholic excesses, and as a “preventive of
Seasickness.”</p>

<p>In 1914 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry <span class="nowrap">published<a name="FNanchor_256_272" id="FNanchor_256_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_272" class="fnanchor">256</a></span> a report on
Sal Hepatica declaring it secret in composition and sold under exaggerated
and unwarranted claims.</p>

<p>In view of the inquiries which <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> continues to receive it seemed
worth while to make a chemical examination of the present-day product.
Accordingly specimens were purchased and analyzed in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical
Laboratory. The report that follows was submitted by the chemists:</p>

<p>“Sal Hepatica is a white, granular, odorless powder. It effervesces on
the addition of water in which it eventually dissolves. The aqueous solution,
after boiling to remove carbon dioxid, has an acid reaction to litmus.</p>

<p>“Since a great many medicinal substances are sold in effervescent form,
and since practically no information is given by the manufacturer concerning
the composition of Sal Hepatica, it became necessary to test for a considerable
number of therapeutic agents. The absence of acetanilid, acetphenetidin, alkaloids,
ammonium salts, benzoates, caffein, citrates, heavy metals, hexa­methylen­amin,
magnesium, potassium, salicylates and sugars was demonstrated by
appropriate tests. The presence of a carbonate (probably in the form of a
bicarbonate), a phosphate, a sulphate, a chlorid, tartaric acid, sodium and
traces of lithium was shown by qualitative tests.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="453"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a></span></p>
<p>“Quantitative analysis indicated that the composition of the specimens
examined was essentially as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium phosphate, anhydrous</span></div></td><td class="tar pl03">&#8199;4.4&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per cent.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>“From the results of the analysis, it appears probable that the composition
of the mixture before ‘granulation’ was approximately as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium phosphate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">&#8199;4&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">per cent.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>“Sal Hepatica, therefore, is essentially an effervescing mixture of dried
sodium sulphate (Glauber’s salt) and sodium tartrate with a little dried sodium
phosphate and table salt added. It is similar to the effervescent artificial
Carlsbad Salt described in the National Formulary.</p>

<p>“In 1909 the <i>Druggists Circular</i> published the following analysis of Sal
Hepatica:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots2"><span class="item">Sodium phosphate</span></div></td><td class="tar pl05">29.80&nbsp;</td><td class="tal">parts</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>“A comparison of the recent analysis with the earlier one would seem to
indicate that considerable changes have been made in the formula since the
first examination. The proportions of sodium phosphate have been greatly
reduced, while the sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid have been increased
and the citric acid entirely eliminated.”</p>

<p>Sal Hepatica, then, is a simple effervescent saline laxative, essentially
secret in composition and sold under claims that would be laughed at were the
full formula of the product a matter of public knowledge.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal

<h3>SALICON</h3>


<p>“Salicon” is marketed by the K.&nbsp;A. Hughes Company, Boston, as “an
improved aspirin.” In a circular sent out to the public a little over a year
ago the following claims were made for it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We rendered aspirin absolutely harmless and yet retained all its virtues as a medicine.”</p>

<p>“It positively will not depress the heart nor upset the stomach no matter how large
amounts of it are taken.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the Massachusetts state medical authorities <span class="ell">..</span>. adopted its use at all the
state camps for fighting the Spanish influenza<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The first two statements quoted above are obviously false. The third
statement might have been true although it seemed unlikely. A letter was,
therefore, written to the Department of Public Health of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts and the claim of the K.&nbsp;A. Hughes Company relative to the
<span class="pagenum" title="454"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></span>adoption of Salicon in all the state camps by the “state medical authorities”
was brought to their attention. The reply of the department on this point was
emphatic:</p>

<p>“The State Department of Health of Massachusetts did not endorse the
use of Salicon for any purpose.”</p>

<p>Some Salicon was purchased on the open market and submitted to the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Chemical Laboratory for analysis. Here is the chemists’ report.</p>

<p>“One original bottle of ‘Salicon’ (K.&nbsp;A. Hughes Company, Boston) was
submitted by the Propaganda department of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> to the Association’s
Chemical Laboratory for examination. The bottle contained 100 white tablets
having an average weight of 0.407 gram (6.3 grains), each. The amount of
ash was 20.9 per cent. Qualitative tests indicated the presence of magnesium,
carbonate, starch, acetyl­salicylic acid and a trace of calcium; a very small
amount of a petrolatum-like substance was present. Alkaloids and drugs used
for a laxative effect were not found. The amount of acetyl­salicylic acid
extracted by chloroform was 50.7 per cent. The amount of magnesium present
as magnesium oxid was 14.3 per cent. The amount of magnesium oxid derived
from magnesium carbonate U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. is variable; but calculating on the lowest
limit, 14.3 per cent. of magnesium oxid is equivalent to at least 35.5 per cent.
of magnesium carbonate. This figure agreed closely with that obtained from
the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., method of assay. The acetyl­salicylic acid was not combined with
the magnesium. From the above, it may be stated that each tablet consisted
essentially of a mixture of 3.2 grains of acetyl­salicylic acid (aspirin), 2.2
grains of magnesium carbonate and some starch. Although labeled 5 grains,
each tablet did not contain 5 grains of the most active ingredient, acetyl­salicylic
acid.”</p>

<p>The same old story. An ordinary mixture of well known drugs put on the
market as a new discovery and foisted on the public under false and misleading
claims.&mdash;(<i>Correspondence in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 5, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>SO-CALLED SECRETIN PREPARATIONS</h3>


<p>In China the administration of powdered tiger-bone is&mdash;or was&mdash;a favorite
form of treatment in cases of supposed cardiac weakness. The theory is,
presumably, that the cardiac strength of the tiger would be a good thing for
the patient to acquire. Since many patients have recovered after taking tiger-bone,
and no one has proved that they might not have died had they failed to
take it, “clinical experience” stands back of the treatment; and where is the
skeptic so rash as to challenge that? The Chinese physician believes in his
tiger-bone therapy, and, with the best interests of his patient at heart, insists
on obtaining absolutely true and authentic tiger-bone. Not satisfied with
the assertions of the dealers, the conscientious Chinese physician subjects his
tiger-bone to a kind of physiologic standard­ization. He offers the bone
in question to a dog! If it is an ox-bone&mdash;a frequent form of substitution&mdash;the
dog will seize and eagerly gnaw it, whereas, according to all the teachings
of Chinese pharmacognosy, if it is a tiger-bone the dog will depart hurriedly
with his tail between his legs. Very foolish? Yes! But before we smile
superciliously at the Chinese medical man, let us turn to the report of the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry on “So-Called Secretin Preparations.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_257_273" id="FNanchor_257_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_273" class="fnanchor">257</a></span>
After reading this report let us put to ourselves, squarely and honestly, the
question: Has the attitude toward secretin therapy, of a certain portion of
those who represent Western modern medicine, really been much more scientific
than that of the Chinese medical profession toward tiger-bone therapy? On
<span class="pagenum" title="455"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></span>the basis of a hypothesis scarcely less crude and unsubstantiated than that
which assumes that tiger-bone is of value in heart disease, it has been assumed
that secretin is of value in gastro-intestinal diseases. On the ground of
“clinical evidence” scarcely more critical than that exhibited by our confrères
in the antipodes, it has been asserted that alleged secretin preparations
actually are efficious. Indeed, in one respect the methods of the Chinese
physician appear more scientific than those of his Western brethren. To
the best of his ability, the Oriental at least makes sure that he is administering
genuine tiger-bone; he does not rely on the unverified word of his dealer
alone. The American physician has not been making the least effort to ascertain
whether his supposed secretin preparations are truly such; and, as a matter
of fact, scientific investigation seems to indicate that some of these products
contained no secretin at all! Whatever one may think of the validity of his
test, the Chinese physician does his best according to his lights. As to
“clinical experience,” Dr. Jacobi has well said that some people make the
same mistake a hundred times and call it “experience.”&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The

<h3>SUCCUS CINERARIA MARITIMA</h3>

<h4>Another Illustration of One of the Weaknesses of the Federal Food
and Drugs Act</h4>


<p>The Walker Pharmacal Company of St. Louis was, we understand, if it is
not still, one of the subsidiary concerns of the Luyties Homeopathic Pharmacy
Company. It has for years sold a nostrum, “Succus Cineraria Maritima,”
under the claim that by simply dropping this stuff into the eye, twice daily,
cataract and other opacities of the eye will be cured. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. the only remedy for the relief of cataract and other opacities of vision, which
stands before the medical fraternity on a firm foundation of accomplished results<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. possesses a specific power in removing the obstruction to vision.”</p>

<p>“In this class of cases [cataract] physicians can place reliance on Succus Cineraria Maritima
(Walker) which does not require the services of a specialist but is simply dropped into
the eye with an ordinary medicine dropper twice daily<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. has been used with success in cataract, both lenticular and capsular, pterygium
and opacities of the cornea, softening the opaque deposits, causing dissolution, and by its
stimulating properties, hastening absorption.”</p></div>

<p>Succus Cineraria Maritima is advertised to the medical profession in true
“patent medicine” style by means of testimonials from doctors, obscure and
deceased. The preparation is valueless for the purposes for which it is sold
and “has about as much effect on the dissolution or dispersal of opacities due
to organic changes in the lens as pouring the same down the back of the
patient’s neck!” More than five years ago the Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry reported on the worthlessness of the drug, Cineraria maritima, and,
at the same time, <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> pointed out that the drug would have been
forgotten long ago had it not been for the prodigal use of printers’ ink by
the Walker Pharmacal Company in advertising its Succus Cineraria Maritima.</p>

<p>These facts are given for the purpose of refreshing the memory of our
readers and are but incidental to the object of this article. In due time the
federal authorities proceeded against the Walker Pharmacal Company charging
that Succus Cineraria Maritima was misbranded under the federal Food and
Drugs Act. The government chemists reported that analysis “showed that
the product was essentially an aqueous solution of glycerin, boric acid and
vegetable drug extractives carrying tannin-like bodies.” The direct and
inferential claims made in the advertising matter accompanying the trade
package were quoted by the federal authorities, who pointed out that the
Walker Pharmacal Company was selling the nostrum under claims that
<span class="pagenum" title="456"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a></span>would create in the minds of the purchasers the belief that Succus Cineraria
Maritima was a remedy for cataract and other opacities of the eye causing
impaired vision and that it was a cure for senile cataract, trachoma, secondary
opacities, etc. These claims the government charged were “false and fraudulent
in that the same were applied to the article knowingly, and in reckless and
wanton disregard of their truth or falsity,” because “in truth and in fact it
was not, in whole or in part, composed of, and did not contain, such ingredients
and medicinal agents” as would produce the therapeutic effects claimed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/456.jpg" width="375" height="517" alt="" />
<div>Facsimile of a letter, dated October, 1916, suggesting the use of “Succus Cineraria Maritima”
as a cure for cataract and other opacities of vision. Eight months previously (February,
1916), the Walker Pharmacal Company had pleaded guilty to the charge that the claims that
“Succus Cineraria Maritima” was a cure for cataract and other eye opacities were false and
fraudulent and applied knowingly and in reckless and wanton disregard of their truth or
falsity. The federal Food and Drugs Act does not apply to claims made in circular letters
or elsewhere than in the trade package.</div>
</div>

<p>These charges put the matter flatly up to the Walker Pharmacal Company.
This company has for years been telling physicians that their stuff <i>could</i> and
<i>would</i> do just what the federal authorities insisted it can <i>not</i> and will <i>not</i> do.
Did the Walker Pharmacal Company attempt to defend its claims? Did it
demonstrate that Succus Cineraria Maritima would cure cataract? Did it
produce evidence of the numerous cases of recovery from blindness or partial
<span class="pagenum" title="457"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a></span>blindness which must have been available if the preparation had the powers
claimed for it? No! The Walker Pharmacal Company in February, 1916,
pleaded guilty&mdash;and was fined a paltry $10 and costs.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the end of the story. The company was prosecuted
because it had published the false and fraudulent claims in the trade package,
thus bringing the claims within the purview of the federal Food and Drugs
Act. Had the Walker Pharmacal Company confined its false statements to
medical journal advertisements, to the circular letters sent to physicians or
to any other advertising matter not part of the trade package, it could have
snapped its fingers at the Food and Drugs Act.</p>

<p>It was in February, 1916, that the Walker Pharmacal Company pleaded
guilty to the charge of making false and fraudulent claims for Succus Cineraria
Maritima. In October, 1916, they were still sending out circular letters to
physicians urging the use of Succus Cineraria Maritima in the treatment of
cataract and enclosing the usual booklet of testimonials claiming cures for
cataract and other opacities of the lens and cornea!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/457.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" />
<div>Facsimile of some of the pages from the booklet that accompanied the letter reproduced
herewith. The obvious intent of this booklet was to lead physicians to believe that Succus
Cineraria Maritima will cure “Opacity of the Cornea,” “Opacity of the Lens,” “Senile Cataract,”
“Incipient Cataract,” “Double Cataract,” etc.</div>
</div>

<p>Can one conceive a better illustration of the inadequacy of the Food and
Drugs Act? The dishonest exploiter of proprietary medicines cares little
that the law requires him to keep within certain bounds of truthfulness in the
advertising that accompanies the trade package. It isn’t the claims in the
trade packages that sell the product; it’s the advertising in medical journals, in
circular letters, etc. Yet, the Food and Drugs Act offers no check or curb on
false statements or fraudulent claims made for proprietary or “patent medicines”
in any other place than the trade packages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="458"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a></span></p>
<p>A few weeks ago <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> called attention to a flagrant case of fraud;
and at that time it said, “It is justifiable to assume that when any man, whatever
his business, admits in court that he has made fraudulent claims and then
continues to make the same claims through channels that are not controlled
by penal enactment, that man’s standard of business ethics is such that the
public needs protection against it. There are many such men in the ‘patent
medicine’ world. The only way in which the public may properly be protected
against being defrauded in such cases is for the federal Food and Drugs Act to
have its scope extended to cover <i>all</i> advertising of the products coming under
the purview of the act.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 17, 1917.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>TEKARKIN</h3>

<h4>Edward Percy Robinson’s “Cure” for Cancer</h4>


<p>From various parts of the country <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has received a sixteen
page pamphlet, <i>Therapeutic Leaves</i>. The publication, which has a saffron
colored cover, is said to be published by the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory,
Mount Vernon, N.&nbsp;Y. The National Bio-Chemical Laboratory seems to be
a style used by Dr. Edward Percy Robinson. The “editorial offices” of
<i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> are given as “501 Knox Bldg., 5th Ave. at 40th St., New
York,” which is a roundabout way of describing 452 Fifth Ave., the office
address of Edward Percy Robinson. The first number (February, 1921) of
<i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> gives the names of the “editors” as “E.&nbsp;P. Robinson, M.D.,
<span class="pagenum" title="459"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a></span>and W.&nbsp;A. Jenner, B.A.” In addition, there is “Assistant Editor, F.&nbsp;J. Geiger,”
and “Gen’l Manager, Beverly K. Robinson.” The first and second numbers
of <i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> (February and March, 1921) are practically identical,
being evidently printed from the same plates. <i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> purports to
be a periodical published as “a medium for the dissemination of knowledge,
pertaining to therapeusis.” Actually, it is an advertising medium dealing with
the products of the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory: “Osmo-Calcic Solution,”
“Tekarkin” and “Osmotic Mangano-Potassic Solution.”</p>

<p>These preparations are said to be the “formulas” of Dr. Edward Percy
Robinson who lives in Mt. Vernon, N.&nbsp;Y., and has an office at 452 Fifth Ave.,
New York City. They are used by Dr. Robinson in the treatment of cancer.
At an earlier stage they seem to have been known under different names:
“Tekarkin” was first “Hypotonic Sal-Cella” and then “Neoanabolin-X;” “Osmo-Calcic
Solution” was “Osmotonic Calcic” while “Osmotic Mangano-Potassic
Solution” was “Osmotonic Drops.” The three solutions are put up in one
package containing 4&nbsp;c.c. (about 65 minims) of “Tekarkin” and 1 ounce each
of the other preparations. The package sells for $10.00. “Remittance with
order <span class="ell">..</span>. We have no agents.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/459.jpg" width="410" height="296" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Most of the material in <i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> is a rehash of four papers
published by Edward Percy Robinson in the New York <i>Medical Record</i> of
various dates between September, 1917, and July, 1920. In these Robinson
advances the theory that cancer is caused by an excess of sodium chlorid
(table salt) in the blood and tissues and that it can be cured by administering
a solution of potassium nitrate. Such a treatment sounds ideally simple.
One might assume that all that was necessary was to make up a solution of
potassium nitrate and inject it. One might further wonder how it would be
possible to commercialize such a “treatment.” “Homemade solutions,” says
Dr. Robinson, “are apt to be disappointing.” Their use is likely to cause
“considerable swelling at the site of an injection, accompanied with tenderness
and some heat.” Moreover, “a wide hyperemic area with red blotches
has been observed in a number of instances.” In order to avoid “accidents
of this sort” which would “bring discredit upon an excellent agent,” Dr.
Robinson, “after considerable experimental work” has obtained “a solution
of this chemical which would meet the ideal requirements.” This is available
<span class="pagenum" title="460"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a></span>under the name “Tekarkin.” Dilute potassium nitrate solution sold under
the name “Tekarkin” sells for $67 an ounce. The physician can make his
own solution, of the purest and highest grade potassium nitrate on the market,
at an expense, for the chemical, not exceeding 5 cents an ounce.</p>

<p><i>Therapeutic Leaves</i> also contains the usual number of those “clinical reports”
which bulk so large in the literature of “cures” for cancer. Then there is a
full page advertisement of a side-line of the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory:
“Vitamines (Compressed) Tekarkin Brand;” “They have a meaty taste.”</p>

<p>The medical profession, naturally, is interested in knowing more about
the physician who admits that he has discovered the cause and cure of cancer.
According to our records, Edward Percy Robinson was born in 1871 and was
graduated in 1897 by Bellevue Hospital Medical College. He was licensed
in New York State the same year and has practiced in New York City continuously
since that time. He is not, and apparently never has been, a member
of his local medical society.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/458.jpg" width="315" height="405" alt="" />
<div>Reproduction (reduced) of some advertising matter issued in 1914 when Edward Percy
Robinson was specializing in “facial contouring.”</div>
</div>

<p>In 1914 Robinson was specializing in “facial contouring.” One piece of
advertising purports to be the reprint of an interview with “Dr. E.&nbsp;P. Robinson,
Specialist, as he sat in his office at 116 West 39th Street, having questions
fired at him by the reporter.” Thus Dr. Robinson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are physicians everywhere who abandon the general, or family, practice of medicine,
to devote their life to some specialty. My specialty is the improvement of the facial
features and the beautifying of the shoulders, neck and arms. I round out hollow cheeks,
build up the neck, eradicate wrinkles, make irregular noses perfect and remove defects by a
<span class="pagenum" title="461"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a></span>process which is my own secret. I claim no superhuman power or ability; I have simply
bent my whole professional study and energy to the one line of remodeling&mdash;so to speak&mdash;the
human features, and I employ only scientific methods and aids in my operations.”</p></div>

<p>In another piece of advertising, a little booklet bearing Edward Percy
Robinson’s name, we find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is what I accomplish<span class="ell">...</span>.</p>

<p>“Remove all wrinkles and traces of age from the forehead, or about the eyes and mouth.
Lift sag from cheeks and chin.</p>

<p>“Round out hollow cheeks.</p>

<p>“Remove depressions and defects from the chin.</p>

<p>“Build up the neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Build up and enlarge the bust.</p>

<p>“Round out and give symmetry to unshapely arms and remove the lines of age from the
hands.</p>

<p>“Correct many of the defects not mentioned here, but which may be possessed by exceptional
cases.”</p></div>

<p>Still another advertising leaflet purports to be a reprint of an “editorial”
from the <i>Mercantile and Financial Times</i> of March 11, 1914. It is a pretentious
puff of Robinson, telling about his “scientific attainments” and his marvelous
secret preparations used in “Youthifying the Face.” The <i>Mercantile and
Financial Times</i> is an utterly discredited sheet run for the purpose of selling
what appear to be editorial comments. Such “editorial” puffs are paid for
through the purchase of a certain number of copies of the paper by the party
who desires the publicity. The Associated Advertising Clubs of the World
exposed this publication in a special bulletin issued in June, 1919, and described
it as an “example of publications that serve as convenient tools of fake promoters.”
In 1911 the <i>Mercantile and Financial Times</i> published an “editorial”
endorsement of the consumption cure “Nature’s Creation.” It has done the
same for a fakish device known as the “Ideal Sight Restorer.” It published
a puff on the “Oxypathor,” a swindle so preposterous that the exploitation of
this “gaspipe” fake was debarred from the U.&nbsp;S. mails and its exploiter was
sent to the federal penitentiary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/460.jpg" width="325" height="427" alt="" />
<div>Reproduction (reduced) of a testimonial for an obesity cure fake, “Get Slim.” The
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. chemists reported that this “vegetable combination” consisted of baking soda and
pink-tinted tartaric acid and sugar.</div>
</div>

<p>We also find in our files a testimonial signed E.&nbsp;P. Robinson, M.D., 1402
Broadway (Edward Percy Robinson’s address in 1912), extolling the virtues
of a foolish piece of quackery, the obesity cure “Get Slim.” This nostrum
was exposed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> some years ago and was also exposed by Dr.
Wiley in <i>Good Housekeeping</i>. The “Get Slim” concern sued <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
for libel but a jury decided that <i>Good Housekeeping</i> had told the truth. In the
“Get Slim” testimonial Robinson is quoted as saying that he is “acquainted
with the ingredients entering into its manufacture” and he describes it, as did
the “Get Slim” concern, as “a purely vegetable combination.” The fact is the
Association’s chemists found this “purely vegetable combination” to consist
of sugar and tartaric acid, each colored pink, and baking soda.</p>

<p>And this is the gentleman who claims to have discovered the cause of,
and offers for sale a cure for, one of the most baffling scourges known to
modern medicine&mdash;cancer. Except for the articles that have been published
during the past three years in the <i>Medical Record</i>, we are unable to find anywhere
in representative medical literature anything to indicate that Edward
Percy Robinson can lay any claim to special knowledge of, or skill in the
treatment of, cancer. What we do find are advertisements describing Edward
Percy Robinson’s alleged abilities as a “face beautifier,” puffs from utterly
uncritical or discredited sources and a testimonial to the value of a preposterous
“fat cure” fake.</p>

<p>With the best brains of the world at work on the problem of cancer, it is
reasonable to assume that any man who has found out even a little more
<span class="pagenum" title="462"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a></span>than has previously been discovered or is able to accomplish even a little better
results than the average in the treatment of this dreaded disease, would be
well known to scientific medicine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this article was in type physicians began sending in No. 3 (April,
1921) of <i>Therapeutic Leaves</i>. This is still another reprint of Nos. 1 and 2,
with minor changes. In the first two, Tekarkin is described as “a solution of
potassium nitrate of special strength;” in No. 3 it becomes “a special solution
containing potassium nitrate.” In Nos. 1 and 2, Robinson described an alleged
case of “Cancer of the Rectum <i>Treated</i> with Tekarkin.” In No. 3 this becomes
“Medicinal Treatment <i>Cures</i> Cancer of the Rectum.” In No. 3 the names of
the editors, assistant editor and general manager are eliminated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/462.jpg" width="400" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The inside back cover of No. 3 contains an advertisement of Tekarkin, in
which physicians are warned that “Cancer of the Lung May Present Diagnostic
Signs of Tuberculosis.” It contains the further startling information that the
particular micro-organism responsible for pulmonary tuberculosis is the Klebs-Loeffler
bacillus! Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Klebs-Loeffler bacillus may find a suitable habitat in a malignant area of lung tissue
and thrive therein. The presence of the bacillus does not necessarily exclude the presence of
cancer. A chronic cough with blood-streaked sputum may be the result of tuberculosis and
cancer.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 28, 1921.</i>)</p></div>

<h3>TYREE’S ANTISEPTIC POWDER AGAIN</h3>

<h4>The “Ethical and Commercial Requirements” of the Drug Business</h4>


<p>“I am fond of the retail drug business and follow it every day of my life. I
know and observe to the fullest extent its ethical and commercial requirements.”
This from a circular letter recently received by physicians, and signed J.&nbsp;S.
Tyree, who asks that he be forgiven for writing you personally, but there are
several reasons why he thinks the circumstances warrant it. All of which is
preliminary to calling attention to an enclosure, which accompanies the circular
letter, and is described as a “short memorandum” submitted for “your
consideration.”</p>

<p>The “memorandum” is a four-page leaflet of which three pages are devoted
to “Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder.” One of these three pages is a reproduction of
a letter on the stationery of the Surgeon General’s Office of the War Department,
and signed “W.&nbsp;M. Gray, M.D., Microscopist, Army Medical Museum;
<span class="pagenum" title="463"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a></span>Pathologist to Providence Hospital.” The letter describes a series of “bacteriological
and comparative tests” made by Dr. Gray with Tyree’s Antiseptic
Powder. The entire second page of the circular is given over to the results
of these bacteriologic tests which compare various strengths of Tyree’s Antiseptic
Powder with “mercuric bichlorid,” phenol and formaldehyde.</p>

<p>The physicians who received this advertising material in April, 1919, might
easily overlook the fact that Dr. Gray has been dead several years, that the
letter which is reproduced is dated Jan. 3, 1890, and that the bacteriologic tests
were made in 1889&mdash;thirty years ago!</p>

<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry in <span class="nowrap">1906<a name="FNanchor_258_274" id="FNanchor_258_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_274" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> published the results of an
analysis of Tyree’s Antiseptic Powder which showed that although the stuff
was advertised as a mixture of borax and alum, it was in fact essentially a
mixture of zinc sulphate and boric acid. The publication of the Council’s
report in 1906, showing the falsity of the formula, brought out the admission
that the composition had recently been changed. Certain it is, however, that
for at least a decade past, the Tyree product has been a zinc sulphate-boric
acid preparation. Yet, according to the manufacturer’s own statement, Tyree’s
Antiseptic Powder in 1889, when Dr. Gray made his bacteriologic tests, was an
entirely different substance from the present mixture.</p>

<p>Here then we have a manufacturer publishing in 1919, in behalf of a
certain product, tests that were made in 1889 with a product of different composition,
although of the same name! Is this observing “to the fullest extent”
the “ethical and commercial requirements” of the “retail drug business”?</p>

<p>There is no scientific excuse for such a mixture as Tyree’s Antiseptic
Powder. If, however, physicians feel that they must use an irrational conglomeration
such as this, why not prescribe Pulvis Antisepticus, N.&nbsp;F.? Like
the Tyree product, this, too, is essentially a mixture of zinc sulphate and boric
acid, with minute amounts of phenol, eucalyptol, menthol and thymol, to say
nothing of a dash of salicylic acid. This official article has at least the virtue
of constancy of strength, composition and purity assured under the federal
Food and Drugs Act.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 17, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>WHEELER’S TISSUE PHOSPHATES</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Commissioner of Health directs me to call to your attention the enclosed advertisement
issued by T.&nbsp;B. Wheeler, M.D., Company, Montreal, Canada, in which the name of the
Association’s <i>Journal</i> is being used.”</p></div>

<p>Accompanying this brief note to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> from the secretary of Dr.
Haven Emerson, Commissioner of the Department of Health of the City of
New York, was a four page leaflet devoted to the exploitation of “Wheeler’s
Tissue Phosphates.” The trend of the circular is to lead the average reader
to infer that <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of the American Medical Association has endorsed
Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates. For example, in describing the preparation one
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It embodies <span class="ell">..</span>. the best recent scientific opinion concerning the treatment of the
disease (tuberculosis) as stated <span class="ell">..</span>. by the official <span class="smcap">Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Elsewhere in the circular <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s criticisms of the hypo­phosphites
and the glycero­phosphates (proprietary preparations which are competitors of
the Wheeler product) are quoted and twisted into a tribute to the ingredients
<span class="pagenum" title="464"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></span>of Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates. Garbling quotations, distorting statements,
separating phrases from their contexts and omitting qualifying clauses, all for
the purpose of making out a case for some proprietary remedy is a trick as
old as quackery itself. That it should be used in advertising Wheeler’s Tissue
Phosphates is entirely fitting. Obviously, the T.&nbsp;B. Wheeler, M.D., Company
esteems the opinion of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> on pharmacologic matters. This being
the case, it should, in the interest of truth and scientific accuracy, publish in
its advertising circulars just what <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has said about Wheeler’s
Tissue Phosphates. It could not do this better than by quoting from a recent
editorial note which commented on a report of the Chemical Laboratory on
this preparation. Here is part of the <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“&#8239;‘Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates’ is an unscientific shotgun mixture whose most active and
powerful drug is the alcohol it contains. That it was not years ago relegated to the realms
of obsolete and discarded preparations is a commentary alike on the lack of scientific discrimination
and on the power of advertising.”</p></div>

<p>Here we have “Wheeler’s Tissue Phosphates” stripped of the verbal
camouflage with which its exploiters have invested it.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 22, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h4>Calcidin Tablets (Abbott)</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;What is the composition of calcidin tablets (Abbott) and what is their
value?</p>

<p class="sig">J. S.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Calcidin is claimed to be a mixture of iodin, lime and starch. In
contact with water, the iodin and lime react to form calcium iodid and calcium
iodate. By the acid of the gastric juice, the calcium iodid and calcium iodate
are decomposed with liberation of free iodin. The administration of calcidin
tablets amounts to giving free (elementary) iodin. In the past, the advertising
for calcidin has contained the unwarranted claim more or less directly
that it was the most effective and only noninjurious preparation of iodin for
internal use, and that it possesses all of the valuable properties of the iodin
with all of the objectionable effects left out. So far as we know, the effects
produced by the administration of free iodin do not differ from those produced
by the administration of iodids and, therefore, calcidin has no advantage over
the iodids, such as sodium iodid.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 25,

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Di-Crotalin is a rattlesnake venom preparation sold by the Swan-Myers
Company of Indianapolis as a “Treatment for Epilepsy, Chorea, Bronchial
Asthma, Chronic or Hereditary Nervous Headache, Nervous Prostration
Incident to Change of Life, Hysteria-Mania, Insomnia, Neurasthenia, etc.” Dr.
Thomas J. Mays of Philadelphia advocated the use of rattlesnake venom for
tuberculosis. Later his former assistant, Dr. R.&nbsp;H. Spangler, used the same
material in the treatment of epilepsy. That any measure of success sufficient
to justify the adoption of the rattlesnake venom or crotalin treatment for
epilepsy has resulted is not to be concluded from the available reports. Still
less evidence is there for the use of rattlesnake venom in the list of conditions
for which the Swan-Myers Company has recommended its preparation. There
are a number of good reasons why a cautious physician will shun the administration
of this treatment and advise against it. J.&nbsp;F. Anderson, working
in the hygienic laboratory of the United States Public Health Service, reported
a death from the crotalin treatment in consequence of infection, and reports
that the market supply of crotalin solution and crotalin tablets is highly contaminated.
He also found both crotalin and crotalin solution to vary in
<span class="pagenum" title="466"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a></span>activity. The use of rattlesnake venom was discussed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, March

<h4>Estivin</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;What is “Estevin,” or something like that? It is said to be good in
hay-fever.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Constant Reader.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The product called “Estivin” is sold by Schieffelin and Company,
New York. A request for a statement of the composition of this preparation
sent to Schieffelin and Company by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
brought the indefinite and, therefore, meaningless statement that “&#8239;‘Estivin’ is
an extract of Rosa Gallica containing no alcoholic or foreign ingredients.”&mdash;(<i>Query

<h4>Iron Arsenite</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Can you inform me how iron arsenite can be prepared for subcutaneous
injection? A commercial firm furnishes physicians with ampules of arsenite of iron. Is this
really arsenite of iron?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">S. H. Kempner, M.D.</span>, New York.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Ferric arsenite (iron arsenite) is in itself relatively insoluble in
water, but may be treated with ammonium citrate, the resulting product thus
being soluble; the latter substance was at one time described in New and
Non­official Remedies as “Ferric Arsenite, Soluble” and is sometimes sold as
a solution in ampule form. In 1912, the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
deleted “Ferric Arsenite, Soluble” from New and Non­official Remedies because
“one cannot, in administering Ferric Arsenite, Soluble, give a useful dose of
iron without giving too much arsenic; and, vice versa, one cannot give a safe
dose of arsenic without giving too little iron.” The Council, therefore, held
the preparation to be irrational and unscientific.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal

<h4>K-Y Lubricating Jelly</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;1. What is the composition of “K-Y Lubricating Jelly”?
2. Can you furnish a formula for a simple nongreasy lubricating jelly?</p>

<p class="sig">S. T.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;1. The composition of “K-Y Lubricating Jelly” has not been
divulged. Examination of the advertising matter reveals only meaningless
statements, such as: “This is a judicious combination of vegetable products <span class="ell">..</span>.
Combined in well balanced proportions with non-irritating antiseptics<span class="ell">...</span>,”
“It incorporates a sufficient quantity of mild antiseptics
(of the Thymol class)&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” and “<span class="ell">..</span>. contains <i>NO</i> formaldehyde.”</p>

<p>2. Probably a simple tragacanth jelly, which can be made cheaply, will
produce the same effects as those of the proprietary preparation. The following
formula was published by Mr. J.&nbsp;K. Thum, apothecary at the German
Hospital, Philadelphia (<i>Druggists Circular</i>, September, 1915, p.&nbsp;586):</p>

<h4>“Nikalgin”</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;<i>Collier’s</i> has a special article this week on “Nikalgin.” Have you any

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">P. R. Minahan, M.D.</span>, Fond du Lac, Wis.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;“Nikalgin” is said to be the “invention” of Gordon Edwards, an
engineer. Large claims for its anesthetic and antiseptic virtues have been
made. While no very definite information seems to be forthcoming regarding
the preparation, it has been said to be “composed of quinin, hydrochloric acid
and urea.” This would indicate that “Nikalgin” may be nothing more wonderful
than the well known local anesthetic, quinin and urea hydrochlorid, the
<i>Quininae et Ureae Hydrochloridum</i> of the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia, or a modification
of it.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 22, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Pertussin and Syrup of Thyme</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;A short time ago I received a sample of “Pertussin” and used some in an
obstinate case of bronchitis with excellent results. I have since received a catalog from a
pharmaceutical firm, which advertises syrup of thyme. I have searched for a formula to
make my own syrup of thyme, but have not been able to find one. Will you publish one?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">E. F. Benner, M.D.</span>, Salfordville, Pa.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The subjoined formula yields a product very similar to “Pertussin”
in taste, flavor, composition, and probably in activity as well:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The original German preparation contained 1.5&nbsp;gm. of sodium bromid in
each hundred cubic centimeters, and this might be added to the foregoing
formula with advantage, so far as action is concerned. However, a sample of
“Pertussin” purchased in the open market in the United States failed to
respond to tests for bromids.</p>

<p>As fluidextract of thyme is not official, this formula is presented as furnishing
an acceptable preparation:</p>

might be expected to have similar but greater effect in chronic bronchitis.&mdash;(<i>Query

<h4>Quinin and Urea Hydrochlorid</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Could you tell me why quinin and urea hydrochlorid has not become more
popular for local anesthesia? Is it less efficacious or more toxic than other preparations? If
it is useful, can you name some trustworthy firm or brand? Please omit my name in
answering.</p>

<p class="sig">L.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;C., M.D., Mexico.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="468"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Quinin and urea hydrochlorid “has the actions of quinin. When
injected hypodermically it exerts an anesthetic action much more prolonged
than that of cocain” (Useful Drugs, Ed.&nbsp;4, 1920, p.&nbsp;127). It has been pointed
out editorially in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> (Feb. 14, 1920, p.&nbsp;462) that quinin has been
regarded for more than half a century by toxicologists as a protoplasmic
poison capable of destroying various forms of animal and vegetable cells, and
hence it need not be surprising that tissue necrosis may be produced by strong
solutions of the quinin salts. That this deleterious reaction actually does
occur and has militated against the general use of quinin and urea hydrochlorid
is confirmed by the report of the Committee on the Advantages and
Disadvantages of Local Anesthesia in Nose and Throat Work (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
July 31, 1920, p.&nbsp;315). To quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The only local anesthetic that produces edema and sloughing is quinin and urea hydrochlorid.
So many statements were found in the literature that this anesthetic has been
abandoned in other fields of medicine because of edema and sloughing, that writers who had
presented favorable reports in nose and throat operations were communicated with by your
committee. One writer who had recorded 390 cases of tonsillectomies extolling this anesthetic,
which he had used for four years and is still so recorded, now states that he has not used
it in two years, although no publication has been made retracting his former endorsement. Still
another writer, who stated that quinin-urea came nearest the ideal local anesthetic, now states
that he has ceased using it. Your committee finds that as far as nose and throat operations
are concerned, this drug has practically gone into “innocuous desuetude.”</p></div>

<p>The anesthesia produced by this drug at the time of operation is good and
the recovery of the patient might often be enhanced by its use if it did not
have the serious drawback. The product is official in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia,
and may be obtained from any reputable pharmaceutical house.&mdash;(<i>Query in The

<h4>Ricord Pills and House Organ Therapeutics</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;My mail is frequently cluttered with pseudo-scientific data
from various manufacturers of proprietary remedies which contain as much real
scientific information as the <i>Police Gazette</i>. I am enclosing a sample page of such
a periodical. The article has been so cleverly worded in the first paragraph, as to
impress the unthinking with the idea that sodium cacodylate is superior to arsphenamin,
when we know in reality that sodium cacodylate has been proved practically
worthless in syphilis (<i>vide</i> “Venarsen”). One case is reported, in which
twenty injections of sodium cacodylate were administered intravenously, from
October 23 to December 14. On December 18, a Wassermann test proved
negative, it had been strongly positive on October 20, but during the same
interval from October 23 to December 14, the patient had been taking by
mouth “Ricord pills” each containing half a grain of yellow iodid of mercury;
granted that he had taken these pills regularly, during all that time, it might
well be that the Wassermann would be sharply influenced by them. Again, a
negative Wassermann in the midst of treatment proves little; it might be
positive again in a few days. The article stimulates the further use of a
product of known worthlessness in the treatment of syphilis. How any one
can use sodium cacodylate in preference to arsphenamin in syphilis is beyond
me. If I mistake not, the Propaganda Department has not taken up the matter
of these various pamphlets of the drug companies, such as the <i>Doctor’s
Factotum</i>, <i>Therapeutic Notes</i>, etc., lauding to the skies such articles as “Seng,”
“Cactina Pillets,” etc., <i>ad nauseam</i>. The saddest part of the whole thing is that
it must bring returns from the unthinking, otherwise they would soon disappear,
which would be a great relief for the scrubwomen who empty our
waste baskets.</p>

<h4>Stannoxyl</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am very anxious to know whether tin or stannous oxid (SnO) has or
has had any place among useful drugs. I have seen such a prescription given in the treatment
of mucous colitis, and would be very glad to learn what its use may be.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Carlos Manuel Garcia, M.D.</span>, Havana, Cuba.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Recently, on the assumption that tin workers are less troubled
with boils than the average person, two French investigators proposed the use
of tin compounds in the treatment of staphylo­coccic infections. Based on
their work, a proprietary preparation&mdash;Stannoxyl&mdash;has been placed on the
market which is claimed to be “composed of stannous oxide and specially
purified metallic tin.” Absurd claims are made for the product: for instance,
“<span class="ell">..</span>. We have no hesitation in offering STANNOXYL&mdash;in Tablets or
Cachets&mdash;as the only true specific for diseases of Staphylo­coccus origin.” The
available evidence is unconvincing and in no way warrants such exaggerated
statements.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 6, 1920.</i>)</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I was much interested in your answer to a query about
Stannoxyl (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, March 6, p.&nbsp;629). I submit the following experience
as a confirmatory note:</p>

<p>While serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt, I for some
time had charge of the medical division of a hospital in which most of the
skin diseases occurring among soldiers in the district were treated. The
most common conditions were boils and septic sores, chiefly due to staphylo­coccal
infection, though several of the latter cases were diphtheritic. The
treatment adopted was that in ordinary use, namely, incision and evacuation of
pus, application of antiseptic dressings, and in most cases employment of the
specific vaccine. It was possible to judge of the efficacy of any variations of
treatment, as there were always plenty of cases undergoing the usual treatment
with which the results could be controlled.</p>

<p>An available supply of Stannoxyl, a proprietary remedy consisting of a
mixture of metallic tin and tin oxid, enabled me to give it a fair trial in full
doses in eight cases of boils of average severity, in which culture revealed the
infecting organism to be <i>Staphylo­coccus aureus</i>. The boils were treated locally
as usual, but no vaccine was given. No improvement could be demonstrated
in these cases that could not be shown in other cases similarly treated with
the omission of Stannoxyl; in fact, three of the treated cases were much longer
in clearing up than the untreated controls. Eight cases do not constitute a
very large series from which to draw conclusions; but if the preparation were
as good as the descriptive literature would lead one to believe, one should have
expected an evident result in at least one of these cases.</p>

<p>It has been stated that Stannoxyl does not inhibit the growth of staphylococci,
but only renders the growth less virulent. It is known that a certain
amount of tin may be absorbed from the intestine, and Salant, Rieger and
Treuhardt have shown that in certain cases tin may be retained for some time
in the skin; but it is questionable whether, when preparations of tin are given
by mouth, any reaches the staphylococci in the boils, or at any rate enough
materially to influence their growth or virulence.</p>

<p>In the cases treated by me, the results did not at all suggest that Stannoxyl
was a “specific for diseases of staphylo­coccal origin.”</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Isadore Dyer</span>, New Orleans, La.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;These are but some of the inquiries that have been received on
this subject and it is encouraging to note the scientifically critical attitude of
physicians toward new therapeutic agents. According to the French Medicinal
Company, Inc., which markets this product, “Syphilodol is a synthetic chemical
product of silver, arsenic and antimony<span class="ell">...</span>.” Nowhere in the advertising
matter is there any more definite statement as to the composition of this new
“synthetic” than that just quoted. The product is now under examination in
the Association’s laboratory and when this is completed a more detailed report
will doubtless be forthcoming. At present the work has progressed sufficiently
to show that Syphilodol tablets contain considerable quantities of mercury!
Although the advertising leaflets claim that the preparation is “the formula of
the late Dr. Alfred Fournier of Paris” and had been exhaustively tested by
Metchnikoff, who is alleged to have found it superior to salvarsan and neosalvarsan,
yet, strange to say, a careful search of French medical journals
fails to show any reports on Syphilodol. <i>Verb. sap.</i>&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Thialion is an heirloom of the days when lithium salts were
supported to be nature’s antidote for all kinds of ailments, supposedly due to
excess of uric acid. It was advertised as a uric acid eliminant and therefore
good for all kinds of diseases. The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
published a report on thialion in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Nov. 3, 1906. At that time
thialion was advertised by the Vass Chemical Company as a “laxative salt
of lithia” with the chemical formula “3Li<sub>2</sub>O.NaO.SO<sub>3</sub>.7HO,” and an elaborate
structural formula was also furnished. The Council reported that the product
was not a definite chemical compound, but a mixture consisting chiefly of
sodium sulphate, sodium citrate and small amounts of lithia. In recent advertisements,
thialion is referred to as “A Non-Effervescing Lithiated Laxative
Salt,” “a non-hygroscopic, non-deliquescent, granular salt of lithia,” etc., but
the chemical formula does not appear, nor is any definite statement of composition
furnished. According to this advertisement, the “indications” for
thialion are: “gout, rheumatism, uric acid diathesis, constipation, acute and
chronic, sluggish liver, Bright’s disease, albuminuria of pregnancy, asthma,
incontinence of urine, gravel, cystitis, chronic lead poisoning, headache,
neuralgia, neurasthenia and lumbago, Hay fever, etc.”&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal

<h4>“Spondylo­therapy,” “Electronic Reactions,” the “Oscilloclast,”
the “Electrobioscope,” Etc.</h4>


<p>For some time <i>The Journal</i> has received inquiries of which the following
recent examples are typical. This from an Ohio physician:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Please give me some information concerning Dr. Abrams and his diagnostic and therapeutic
devices known as reflexaphore and oscilloclast. If this is published please withhold
my name.”</p></div>

<p>A physician in Massachusetts writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Can you give me any information concerning Dr. (?) San Francisco, California, who
reports himself able to diagnose syphilis from a drop of blood sent him on a blotting
paper? He has caused a patient of mine a great deal of needless worry.”</p></div>

<p>And from Rhode Island a physician facetiously inquires:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am interested to know of the ‘Reactions of Abrams.’ Have you any information
that you can give me in regard to this matter? They apparently do wonderful things in
the West.”</p></div>

<p>While a New York physician acknowledges his failure to keep up with the
times thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To-day I had occasion to see a patient who mentioned having an Abrams test for
gonorrheal infection of the prostate. He also stated he wished to have Abrams’ treatment
for the same condition. Could you enlighten me as to what these are? I thought I had
kept myself up to date as to all new tests and treatments in my line; but evidently I
have been delinquent.”</p></div>

<p>According to our records, Albert Abrams, A.M., M.D., LL.D., F.R.M.S., was
born in San Francisco in 1864. He was graduated in medicine by the University
of Heidelberg, Germany, in 1882. Dr. Abrams is a member of his local
medical society and through that holds fellowship in the American Medical
Association. Dr. Abrams has written voluminously. In 1910, his book on
“Spondylo­therapy” (“Physio-Therapy of the Spine”) was reviewed in <i>The
Journal</i>. “Spondylotherapy” is a neologic creation of Dr. Abrams. According
to its disciples, it concerns itself “<i>only</i> with the excitation of the functional
centers of the spinal cord” and has been called “the science of evoking the
reflexes of the body both to diagnose and to cure disease.” In bringing its
review of Abrams’ book on “Spondylo­therapy” to a close, <i>The Journal</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. one wonders whether this is an attempt to explain osteopathy and chiropractic

devices of the author, or whether it is really true that medical men really know practically
nothing about the cure of disease through treatment of the spine. Let us hope that it
is the latter and that a careful study of this unique volume may open new avenues of
therapy heretofore undreamed of.”</p></div>

<p>While the review was obviously critical, yet in advertising the book, the
publisher picked out part of the closing sentence, omitted the context, and
quoted <i>The Journal</i> as having said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let us hope that a careful study of this unique volume may open new avenues of therapy
heretofore undreamed of.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="473"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></span></p>
<p>When this matter was brought to the attention of Dr. Abrams, he replied,
“I fail to see any real difference in the two quotations” and “only one  <span class="ell">..</span>.
with an astigmatic mentality” could “see any incongruity between the context
and the concluding sentence.” Yet, in this same letter which attempted to
justify the garbling of a quotation so as to make a critical review appear a
laudatory one, Dr. Abrams declared that the review in question was “conceived
and executed in a malicious spirit.”</p>

<p>Between 1912 and 1914 Dr. Abrams gave “clinical courses” on “Spondylo­therapy”
in various parts of the country&mdash;price $50. These “courses” were
widely advertised by an Ohio concern that seems to make a specialty not only
of handling the advertising campaigns of those members of the medical profession
who have unusual or bizarre methods to exploit, but also of acting as
an agent for the sale of such devices and publications as may be necessary to
the proper practice of the particular brand of therapy that is being exploited.
At the time this concern was featuring Abrams’ course it called attention to
the alleged fact that “no class were [<i>sic!</i>] so busy as those employing mechanical
treatment such as Osteopathy, Chiropractic, Mechanotherapy, etc.”</p>

<p>Says Dr. Abrams:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Despite the fury of tongue or the truculence of the pen, the osteopath and chiropractor
are inspiring the confidence of the community with their systems. Right or wrong in
their theory, they are, in vulgar parlance, ‘delivering the goods.’ Spondylo­therapy was a
product of necessity&mdash;the translation of an ignored field of medicine from a chaotic to a
scientific basis.”</p></div>

<p>Possibly the following testimonial published by Dr. Abrams as typical of
many received, and credited to “Dr. Henry Stacy Dodge, Richmond, Va.,” may
explain the field that “Spondylo­therapy” is to cover. Incidentally “Dr.” Dodge
is listed in the Richmond telephone directory as a chiropractor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been in practice for fifteen years in Chiropractic and ten years an Osteopath
and I wish to say that during the last three years I have received more genuine and sincere
satisfaction from the application of Spondylo­therapy than all other methods combined.
My success in gastrology alone is worth many times the cost of the information.”</p></div>

<p>More recently, Dr. Abrams has advertised that he gives a “course” in
Spondylo­therapy in San Francisco, beginning on the first of each month. The
course last four weeks. “The honorarium for this course is $200.00.”</p>

<p>In 1912 an organization was created devoted to this new therapeutic method:
the “American Association for the Study of Spondylo­therapy.” Later Dr.
Abrams was made Honorary President. Whether the organization is still
viable we do not know.</p>


<h5>ELECTRONIC REACTIONS OF ABRAMS</h5>

<p>In addition to “Spondylo­therapy,” Dr. Abrams has also evolved what he
calls the “Electronic Reactions of Abrams.” These are said to make possible
long-distance diagnoses, it being necessary only to send a few drops of blood
taken from the patient and allowed to dry on a slide. There are, it seems,
certain instruments and devices used in the performance of these diagnostic
feats. By means of the “Electronic Reactions” Dr. Abrams (while admitting
the protective factor of vaccination against smallpox) has discovered that
practically all the vaccines obtained from reliable firms yield the reaction
(“electronic tests”) of congenital syphilis, and that many of them also yield
the reaction of tuberculosis and of streptococci and staphylococci. Further,
“from the cicatrices of all vaccinated persons, one can always elicit a reaction of
congenital syphilis and in early scars a tuberculous reaction.” Dr. Abrams
also declares that exposing vaccine virus for ten minutes to blue light will
destroy the syphilitic, strepto­coccic and staphylococci reactions and exposing
it for the same period to yellow light will destroy the tuberculous reaction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="474"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a></span></p>
<p>One of Dr. Abrams’ disciples&mdash;Sir James Barr&mdash;frequently quoted with
evident satisfaction, declares that from a fresh sample of blood spread over
four square inches of white blotting paper, “Dr. Abrams can diagnose the sex,
race and disease of the patient.” However, there are certain precautions that
must be taken: The patient should face West, “the blood should be taken in
a subdued light and there should be no strong red or yellow coloring material
in the room.”</p>

<p>In various places Dr. Abrams has asseverated that “if splancho-diagnosis is
approached with a prejudiced mind, it is better not to attempt it, for there are
‘none so blind as those that will not see.’&#8239;”</p>

<p>Dr. Abrams founded and edits <i>Physico-Clinical Medicine</i>. It is published by
“Physico-Clinical Co.” at 2135 Sacramento St., San Francisco&mdash;the address,
according to the telephone directory, of Dr. Abrams’ residence. It is a quarterly
“Devoted to the Study of the Electronic Reactions of Abrams and the Visceral
reflexes of Abrams, in the Diagnosis, Treatment and Pathology of Disease.”
Single copies, one dollar; by the year, two dollars. The publication is, apparently,
not entered as second class matter, in fact, presumably, it could not be,
as it seems obviously to be an advertising affair. Each issue contains material
dealing with “Spondylo­therapy,” “Splanchno-Diagnosis,” “Electronic Reactions”
and other discoveries and theories of Dr. Abrams. In it also is published a list
of “Some recent visitors at Dr. Abrams’ laboratory,” the names and addresses
of the “Lessees of Oscilloclast” (about which more later), testimonials for Dr.
Abrams, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, it carries advertisements of Dr. Abrams’ “Physico-Clinical Laboratory”
(also at 2135 Sacramento St.) and his “Practical Courses in Spondylo­therapy
and Electronic Diagnosis and Treatment” ($200 in advance). Some of
the devices of Dr. Abrams are also advertised. “No apparatus sold on credit.
Terms cash.” Among these are:</p>

<h5>THE OSCILLOCLAST</h5>

<p>But what seems to be the outstanding piece of apparatus, devised or invented
by Dr. Abrams, the pièce de resistance, as it were, of physicoclinical diagnosis
and treatment, is the “Oscilloclast.”</p>

<p>This device is not for sale. It can be had only on lease. The first payment
is $200 or $250, according to whether it is wired for alternating or direct current.
Then there is a monthly payment of $5. Dr. Abrams publishes a list of
more than 130 men who have leased one or more “Oscilloclasts.” Sir James
Barr’s name heads the list. According to Dr. Abrams, the “Oscilloclast” owes
its conception to the therapeutic principles he advocates. These, in part, are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. Physiologic phenomena are manifestations of electronic energy.</p>

<p>“2. Pathologic phenomena are manifestations of perturbed electronic energy.</p>

<p>“3. The energy in health and disease has an invariable and definite rate of vibration
(determinable by the electronic reactions).</p>

<p>“4. Specific drugs possess a like vibratory rate as the diseases for which they are
effective.</p>

<p>“These like vibratory rates (hemovibrations) of drugs owe their efficiency to their
inherent radioactivity. Thus, an obsolete drug like gamboge painted on the chest in
incipient tuberculosis will effect a symptomatic cure within a few weeks. Gamboge possesses
the same vibratory rate as tuberculosis. Our conception that drug action is dependent
on direct cellular contact is thus demolished&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.</p>

<p>“5. All forms of energy whether derived from heat, electricity or magnetism may be
made to yield different rates of vibration and these rates corresponding to the diseases are
utilized for their destruction.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="475"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a></span></p>
<p>If one accepts one of Dr. Abrams’ theories, the possibilities of such a piece
of machinery as the “Oscilloclast” would seem to loom large, not only in therapeutics,
but also in economics. All one needs to do, according to Dr. Abrams,
is to ascertain “the vibration rate of a drug” and then to substitute the same
vibration as produced by the “Oscilloclast.” Thus, if one substitutes the
“vibratory rate of atropin” for the drug itself “the mouth dries or the subject
feels as if it were puckered.” Conversely, if you switch the “Oscilloclast” to
the pilocarpin vibratory rate, there is a copious flow of saliva.</p>


<h5>THERAPEUTIC RESULTS WITH OSCILLOCLAST</h5>

<p>What some of the lessees of the oscilloclast are accomplishing (if we are
to believe the clinical reports published in <i>Physico-Clinical Medicine</i>) may be
gathered from the following quotations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Woman, Age 52.&mdash;Diagnosis of acquired syphilis made by one of our most eminent
clinicians. (?) Abrams test showed tuberculosis of the apex of the right lung. No syphilis.
Fourteen treatments with the Oscilloclast at 5. Patient gained fourteen pounds in three
weeks. Now in perfect health.”</p>

<p>“Mechanic, Age 22.&mdash;Acute acquired syphilis. General eruption, throat, mouth symptoms
and chancre. Thirteen treatments with the Oscilloclast at 3, and splenic sterilization
only. Complete abatement of all symptoms.”</p>

<p>“Woman, Age 42.&mdash;Strep infection of the second upper cuspid tooth of three years’
standing. Well developed sinus. Regular discharge of pus. Eight treatments with the
Oscilloclast at 2. Clinically cured.”</p>

<p>“Cancer of the pylorus and pylorectomy executed at the Mayo Clinic. Later, vomiting,
severe pains, loss in weight, etc. After the third treatment [with “Oscilloclast”] pains
ceased and, after 14 treatments, she was well and continued so when I last saw her.”</p>

<p>“Cancer of uterus. Inoperable. Severe uterine hemorrhages. Electrode of Oscilloclast
to cervix and hemorrhage ceased after second treatment. After 14 treatments the patient
declared she was well. Another case of the same character was followed by equally good
results.”</p></div>


<h5>ECONOMIC RESULTS WITH OSCILLOCLAST</h5>

<p>It also seems to be a great business-getter, as the following testimonials
published by Dr. Abrams show:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Oscilloclast has doubled my business.”&mdash;S. King, M.D. (Pa.).</p>

<p>“I am doing good work with the Oscilloclast in T.&nbsp;B. and when I get more room I
shall want another machine.”&mdash;H. Michener (Kas.).</p>

<p>“We are swamped with work and our three cord Oscilloclast is working to full capacity.
We are still astonishing the incredulous and keeping busy. We must have another Oscilloclast
at once for there are so many here who demand treatment.”&mdash;W.&nbsp;P. Myers, M.D.
(Cal.).</p></div>


<h5>THE ELECTROBIOSCOPE</h5>

<p>More recently, Dr. Abrams has extended his observations and experiments,
using what apparently is a modification of the old fashioned pith ball suspended
by a silk thread from a rubber rod with which we all experimented during our
high school days. This device Dr. Abrams has called the “Electrobioscope.” It is
for sale by the Physico-Clinical Co. The “Electrobioscope,” in addition to
doing many other things, has demonstrated (to Dr. Abrams) the “sexuality of
numbers and sounds.” Thus, if the pith ball is charged negatively and the
numbers 1 to 9 are marked on a narrow board and the vowels and consonants
are marked on another board, it will be found&mdash;still according to Dr. Abrams&mdash;that
even numbers repel the pith ball while odd numbers attract it. Vowels
repel and consonants attract. “A female hair repels and a male hair attracts.”
From these data Dr. Abrams deduces that “even numbers and vowels are female
and odd numbers and consonants are male.”</p>

<p>The value of music as a therapeutic agent is briefly touched on by Dr.
Abrams and we are told that the overture of “Tannhäuser” will increase the
pulse rate whereas “Meditation” diminishes blood pressure and pulse rate. “In
dogs, music augments elimination of carbonic acid and increases the consumption
<span class="pagenum" title="476"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a></span>of oxygen.” Love, says Dr. Abrams, “is dependent upon matter in
vibration and the passional component has a wave metric index of 14 in both
sexes.” In referring to legendary lore, Dr. Abrams apparently assigns a
scientific basis for the belief among the bucolic that carrying around a potato
has therapeutic virtue. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A cut potato (carried on the person) prevents elicitation of the stomach reflex when the
negative pole of a bar-magnet is presented to the stomach region whereas the positive pole
will evoke dulness.”</p></div>

<p>It seems also that the “rheumatic rings” of iron “when worn yield a neutral
energy which prevents the elicitation of the stomach reflex by either pole of
a bar-magnet.” We learn, too, that the divining rod “no longer belongs to
occultism but is entitled to consideration as a scientific fact.”</p>

<p>Dr. Abrams also has investigated methods whereby the sex of the fetus may
be diagnosed. In the human these investigations have, apparently, been so
limited as to permit only tentative conclusions. In the case of eggs of the
domestic fowl, Dr. Abrams reports that with four eggs that yielded negative
polarity, the result of incubation was four hens. Of five eggs yielding a positive
polarity only two hatched, one was a hen and one a rooster, giving an
“error in observation.” Three eggs tested yielded neutral polarity and “as
predicted the eggs were sterile.” In case of an egg yielding a negative (female)
polarity “an attempt was made to reverse the sex by painting one end of the
egg with a yellow coloring material.” The result was a rooster.</p>

<p>Much more might be written about what one of our correspondents calls
the wonderful things they are doing in the West, but space forbids. “Neither
the fury of tongue,” says Dr. Abrams in the preface to his book, New Concepts
in Diagnosis and Treatment, “nor the truculence of pen can discredit the
author’s observations which are capable of analyzation and demonstration.” If
there is any scientific foundation for the marvels that Dr. Abrams so picturesquely
features, the scientific world has not yet found it out!&mdash;(<i>From The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 25, 1922.</i>)</p>


<h4>Dr. Abrams’ Graduation</h4>

<p>In this department of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> for March 25 appeared an article on Dr.
Albert Abrams and some of his discoveries. We have now received a letter
from a physician, who asks that his name be not published, reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I notice in your article on Albert Abrams the statement that he was
born in 1864 and received his degree of M.D. in Heidelberg 1882; if these data are
furnished by himself and not a typographical error&mdash;though I find the same data in the
American Medical Directory for 1916&mdash;then it is high time that some board of censors
should make a careful examination of his credentials.</p>

<p>“Anybody, like myself, who is acquainted with medical matters in Germany knows
that it is preposterous to assume that anybody could obtain the degree of M.D. in any
German university at the age of 18 years.</p>

<p class="sig">M. D., <span class="smcap">Leipzig</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Eighteen <i>is</i> rather young to receive an M.D. degree from Heidelberg! By
again going over the various sources of information available the following
data were collected: In Polk’s Medical Directory for 1886 Dr. Abrams’ name
appears as a graduate of the University of Heidelberg, 1882, and of Cooper
Medical College in 1883. The records we have from these two institutions confirm
these dates. The year of Dr. Abrams’ birth seems less clear. In the early
part of 1902 the American Medical Association sent Dr. Abrams a blank for
him to fill out for a permanent record. This was returned in due course and,
according to it, Dr. Abrams was born in San Francisco Dec. 8, 1863. This
same date appears in various editions of “Who’s Who in America.” A blank
sent by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Directory Department to Dr. Abrams in 1908 asking for a
personal biographical report was returned Aug. 20, 1908; it gave Dr. Abrams’
<span class="pagenum" title="477"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a></span>date of birth as Dec. 8, 1864. A similar blank sent in the earlier part of 1909 was
returned giving the same birth date. We learn, however, that an affidavit
executed in 1917 states that Albert Abrams was born in San Francisco Dec. 8,
1862.</p>

<p>Just how long Dr. Abrams attended Heidelberg University before he was
granted the M.D. degree, we do not know. Apparently, at that time the standards
for admission to that institution were not especially severe and the length
of time one would have to attend before being admitted to an examination
seems to have depended on the educational credentials that the matriculant
offered. What credentials Dr. Abrams submitted, we do not know. Assuming
that the earliest date (1862) represents Dr. Abrams’ date of birth, he could
have been but twenty years old when he received his M.D. from Heidelberg.
This indicates a precocity that might have forecast Dr. Abrams’ later
achievements.</p>

<p>Throughout the records of Dr. Abrams’ educational credentials there appears
the statement that he also graduated from the “University of Portland” in
1892, receiving the degree of A.M. From references available we have been
unable to find any record of a “University of Portland.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 8, 1922.</i>)</p>


<h4>A Defense by Upton Sinclair</h4>

<p>A somewhat voluminous letter has been received from Mr. Upton Sinclair,
which is a defense of Dr. Albert Abrams of San Francisco. We publish Mr.
Sinclair’s letter because we believe it is written in honesty and sincerity&mdash;and
because <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> readers will enjoy it! It is worth mentioning in this
connection that Mr. Sinclair in his latest book devotes a few pages to a eulogy
of Dr. Abrams and his methods. This material has not only been reproduced
by Dr. Abrams in his “house organ” <i>Physico-Clinical Medicine</i> but is reprinted
in leaflet form and is being distributed by some of the individuals who are
exploiting the Abrams methods. Such reprints have been sent to this office by
both laymen and physicians.</p>


<h5>MR. SINCLAIR’’S LETTER</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>To the Editor.</i>&mdash;A few weeks ago you published an article dealing with the
discoveries or claims of Dr. Albert Abrams of San Francisco. I happen to be
attending Dr. Abrams’ clinic at the time and have discussed this article with
him at some length. Dr. Abrams follows the policy of ignoring attacks on his
work, taking the view that in the long run, the man who cures disease makes his
way in the world in spite of all opposition. However, it is easy to see that he
has been deeply hurt by this attack on his reputation, and as one of his friends
and most ardent admirers I am taking the liberty of addressing a letter to you.</p>

<p>I do not know if the rules of your publication permit intervention in medical
affairs by a mere layman. Permit me to introduce myself as a layman who
for some twenty years tried faithfully to be cured of various diseases by many
doctors of the best reputation in many parts of the world, and failed; and who,
therefore, was compelled, as a matter of self-protection, to look into the question
of health for himself. I have read so many different kinds of books on
health and made so many experiments of my own that nowadays when I meet
with a group of physicians I find that before long they come to accept me as
one of themselves. You may not go that far, but at least you may be so
generous as to allow me to tell you a little of what I have seen during the
time I have spent in the clinic of Dr. Albert Abrams.</p>

<p>I observe that in the course of your two page article dealing with this subject,
you nowhere have anything to charge against Dr. Abrams, nor do you
show that you have investigated his work. You consider that all you have to
do is to quote Dr. Abrams’ own words as to what he can do, and that <i>these
words refute themselves</i>. [Italics our.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]. Also you quote Dr. Abrams’
schedules of prices, and imply that his motives are mercenary. I will take up
these two questions one at a time.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="478"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a></span></p>

<h5>WHAT DR. ABRAMS CAN DO</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>First, as to what Dr. Abrams can do: I have been here and have seen
him do all that he claims to do. Therefore, you will understand that this portion
of your argument does not produce much impression on me. I merely say
to you, why do you not come and see, or why do you not send some reliable
representative to see&mdash;before you take it for granted that Abrams is a knave
or a lunatic? This man is not merely a colleague of yours; he is a fellow of
the Royal Medical Society of Great Britain [We know of no such society.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]
and surely he was entitled to a little elementary courtesy from you. Why did
you not at least write to him and permit him to put before you a little of his
evidence on the genuineness of his work? You admit that he is a graduate of
the Universities of Heidelberg and Stanford; [Dr. Abrams is not a graduate
of “Stanford.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] you admit that he was graduated from Heidelberg at the
age of twenty. It happens that this was the youngest and remains the youngest
age at which any man has taken a Doctor’s Degree at that University in a
hundred years. If you had inquired further you might have learned that ten
years ago Abrams was one of the most respected physicians in San Francisco.
What has he done since to forfeit the honors of a lifetime? All that he has
done is to shut himself up in his laboratory and make the most revolutionary
discoveries of this or any other age; and now when he emerges and offers this
work to the world, you can think of nothing to do but jeer at him.</p>

<p>I spent two weeks in his clinic; then I took six months to write to his physicians
all over the country, <i>and to experiment with his cures on a great number
of my friends</i>. [Italics again ours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] Now I am spending another two
weeks in his clinic, and I venture to stake whatever reputation I have, or hope
to have in this world, upon the statement that Albert Abrams has discovered
the great secret of the <i>diagnosis and cure of all the major disease</i>. [Again we
must italicize.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] He has proven by diagnosing with the taps of his own
sensitive finger tips over 15,000 people, and my investigation convinces me that
he has cured over 95 per cent. of these who have taken his treatments. Moreover,
he has taught his method to 200 or 300 other physicians, and some 80 per
cent. of these have submitted to me answers to a questionnaire in which they
claim thousands of cures.</p>

<p>You may say, perhaps, that I am not competent to judge of cures. For the
sake of argument, I will grant that; but I assert that I am competent to
judge of physicians, for I have tested several score of them, and if I ever knew a
devoted scientist and a great humanitarian, it is Albert Abrams. In his clinic
I have met perhaps a hundred physicians, and I venture to assert that a number
of these are men both of integrity and capacity, and when I asked them why
they came, I got invariably one answer: “Because I sent him blood specimens
and I found that invariably he sent me a correct diagnosis.” Not once, but
at least two score times, I have seen Albert Abrams take a blood specimen
brought to him, without even the name of the patient, and heard him diagnose
cancer or sarcoma, and from the blood specimen locate the growth <span class="lowercase smcap">PRECISELY TO
AN INCH</span>. [Italics fail one here!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] Then I have seen the patient, an entire
stranger to Abrams, brought into the clinic and examined, not merely by
Abrams, but by a score of other physicians, and the growth found precisely
at the spot indicated. (This was done twice between the time when this letter
was dictated and the time when it was transcribed.) Three times, yesterday, I
saw a diagnosis made of syphilis and the patient brought in, and all the standard
reactions demonstrated. I have seen, not once, but hundreds of times,
tubercular lesions diagnosed and located from the blood specimen and the
patient brought in and the condition demonstrated by percussion. All these
things are going on day after day. They are being done in other clinics in
several score of cities, and you may have the addresses for the asking. Why
do you not ask? [We have some such addresses in the Propaganda files.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></div>


<h5>THE ECONOMIC ELEMENT</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I take up the second criticism, that Albert Abrams is mercenary. He charges
$200.00 for the clinical course, which may last as long as the physician wishes.
It seems to me that that price is to be judged somewhat in relation to what he
<span class="pagenum" title="479"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a></span>has to teach. He maintains a large establishment; he has need of many
assistants, and expensive apparatus for his research work. He charges for the
use of his oscilloclast a deposit of $250.00, and a rental of $5.00 per month. The
former item covers the cost of manufacturing the machine, and the second item
must be compared with the fact that a great number of physicians who are
using this instruments are today <i>enjoying incomes of from $1,000.00 to $2,000.00
per week</i>. [Once more, italics!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I visited a physician who told me he had treated thirty-two
patients that day with his one instrument, and that his income was over $1,300.00
for that week, and I could name several who have given similar accounts. It
may be, of course, that you will say they should not charge so much. The
average charge is about $200.00 for a <i>guaranteed cure of such diseases as syphilis,
tuberculosis, cancer and sarcoma</i>. [Italics our again.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]. Do you know anyone
who will guarantee to cure a cancer or sarcoma at any price? [No!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>I am sure you will agree with me that it would be possible to find physicians
who would be willing to put up many hundreds of dollars to guarantee that
neither cancer nor sarcoma can at the present time be cured except by operation.
And I can recall many cases in my lifetime when I paid hundreds and
even thousands of dollars to be cured of diseases by the medical profession, and
I am unable to recall a single case where I was ever cured of anything. [Still
this need not be an indictment of scientific medicine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>Finally, as regards to the subject of mercenary motives, permit me to state
that I have in my possession a letter from Dr. Abrams stating that what he
desires is to have established an institute for the purpose of making his work
known to the world, and that if such an institute is established he is prepared
to give up all his other work and devote all his time, without compensation, to
the institute. Furthermore, he is willing to furnish his instruments without
charge to any medical institution which requests them. Within the last few
days, on account of the enormous number of blood specimens brought into his
clinic, Dr. Abrams has signed in my presence, and is prepared to issue a statement
to the effect that his charge for examining blood specimens is to be
raised from $10.00 to $25.00 and all checks are to be made payable to a Trust
Fund which is to be immediately established, for the purpose of founding the
institution above referred to. I do not see how the medical profession can
ask for more than this; but if you do, I should be pleased to receive your suggestions
and transmit them to my friend.</p></div>


<h5>AN OLD STORY</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Now, this failure to recognize a great medical discovery is an old story. It
was the experience of Harvey [We knew poor Harvey would be dragged into
this.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>], of Jenner and of Lister. But the world moves on, and men’s brains
should improve, and it should be possible to shorten the time of persecution
which the great pioneers of science have to suffer. I put to you this simple
proposition: Send a reliable man of science to the clinic of Albert Abrams,
and let him stay there as long as he pleases and see all that he wishes to see, and
then send you a report, and if it indicates that you have blundered in your condemnation,
be honest and say so, and save your profession from another black
mark against its name.</p>

<h4>Comment</h4>

<p>A testimonial is of value to the extent that the person giving it is an authority
on the subject on which he testifies. When Mr. Sinclair testifies on socialism
we may listen respectfully, believing him competent to express an opinion; but
when Mr. Sinclair gives a testimonial on certain bizarre methods of interpreting
difficult and obscure problems in medicine, he leaves us cold.</p>

<p>Mr. Sinclair says that he has spent time in Dr. Abrams’ clinic and is
wonderfully impressed with Dr. Abrams’ achievements. So is the small boy
impressed with the marvelous facility with which the magician extracts the
<span class="pagenum" title="480"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a></span>white rabbit from the silk hat. Mr. Sinclair is convinced “that Albert Abrams
has discovered the great secret of the diagnosis and cure of all the major
diseases.” The small boy is equally convinced that the prestidigitator has
solved the mystery of producing snow white bunnies from airy nothings.</p>

<p>Great store seems to be placed by Mr. Sinclair on the favorable reports
that he obtained from those who are relieving the public&mdash;of from $1,000 to
$2,000 a week&mdash;by the Abrams methods of diagnosis and treatment. What kind
of evidence did he expect to get from such obviously <i>ex parte</i> sources? Mr.
Sinclair’s naïveté may be childlike, but it is not scientific. While the significance
of the statement may not be apparent to Mr. Sinclair, it is a fact that when the
names of the one hundred or more lessees of the Abrams “Oscilloclast” were
checked up it was found that a number of these individuals were already in
the Propaganda files in some other connection. That these disciples of Abrams,
who are “enjoying incomes of from $1,000 to $2,000 a week,” should speak
favorably of the Abrams method was inevitable!</p>

<p>Some years ago Upton Sinclair wrote a book on his (at that time) panacea
for human ailments. It was the “Fasting Cure.” At that time he told of
individual acquaintances suffering from various ailments: one was “dying of
kidney trouble”; another was “in the hospital from nervous breakdown”; still
another had “only a year to live,” while a fourth was “a nervous wreck, craving
for death.” Of these Mr. Sinclair said at the time: “And there is not one of
these people whom I could not cure if I had him alone for a couple of weeks.”</p>


<h5>MR. SINCLAIR AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION</h5>

<p>At that time Mr. Sinclair was greatly perturbed at the attitude of the
medical profession toward his dictum that “the fast is Nature’s remedy for all
diseases.” There was just one physician “who was really interested.” This
man lived “in an out of the way town in Arkansas” and asked Sinclair to “let
him print several thousand copies of the article in the form of a pamphlet to
be distributed among his patients.” As Mr. Sinclair said at the time, “one single
mind among all the 140,000 [physicians], open to a new truth!” And this
“open mind,” that of a man who was practicing in a small town in Arkansas
and needed “several thousand copies” of the Sinclair article to distribute
to his patients!</p>

<p>After his “fasting cure” experience, Mr. Sinclair had the “raw food” fad&mdash;also
abandoned in due time. In one of his recent books (“The Brass Check”)
he refers to his outgrown fads in the following words: “I <span class="ell">..</span>. was willing
to try anything in the hope of solving the health problem, which I have since
realized is insolvable&mdash;there being no diet or system of any sort which will permit
a man to overwork with impunity.” He states further in this same
connection:</p>

<p>“I look back in retrospect and have not a little fun over my ‘monkey diet’
days.”</p>

<p>Who shall say that ten years hence Mr. Sinclair may not be able to look
back, good humoredly, in retrospect, to another time when he was “monkeying”
with a subject that was beyond his ken?&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April

<h3>ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, NOT ASPIRIN</h3>


<p>The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry publishes a report in this issue
giving its reasons for deleting “Aspirin-Bayer” from New and Non­official
Remedies. In order that a standard may be provided, the drug acetyl­salicylic
is <span class="nowrap">retained<a name="FNanchor_259_275" id="FNanchor_259_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_275" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> in N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;R. under its scientific name, acetyl­salicylic acid, aspirin
<span class="pagenum" title="481"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a></span>appearing as a synonym. The attempt on the part of the Bayer Company to
perpetuate the monopoly it has had for seventeen years in the United States
was briefly discussed editorially in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 12, 1916. We quoted
from <i>Printers’ Ink</i>, a magazine devoted to advertising, in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The manufacturers of aspirin are about to launch an extensive advertising campaign to
clinch the market as far as possible before the expiration of their patent rights next year<span class="ell">...</span>.
The purpose of the campaign is to identify the product with the trademark of the
Bayer Company and to this extent hamper competition after the expiration of the patent.”</p></div>

<p>It is worth while reminding physicians of the privileges the Bayer Company
has enjoyed for so many years, owing largely to our inequitable and crude
patent laws, or to their construction. First, it should be remembered that
practically no other country in the world, not even the original home of the
preparation, would grant a patent on either acetyl­salicylic acid, the product,
or on the process for making that product. The United States granted both!
As a result, for seventeen years it has been impossible in this country for anybody
except the Bayer Company to manufacture or sell acetyl­salicylic acid,
either under its chemical name or under any other name. Neither was it
possible for individuals, hospitals or any other institutions to import it, legally,
for their own use.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the American people have been made to pay exorbitantly
for the monopoly our patent office granted this firm. Three or four years ago
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, through the American consuls, obtained information regarding
the price at which acetyl­salicylic acid was sold in foreign countries. At that
time, acetyl­salicylic acid, as “aspirin,” was costing American druggists&mdash;and
of course the American public had to pay still more for it&mdash;43 cents an ounce.
Just across the border in Canada it sold for one-third the price asked here. In
some of the foreign countries, acetyl­salicylic acid under its scientific name
could be purchased by the druggists of those countries at from one-sixth to
less than one-tenth the price that it cost American druggists. Here are some
of the figures:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="lh11em" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Austria-Hungary</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td><td class="tal pl3"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Holland</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">British Isles</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;6 cents an ounce</td><td class="tal pl3"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Norway</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Denmark</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td><td class="tal pl3"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Sweden</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">France</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td><td class="tal pl3"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">United States</span></div></td><td class="tar">43 cents an ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal"><div class="dots7"><span class="item">Germany</span></div></td><td class="tar">&#8199;4 cents an ounce</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Not content with the iron-bound monopoly which it had been granted
through our patent laws, the company attempted further to clinch its exclusive
rights by giving the preparation a fancy name, “aspirin,” and getting a trademark
on this name. The patent on acetyl­salicylic acid expires next month
(February, 1917). After its expiration the product, and its method of manufacture,
become common property. American manufacturers will now be able
to do what manufacturers in other countries, other than the patentees, have
long been doing&mdash;make and sell acetyl­salicylic acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_260_276" id="FNanchor_260_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_276" class="fnanchor">260</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is extremely improbable that any American manufacturer
will market acetyl­salicylic acid under the name aspirin, although we believe
they would have a legal right to do so. The courts have held in related
instances that when a patented article has been known during the life of the
patent under a trademarked name, with the expiration of the patent the name
<span class="pagenum" title="482"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a></span>as well as the product becomes common property. The classical “Singer
Sewing Machine” decision and the lanolin case are in point. The Bayer
Company, through a widespread newspaper advertising campaign, seems to be
attempting to perpetuate its seventeen-year monopoly by leading the public
to believe that there can be only one brand of genuine acetyl­salicylic acid on
the market&mdash;that made by the Bayer Company.</p>

<p>The firm will, of course, continue to manufacture and advertise the product
under the name “Aspirin-Bayer,” and will probably charge high prices for it,
as was the case with phenacetin (acetphenetidin). In any event, physicians
hereafter should do what for a long time we have been advising should be
done, namely, prescribe the compound under its scientific name, acetyl­salicylic
acid. They should do this if for no other reason than that they would be using
the name which carries with it a reminder of the composition of the preparation.
Of course, for those who have been writing “aspirin” it will be rather
difficult to write “acetyl­salicylic acid,” just as a quarter of a century ago it was
difficult for the physician of that day who had been using the copyright name
“antifebrin” to write “acet-anilid,” a name which nowadays is easy, even for
laymen.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 20, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>“What’s in a Name?”</h4>

<p>Under the caption “What’s in a Name?” the current (April) issue of the
<i>Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry</i> has an editorial dealing with
the nomen­clatures&mdash;common and proprietary&mdash;of acetyl­salicylic acid. The
editorial was prompted by an article by Dr. Leech printed in the same issue.
Replying to its own question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The answer to this question so far as it applies to acetyl­salicylic acid (popularly known
as aspirin) is the difference between eighty-eight cents, the price the druggist must pay for
every one hundred tablets of Bayer aspirin, and forty cents, the cost of an equally pure
American product. Naturally, this difference in cost is passed on to the individual consumer.</p>

<p>“That no scientific justification exists for this difference in cost is clearly shown in the
contribution by Dr. Paul Nicholas Leech, of the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical
Association, page 288 of this issue.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the excess profit fully warrants the extensive and shrewdly-worded
advertising campaign now in progress, a campaign which must eventually fail, because in the
first place, it is contrary to the prevailing spirit of modern advertising, the motive of which
is constructive rather than destructive, and, in the second place, it appeals merely to the temporary
ignorance of the public at large, and has no basis in fact.</p>

<p>“We have been informed that the Custodian of Alien Enemy Property has taken charge
of the stock interests of alien enemies in the company conducting this propaganda. Surely the
Custodian will not care, even in a trustee capacity, to continue as a participant in a misleading
campaign whose sole purpose is the perpetuation of a monopoly hitherto enjoyed under full
patent protection.”</p></div>

<p>The article to which the editorial refers is a somewhat technical one giving
the findings of an examination made, at the request of the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry, in the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association
by Paul Nicholas Leech, Ph.D., of various American brands of acetyl­salicylic
acid (aspirin). The result of the investigation may be summed up
briefly in the statement that there are on the American market, made by
American firms, several brands of acetyl­salicylic acid that are just as good as,
if not better than, the Bayer product.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has called attention to the misleading propaganda on the part
of the Bayer Company (Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co.), in its
attempt to perpetuate the monopoly granted under our inequitable patent laws.
This is done by conveying the inference that the only pure acetyl­salicylic acid
on the market is that known as “Aspirin-Bayer.” Physicians should again be
reminded of the facts in the case of aspirin: Practically no other country in
the world, and certainly not Germany, the original home of aspirin, would
<span class="pagenum" title="483"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a></span>grant a patent either on acetyl­salicylic acid, itself, or the process for making
it. The United States granted both! As a result no one in this country except
the Bayer Company could for seventeen years manufacture or sell acetyl­salicylic
acid either under its chemical name or under any other name. Nor
was it permissible for hospitals or individuals to import it. While the
monopoly held, the American people were compelled to pay from six to ten
times as much for acetyl­salicylic acid as were the people of Great Britain,
France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Holland, Norway or Sweden.
At a time when American druggists were compelled to pay 43 cents an ounce
for acetyl­salicylic acid as aspirin, just across the border in Canada it sold for
about one-third the price.</p>

<p>About a year ago, the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry announced that
“Aspirin-Bayer” had been deleted from New and Non­official Remedies while
the scientific term acetyl­salicylic acid was retained along with standards to
insure its quality. The necessity for a standard becomes evident when it is
remembered that acetyl­salicylic acid is not yet an official drug, and its
purity, therefore, is not subject to the control of the federal Food and Drugs
Act. It is worth while at this time to remind physicians that several brands
of acetyl­salicylic acid (aspirin) have been found to comply with the standards
set by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and have been admitted to
New and Non­official Remedies<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_261_277" id="FNanchor_261_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_277" class="fnanchor">261</a></span> These, of course, are thereby subject to
the control of the federal law to conform to the standard to which they profess.
</p>

<p>Leech’s report gives still greater weight to the suggestion that has been
made for some time, viz., that physicians should describe acetyl­salicylic acid
under its scientific name rather than its proprietary name, even though, in
the opinion of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, the proprietary name, aspirin, has become common
property since the expiration of the acetyl­salicylic acid patent. Every
consideration of public interest, of patriotism and of ordinary common sense
should prompt physicians to specify acetyl­salicylic acid in writing prescriptions.&mdash;(<i>Editorial
from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 13, 1918.</i>)</p>


<h4>Advertising Principles&mdash;Lay and Medical</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has received two letters, one from a physician who had written
to the New York <i>Tribune</i> protesting against an advertisement of “Aspirin
(Bayer)” that appeared in the rotogravure supplement of a Sunday edition and
the other the New York <i>Tribune’s</i> answer to the protest. The two letters make
an editorial in themselves. Here is the letter of the physician&mdash;Dr. Edwin H.
Shepard of Syracuse, N.&nbsp;Y.&mdash;which was addressed to the editor of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a great daily newspaper takes a stand for honest advertising it seems worthy that
acknowledgement should be made. On April 14 the illustrated Sunday supplement of the
New York <i>Tribune</i>, together with many of the other papers of the country, published a
duplicate of the enclosed advertisement of ‘Aspirin.’ Your own instructive editorial on
‘Acetylsalicylic Acid, or What’s in a Name?’ had appeared in the copy of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>
of the day preceding.</p>

<p>“Believing in the sincerity of the <i>Tribune</i> in its effort for honest advertising, I sent them
a copy of your editorial together with the page of advertisement, also calling attention to
the statements in the advertisement which seemed questionable. Among the questionable
matters in the advertisement were the statements, ‘The one genuine Aspirin,’ ‘No other is
genuine,’ ‘That which is genuine possesses qualities of excellence never found in imitations,’
<span class="pagenum" title="484"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a></span>‘For your protection <span class="ell">..</span>. every package and tablet is marked with the Bayer cross,’
‘Your guarantee of purity,’ and ‘Refuse substitutes as they may prove ineffective and
harmful.’</p>

<p>“The Tribune was requested to investigate into the standing of the Bayer company and its
product. A few days later the enclosed letter was received from the paper’s Bureau of
Investigations.”</p></div>

<p>And here is the New York <i>Tribune’s</i> answer, signed by R.&nbsp;R. Baer, assistant
director of that paper’s Bureau of Investigations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have your letter of April 14th, which was acknowledged on the 22nd, in re Aspirin.
For your information: Our rotogravure supplement is printed a number of days in advance
of the Sunday paper. When these copies which have already been printed are used, no further
Aspirin copy will appear. This means a loss of some four pages.”</p></div>

<p>How many of the numerous medical journals that are still carrying the
“Aspirin (Bayer)” advertising would make such a financial sacrifice for mere
principle?&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 25, 1918.</i>)</p>


<h4>“Aspirin”&mdash;A Common Name</h4>

<p>“Aspirin” as a trademark will no longer exist if the recommendation of
the Examiner of Interferences of the United States Patent Office is upheld, as
it probably would be, should the matter be taken to the courts. The opinion
of the Patent Office was the result of a petition by the United Drug Company
in the case of that company against the Bayer Company, or, as it was called
at the time the suit was brought, the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Company.
The stand taken by the Patent Office is directly in line with that that has been
held in this and other cases by <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, which has for years insisted
that it was against public policy to permit patentees to extend the seventeen-year
monopoly, which the patent laws grant, to a perpetual monopoly by the
simple device of obtaining a trademark for the name of the thing patented. It
is a fundamental principle in law that “no one can have a monopoly in the
name of anything.” This, of course, has been recognized and admitted even
by those manufacturers who have attempted to invoke the trademark laws to
obtain an unwarranted advantage.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of aspirin have held that the chemical name “mono­acetic­acid­ester
of salicylic acid” was the true name of the patented article, and
was the <i>only</i> name which became public property when the patent right
expired. The Patent Office points out, however, that for years the only name
that the public ever saw on the brand of mono­acetic­acid­ester of salicylic acid
made by the holders of the patent on this product was “Aspirin.” The Examiner
of Interferences in his decision points out that, previous to 1915, the
Bayer Company sold no tablets to the retail-purchasing public, but marketed
its product as a powder; further, that it did sell vast quantities of the powder
to tablet-makers, who sold “Aspirin Tablets,” and that the consuming public
knew the product only by the name “Aspirin.” This name, then, had a significance
to the purchaser, similar to that of the word “quinin” on a package
of quinin tablets, or the word “calomel” on a package of calomel tablets. As
the Patent Office says: “In other words, the <i>prima facie</i> significance of this
word ‘Aspirin’ to such purchasers was that of a name”&mdash;and as a name it is
“necessarily incapable of exclusive use by any one.”</p>

<p>The Patent Office’s decision also brings out the fact that, until the owners
of the aspirin patent commenced making tablets themselves, the aspirin tablets
on the market were not uniform, and that this lack of uniformity was a fraud
on the public which the owners of the aspirin patent should have prevented.
The concern did prevent it when it began to make the tablets itself, but
maintained in its contention against the United Drug Company that it was
unable to control the matter previously&mdash;a contention to which the Patent
Office gives short shrift. It is further pointed out that the Bayer Company
<span class="pagenum" title="485"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a></span>evidently recognized the weakness of its contention by the emphasis it placed
through its advertising on the “Bayer Cross.”</p>

<p>When the Bayer Company began manufacturing its own aspirin tablets, it
made a pretense of complying with the letter of the law, while violating its
spirit, by placing on the label under the word “Aspirin,” the statement that
“the mono­acetic­acid­ester of salicylic acid in these tablets is the reliable Bayer
manufacture.” Says the Patent Office: “With regard to the expression
‘mono­acetic­acid­ester of salicylic acid,’ a mere inspection of it is sufficient to
apprise any one of its inherent unsuitability for use as a name by the lay
purchasing public.” This attempt on the part of the company to “beat the
devil around a stump” tended, in the opinion of the Patent Office decision, “to
show that the respondent was familiar with the methods of some modern
traders to meet the trend of the law.” And, discussing such methods, the
Examiner of Interferences says: “A very popular one is for a trader to seemingly
bend to the necessity of the situation by placing on the label a notation
which in theory, but not in practice, may be used by the public to identify the
article after the monopoly has expired. To the examiner this practice seems
to be merely a manifestation of that keen commercial instinct which endeavors
to keep just ahead of the law. This instinct is fairly common in traders, and
is clearly disclosed in trademark infringement cases.”</p>

<p>Summed up, the decision is to the effect that, as in any case prior to 1915,
the public had been driven to look on the word “Aspirin” as the name of a
<i>thing</i>, and as the Bayer Company had not used the word as a “trademark”
within the meaning of the law, the Patent Office recommends that the registration
of “Aspirin” as a trademark be canceled. If no appeal is taken from this
decision, or in case an appeal is taken, should the opinion be sustained, the
attempt on the part of the patentees of aspirin to get a perpetual monopoly on
their product through the trademark laws will have been definitely defeated.&mdash;(<i>Editorial
from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 11, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h4>“Aspirin Bayer” and the Sterling Products Company</h4>

<p>A correspondent, who asks that his name be not published, writes:</p>

<p>“Your editorial on ‘Aspirin or Acetylsalicylic Acid&mdash;An Important Court
Decision’ is timely. Too often, I fear, physicians forget ‘what’s in a name.’ I
have been told that the Sterling Products Co., the present owners of the Aspirin-Bayer
rights, are manufacturers of other ‘patent medicines.’ Are they interested
in the Winthrop Chemical Company, which firm seems to be using the
much vaunted ‘Bayer Cross’ on the labels of the products formerly imported
from Germany by ‘The Bayer Company’? If you answer this in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
kindly omit my name.”</p>

<p>The recent history of Bayer &amp; Co., is somewhat as follows: Shortly after
the United States entered the war, the Alien Property Custodian took over the
property of Bayer &amp; Co. (Inc.) and its subsidiary, the Synthetic Patents Co. In
his report to congress the Custodian said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The stock of Bayer &amp; Co. (Inc.) and of Synthetic Patents Co. was sold by me at public
auction, the successful bidder being the Sterling Products Co., a West Virginia corporation
dealing in proprietary medicines. This company had previously agreed to dispose of the
dye plant and patents, in case it secured the property, to Grasselli Chemical Co., one of the
largest makers of heavy chemicals in the country. The price paid was $5,310,000, plus back
taxes and other obligations of many hundred thousands more.”</p></div>

<p>After the Sterling Products Company had acquired the pharmaceutical end
of the business, the Winthrop Chemical Co. was incorporated in the state of
New York. This concern seemingly secured control of all the Bayer pharmaceutical
specialties except “Aspirin.” The Bayer Co., it was announced, had
<span class="pagenum" title="486"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a></span>been merged with the Sterling Products Co., and “Aspirin-Bayer” added to
the latter firm’s list of “patent medicines”: Cascarets, Danderine, Pape’s
Diapepsin, California Syrup of Figs, Neuralgine and Dodson’s Livertone. The
business is apparently a paying one financially as witness the following
excerpt from a recent announcement in a drug journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Stockholders of the Sterling Products Co., Inc., of Wheeling, manufacturers of
Neuralgine, Cascarets, Bayer’s Aspirin, and other well known products, and the largest
proprietary medicine organization in the world, at their annual meeting received a report of
Manager W.&nbsp;E. Weiss, which showed that the company did a $10,000,000 business in 1920.
The total profits were $2,100,000, while a total of $1,080,000 was paid out in dividends.</p></div>

<p>Just what relationship exists between the Winthrop Chemical Co., and the
Sterling Products Co., we do not know. As our correspondent points out, the
“Bayer Cross” is used on the label of the Winthrop products.</p>

<p>The advertising campaign of “Aspirin, Bayer” since it entered the “patent
medicine” field has been typical of that field. By half truths and inferential
falsehoods the public has been led to believe that the only genuine aspirin on
the market is that put out under the Bayer name. The facts are, of course,
that the aspirin of any reputable firm is just as good as the aspirin put out by
the makers of Livertone, Danderine and Cascarets.</p>

<p>There is one point, however, that is of vital importance to the medical
profession; The decision recently rendered in the United States District Court
of Southern New York makes it obligatory for druggists, when filling a physician’s
prescription calling for “aspirin,” to dispense the Bayer product. When
the public buys aspirin on its own responsibility&mdash;without specifying any
particular brand&mdash;the druggist may give the purchaser any make of acetyl­salicylic
acid he sees fit. To repeat what was said in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s comment
on this decision: “Unless a physician wishes to cater to the concern owning
the Bayer rights and to aid in perpetuating what was a monopoly for seventeen
years, he should be careful to prescribe the drug under the term ‘acetyl­salicylic
acid,’ The court now places the responsibility directly on the medical profession.
Avoid ‘aspirin’&mdash;write ‘acetyl­salicylic acid.’&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 11, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE ALLIED MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS OF AMERICA</h3>

<h4>Another Rocket in the Pyrotechnics of Quasimedical Organizations</h4>


<p>It was once said, in the days when diploma mills flourished, that it seemed
easier to start a “university” than it was to open a grog shop. A study of
quasimedical organizations convinces one that it is easier to found a “medical
society” than it is to establish a peanut stand. Most reputable practitioners
of medicine who care to affiliate themselves with medical organizations are
members of the American Medical Association, its component societies, or
similar scientific bodies. It is not surprising then, that those who live and
move in the twilight zone of professionalism, from visionaries riding bizarre
medical hobbies to those who have special interests to exploit, should create
and make use of hybrid medical organizations. Such organizations multiply
as rapidly as rabbits. They flourish for a while, obtain more or less newspaper
and other publicity&mdash;usually more, because of the sensational methods
of those controlling them&mdash;then, having served the purpose of those who
brought them into being, they lapse into innocuous desuetude.</p>

<p>The official accouchement of the Allied Medical Associations of America
occurred, according to that organization’s report, May 18, 1918. On the official
<span class="pagenum" title="487"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a></span>stationery of the Allied Medical Associations of America in use in May, 1919,
we find the names of the “Officers,” “Censors,” etc. These constitute, presumably,
the more prominent members of this organization. We give briefly,
some data regarding some of these so that a rational perspective may be
obtained:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. M. Ottofy, M.D.</span>, St. Louis, Mo.&mdash;Dr. Ottofy seems to have been the
chief organizer, if not, indeed, the founder. He has been its “Secretary-Treasurer”
since its inception; he is also “editor” of its journal. Ottofy,
according to our records, was born in 1865 at Budapest, Hungary, and was
graduated in 1888 by the Homeopathic Medical College of Missouri. In
Polk’s Medical Directories for 1914 and 1917, Ottofy has those extended notices
which any physician can obtain who cares to pay for them. According to these
notices, Ottofy is, or has been, affiliated with the following “societies”:</p>

<p class="ml3em fs85">
President of the International Cancer Research Society.<br />
Ex-President of the St. Louis Society of Medical Research.<br />

<p>In December, 1911, numerous newspaper clippings show that Dr. Ottofy was
obtaining much publicity relative to his anti­vaccination activities. At that
time the papers reported that Ottofy was suing the St. Louis Board of Education
for $25,000 damages, because the board would not admit to the schools of
the city a child he had “internally” vaccinated. In November, 1913, the St.
Louis <i>Republic</i> reported that Ottofy had claimed to have discovered a serum
for the cure of cancer, and quoted Ottofy as claiming “a record of 72 per cent.
of cures” in “selected cases.” In February, 1914, the newspapers reported that
Ottofy was making a trip east “on the trail of radium for use in his practice
in the cure of cancer” and quoted him as stating, “I have learned on good
authority that there is radium in Missouri, and just where I refuse to divulge
at this time.” In January, 1915, the St. Louis <i>Republic</i> reported that Ottofy,
at a meeting of the “St. Louis Society of Medical Research,” had announced
that he had perfected a serum treatment for cancer, which “is curing patients
who have been pronounced incurable by so-called ‘cancer experts.’&#8239;” In
January, 1916, the St. Louis <i>Star</i> reported that Ottofy had sought an injunction
against the Board of Education of St. Louis to restrain it from using its funds
for “the maintenance of a Board of Hygiene.” In July, 1916, St. Louis papers
recorded that Ottofy, who was then running for coroner, had been cited to
appear before the prosecuting attorney to explain a charge of passing out, at
a political meeting, a card alleged to have borne an indecent drawing of President
Wilson. The prosecuting attorney was said to have instructed Ottofy
to bring the plates from which the cards were printed to his office. Two days
later the papers stated that Ottofy had sent the cards and plates by messenger
to the prosecuting attorney’s office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. La Doit Johnson, M.D.</span>, Chicago.&mdash;Dr. Johnson’s name appears as the
“First Vice-President” of the Allied Medical Associations of America. A few
years ago, Dr. Johnson’s name also appeared as the “Dean of the Faculty” of
the “American Post Graduate School.” This “school” was a mail-order concern
which, according to the “Annual Announcement,” would grant diplomas
and confer degrees as follows: “Master of Surgery,” “Bachelor of Medicine,”
“Bachelor of Science,” “Master of Electro-Therapy,” “Doctor of Osteopathy,”
“Doctor of Psychology,” “Master of Massage,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. M. Goehring, D.O., M.D.</span>, Pittsburgh, Pa.&mdash;The “Second Vice-President,”
according to the letterheads of the “Association” carries the letters D.O., M.D.,
after his name. So far as our records show, and they are most complete and
based on official data, H.&nbsp;M. Goehring is an osteopath, but not a doctor of
medicine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. E. Erling, M.D.</span>, Milwaukee, Wis.&mdash;A.&nbsp;E. Erling, according to the stationery,
is “Chairman” of “Censors.” Our records fail to show that Erling
ever graduated in medicine. The Health Department of Milwaukee, however,
says that Erling, when interviewed, claimed to have “a diploma from the German
Medical College of Chicago, but refused to show or present the same.”
The American Medical Directory has this item:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ml2em"><i>German Medical College</i>, Chicago. Chartered Dec. 28, 1891, by Johann Malok.
Fraudulent. Extinct.</p></div>

<p>A few years ago Erling was in La Crosse, Wis.; and in 1908 a circular
letter bearing his name and picture was sent out from which the following
extracts are taken. Capitalization as in the original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Friend:&mdash;Permit me to call your attention to the fact that Dr. A.&nbsp;E. Erling, the
eminent specialist, after many years of travel, practice and medical research, has given up his
extensive road practice and severed his connection with the several medical institutes which
have heretofore occupied considerable of his attention <span class="ell">..</span>. Dr. Erling’s success in the
treatment of all <span class="lowercase smcap">CHRONIC DISEASES</span> is truly remarkable. <span class="smcap">Nervousness</span>, all <span class="lowercase smcap">BLOOD DISEASES</span>,
<span class="lowercase smcap">RHEUMATISM</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">DISEASES PECULIAR TO WOMEN</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">CATARRH</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">DEAFNESS</span>, <span class="lowercase smcap">CHRONIC CONSTIPATION</span>

PERMANENT CURE</span>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> also has in its files advertisements (vintage of 1915), from
some Wisconsin country newspapers, which notify the afflicted that “Drs.
Erling and Karass, the expert German Specialists,” could be seen in their
offices in the “Schlegel Hotel,” the “Schlitz Hotel,” etc., as the case might be.
Whether one of these “German Specialists” was Dr. Arnold E. Erling, <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> does not know. Official medical records fail to show, at least, that
there is any other Erling in the state of Wisconsin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W. W. Fritz, M.D.</span>, Philadelphia.&mdash;Another of the “Censors.” This presumably
is W. Wallace Fritz, M.D., D.D.S., N.D., D.O., D.C., who was the
“Dean” of the “American College of Neuropathy,” and “Professor of Neuropathy”
at the same institution. According to newspaper reports published when
the “dean” of the American College of Neuropathy was called into court to
testify regarding the “school,” Fritz admitted that when he became dean of
this “college,” the “college” had three students and thirty “Faculty Members”!
Fritz, it should be mentioned in passing, is a member of the Philadelphia
County Medical Society and by virtue of this membership he has qualified as
a Fellow of the American Medical Association! Recently Fritz’s name appeared
in connection with the formation of a new organization, founded, it appears,
for the laudable purpose of fighting the “Medical Trust.” Fritz, according to
<span class="pagenum" title="489"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a></span>the newspaper reports, is treasurer of this new organization, which has
adopted the inspiring title, “Constitutional Liberty League of America” and
seems to be a later edition of the mushroom “National League for Medical
Freedom.” Quoting from the newspaper report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. W. Wallace Fritz, a member of the American Medical Association, created a profound
impression when he said that all health laws were written by agents of, or members of, the
American Medical Association, and that this organization was at once the most powerful
and the most baneful of all the American Trusts. Dr. Fritz then went on to say: ‘Most
of the drugs administered are worthless. Most of the doctors who prescribe them are
incompetent, but both the injurious drug and the ignorant prescriber are protected, in and
out of court, by the American Medical Association, which trust is now raising a vast fund
with which to drive all drugless healers out of the profession. Medicine is the camouflage
used to conceal the most alert, the most rapacious and the least patriotic of all the trusts
milking the American people. The tyranny of the Medical Trust is unbelievable. It is also
un-American.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>The Philadelphia <i>Sunday Transcript</i> of May 4, 1919, had a five column
article under the name of W. Wallace Fritz. It is a most vituperative affair,
and reeks with fire and brimstone. It is directed chiefly against the American
Medical Association, and physicians are dubbed “Prescription Writing Drug
Peddlers Who Prosper Through Monopolistic Laws Rather than by the Practice
of an Exact Science.” In the course of this diatribe we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The members of the American Medical Association are manifesting an unwarranted
interest in the dear people, who, in their assumption, need quinin and mercurial guardian;
who under this class legislation confines us to this monopoly of the big and little pill, is
trying by hook and crook to shut out the natural and rational methods of cure which are
driving the drug monopoly from the face of the earth. Diagnosis and consultation consist
in four or five medical doctors, whose faces denote death, sitting around a sick man and
guessing what ails him. After that has been performed they guess at what will cure him,
and that is generally a sure sign the undertaker will follow.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">C. O. Linder, M.D.</span>, Spokane, Wash.&mdash;This gentleman (another “Censor”),
seems to be an osteopath, who some years ago was “Assistant Secretary” of
the “Washington’s Physicians’ Association,” founded apparently by rebels within
the osteopathic ranks who denounced the Washington Osteopathic Association
as a “professional trust”! Linder apparently claims graduation in 1905 from
the “Thompsonian Medical College” of Allentown, Pa. The following item
from the American Medical Directory regarding this school is of interest:</p>

<p class="ml2em">“<i>Thompsonian Medical College</i>, Allentown. Organized in 1904.
Fraudulent. No evidence to show classes were ever held.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H. Flower, M.D.</span>, Boston.&mdash;Still another “Censor.” Flower, according to
the notice that appears in Polk’s Directory for 1917, claims graduation in 1888
from the “American Health College” of Cincinnati, and in 1894 from the
“American Health University” of Chicago. Quoting again from the American
Medical Directory, here is what we find regarding the former “college”:</p>

<p class="ml2em">“<i>American Health College</i>, Cincinnati. Organized in 1874 and
re-organized in 1876. Conducted by a Dr. Campbell who originated
and copyrighted the so-called ‘Vitapathic System,’ Fraudulent.
Extinct about 1888.”</p>

<p>We have no record of an “American Health University” of Chicago, although
there was an “Illinois Health University” of Chicago, one of the numerous
diploma-mill swindles operated by Armstrong. It was declared fraudulent by
the federal authorities and its charter was revoked in 1897. Flower, according
to the notice in Polk’s Directory, is:</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Z. L. Baldwin, M.D.</span>, Kalamazoo, Mich.&mdash;Possibly the data just given concerning
some of those whose names appeared on the organization’s stationery
are more than sufficient for the average physician to get a perspective of the
Allied Medical Associations of America. Still, it is worth mentioning that in
a letter recently sent out by Ignatz Mayer, extending an invitation to the annual
convention of the Allied Medical Associations of America, Mayer took the
opportunity of incorporating in his letter a letter which one of the members
of the “association” had been sending out, urging individuals to join. The
member in question was Dr. Z.&nbsp;L. Baldwin of Kalamazoo, Mich. Dr. Baldwin,
as some of our readers may remember, is the gentleman who, a few years ago,
was exploiting an “Intravenous Treatment” for the cure of tuberculosis. According
to the claims made at that time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. for the first time in the history of medicine, we have a successful treatment
for tuberculosis.</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. we are able to kill the germs of the disease in the body, thoroughly ridding it
of all tubercular infection, destroying the germ and its poisons likewise.”</p></div>

<p>This was a few years ago. Whether Dr. Baldwin is still specializing in
consumption we do not know; apparently not, as we notice that at the first
meeting of the Allied Medical Associations, Baldwin’s name was on the program
for the “Cure of Goiter by Adjustment of Lenses.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Starr White, M.D., F.S.Sc., Lond.</span>, Los Angeles, Calif.&mdash;A letter
received by a physician a few days before the recent convention of the Allied
Medical Associations, held out as an inducement to be present the fact that
“Geo. S. White will show you how to diagnose disease by means of dif. colored
lights and the reaction of the body to the magnetic meridian.” Dr. George
Starr White was the “Second Vice-President” of the Allied Medical Associations
in 1918. White, according to our records, was graduated in 1908 when he
was forty-two years old, by the New York Homeopathic Medical College and
Hospital. He was licensed in New York in 1908, in California, Connecticut
and Nevada in 1913, and in Michigan in 1916. He seems to have been one of
the proponents of “spondylo­therapy,” “zonetherapy,” etc., and in 1915 it was
announced that he would give one week courses in “Spondylo­therapy” in
Chicago, Kansas City and Denver, respectively. In his advertisement he
emphasized that he was a Fellow of the American Medical Association, which,
while true at the time, is no longer true, as on Feb. 4, 1916, he was expelled
from membership in the Los Angeles County Medical Association. In May,
1915, White was arrested in Chicago and fined $100 and costs for practicing
medicine without a license. Dr. White’s specialty seems to be what is
ponderously known as “Bio-Dynamo-Chromatic Diagnosis.” This has been
described by one of its enthusiastic adherents as “Diagnosis by Sympathetic
Vagal-Reflex.” To obtain the “Sympathetic Vagal-Reflex” it seems the
patient must face east or west and have his bare abdomen percussed until a
dull area is located. The patient is then faced north or south and again percussed.
Then, it seems, different colored lights are thrown on the patient, the
location of the areas of dullness being determined meanwhile. A combination
of ruby and blue lights “will cause a reflex in cases of gonorrhea,” a “green
light will cause a reflex in cases of liver or gallbladder trouble,” while the
color for carcinoma is orange red! During the height of the influenza epidemic
last winter, White seems to have put on the market “Valens Essential Oil
Tablets” which were for “Gripping the Flu out of Influenza,” and were also
said greatly to benefit or cure incipient tuberculosis, hay-fever, asthma, and
“catar.” The letters “F.S.Sc., Lond.” after Dr. White’s name look well,
sound well, and have an air of erudition and mystery that is well worth
<span class="pagenum" title="491"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a></span>what they cost. They mean “Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Science,
Letters and Arts of London, Ltd.” The “Fellowship” costs one guinea. Not
a few “patent medicine” exploiters in the United States carry these mystic
letters after their names. The society in question was a seriocomic concern
that was exposed by London <i>Truth</i> some years ago and was also dealt with
in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> of May 29, 1909, in connection with the “Aicsol Consumption
Cure” exposé.</p>

<p>So much for the Allied Medical Associations of America. At their recent
meeting in New York City they got much newspaper publicity because of
their action on the prohibition question. According to the newspaper reports,
the organization adopted a resolution declaring that “properly brewed lager
beer is absolutely essential in the treatment of certain cases.” They were
further reported as endorsing the manufacture of light wines and of beer
containing not to exceed 2.75 per cent. alcohol. As a piece of publicity work
this resolution was all that its sponsors could expect. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> office
was flooded with telegrams and letters from physicians, temperance workers,
congressmen, church organizations, and others, asking, in effect, What <i>is</i> the
Allied Medical Associations of America? This is our apology for giving the
amount of space necessary to a proper understanding of this organization.
Today the rocket of the Allied Medical Associations of America is blazing a
more or less erratic course across the sky of publicity. The stick will be down
anon! Any resolution or expression of opinion by this organization, or others
of its type, when dealing with the broader problems of public health, is wholly
without scientific significance, whether such resolutions are good, bad or
indifferent.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 5, 1919.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>“ARSENICALS”</h3>


<p>The September issue of the <i>Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology</i>
presents a number of significant features regarding the use of arsphenamin
and related compounds that are at present being widely employed in the treatment
of syphilis. To one who studies these statements of laboratory and
clinical investigators in the special field involved there must come the conviction
that many therapeutic perplexities still remain at the end of nearly a
decade of trial for the types of compounds which Ehrlich introduced. It is
well for the practitioner to realize this, especially when expert workers still
make an appeal for conservative interpretations. Stokes forcefully summarized
the situation when he stated at the New Orleans session of the
American Medical Association:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Too short a time has elapsed since the discovery of these drugs, and too little is as yet
known about the ultimate problems of the pathology, immunology and parasitology of syphilis,
to justify the announcing of new infallibilities. The necropsy pathologist of the next fifty
years may well, like Warthin, upset our most plausible generalizations of today. Seasoned
tradition and conservatism are still the wisest guides in our interpretation of clinical cure.
Arsphenamin has made it apparently possible and even probable, but only to the inexperienced
has cure been made absolute and inevitable.</p></div>

<p>It is recognized that the exact composition of arsphenamin in its available
form is not fully determined. As has been emphasized again, the quantitative
determination of arsenic alone in arsphenamin is insufficient to estimate its
purity; in fact, the interstate sale of arsphenamin is controlled by toxicity
tests on guinea-pigs made by the Hygienic Laboratory of the United States
Public Health Service. Consequently, practical medicine must be on its guard
to employ a product which is carefully controlled by such toxicity tests as
<span class="pagenum" title="492"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a></span>well as by other criteria. It will not do to charge untoward results offhand
solely to idiosyncrasy of the patient, faulty administration or other errors in
technic. The drug itself still has inherent dangers. It should be borne in
mind also that neo-arsphenamin behaves differently in the animal organism
from arsphenamin, and should not be regarded simply as arsphenamin in a
convenient form for administration.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to learn from a government expert that after the long
struggle to produce satisfactory products, arsphenamin preparations made in
the United States are generally less toxic than those of foreign manufacture.
Neo-arsphenamin preparations made in the United States compare favorably,
and in certain instances are decidedly less toxic than most of the foreign
products. Timely presentations of the faults and dangers as well as the
undisputed advantages of current therapy in the management of syphilis
should be welcomed.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 9, 1920.</i>)</p>


<h4>Pharmacology of Arsenicals</h4>

<p>The Public Health Service some time <span class="nowrap">ago<a name="FNanchor_262_278" id="FNanchor_262_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_278" class="fnanchor">262</a></span> warned against the use in
syphilis of new arsenicals which are not related to arsphenamin; it was
stated that a number of such were being sold with unwarranted claims as to
their value. At least three such arsenicals have in recent years been the subject
of some exploitation for use in this disease: sodium cacodylate, the
sodium salt of methyl arsenic acid (“Arrhenal”) and the sodium salt of ethyl
arsenic acid (“Mon-Arsone”)<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_263_279" id="FNanchor_263_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_279" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> As regards the first two, Castelli showed
several years ago that neither has any action on experimental trypanosomiasis
and spirochete infections; careful clinical observations in this country have
confirmed the inefficacy of sodium cacodylate in human syphilis<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_264_280" id="FNanchor_264_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_280" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> Voegtlin
and <span class="nowrap">Smith<a name="FNanchor_265_281" id="FNanchor_265_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_281" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> of the Hygienic Laboratory have now shown in animal experiments
that ethyl arsenic acid (“Mon-Arsone”) is devoid of any practical
trypanocidal action. Thus the “therapeutic ratio” (the ratio of the minimal
effective dose to the lethal dose) was about 1, that is, it was effective thera­peutically
only in approximately fatal doses, the therapeutic ratio for arsphenamin
in similar conditions was 17, and that of neo-arsphenamin, 28. In fact,
the conditions with ethyl arsenic acid were no more favorable than were those
with arsenous acid (the active constituent of solution of potassium arsenite),
although it was far less poisonous. The validity of such experiments in determining
the probable value of drugs in human syphilis cannot be questioned<span class="nowrap">:<a name="FNanchor_266_282" id="FNanchor_266_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_282" class="fnanchor">266</a></span>
it was by such experiments that Ehrlich and his co-workers found two or
three of six hundred and six arsenic preparations studied to be of value, and
of the next three hundred or more studied only one (neo-arsphenamin)
worthy of trial in human medicine. The time has passed when a high arsenic
content of a compound and a low toxicity, and a number of cases of apparent
clinical improvement, can be assumed to indicate that a drug has any real
value in the treatment of syphilis. Many organic compounds of arsenic as
well as other drugs may cause temporary or apparent improvement in syphilis,
but to date only those related to arsphenamin have proved of real value and
comparatively safe. Others which had some real value proved to have dangerous
side effects; readers will recall the history of arsanilic acid (“Atoxyl” or
“Soamin”) and its acetyl derivative (“Arsacetin”).&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 26, 1921.</i>)</p>

<h4>Salvarsan: Abrogate the Patent</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has already commented on the difficulty in securing salvarsan,
on the moral and ethical question as to whether or not it is justifiable for one
person to control the output of a drug necessary to public health. This week
we publish an account of the action of the St. Louis and Chicago medical
societies, which are calling on the medical profession to appeal to their senators
and congressmen to abrogate this patent. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> believes that this
patent should be abrogated, not alone because the patentees have not supplied
the demand, not alone because they have dictated to the medical profession
who should have the drug and how much a physician might have, not alone
because of the war with Germany, not alone because of the special needs of
the government at this time for the control of venereal diseases, not alone
because, as some claim, the patent at Washington does not correctly describe
the product, but also because the people who are supplying this product are
charging prices that are exorbitant compared to the price at which others in
this country can supply it. The fact is that the salvarsan one can obtain today
costs $4.50 per ampule of 0.6 gram, whereas the same dose of arsenobenzol&mdash;a
preparation identical with, if not better than, salvarsan&mdash;costs $2.00 at retail,
and as Dr. Schamberg says: “If we are permitted to continue marketing the
same drug after the war, we can sell it at $1.00 or less per tube.” To abrogate
this patent would be doing an injury to no one. Certainly the patentees of
salvarsan have already reaped their harvest&mdash;and a pretty rich one. The
supply of salvarsan at a reasonable price in proportion to its actual cost of
production is in the interest of the health of the entire population of the
country, whereas to let matters rest as they are, is to the benefit of one man.
While we are emphasizing here the cost, there is after all a greater question,
and that is the supply necessary to help control the ravages of one of the
most serious diseases which afflict humanity today. It is the duty of Congress
to abrogate the patent on this preparation and, incidentally, on all medicinal
preparations of importance.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 21,
1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>End the Monopoly</h4>

<p>The Adamson Bill, known as the “trading with the enemy act,” has recently
been passed by the House of Representatives, is now before the Senate, and
will doubtless be enacted into a law. One of its clauses confers authority on
the Federal Trade Commission to grant licenses to citizens of this country to
operate patents owned by enemy aliens. Physicians are interested in the bill
primarily because it includes the salvarsan situation. The manner in which
salvarsan has been supplied in this country has been so arbitrary and the prices
charged so tremendously above the actual cost, that we should not be satisfied
unless the monopoly is ended so that the drug can be supplied at least at a
fairly moderate figure, and the old methods eliminated. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that the Federal Trade Commission will not grant exclusive control&mdash;that
is, exclusive license&mdash;to any one person or firm. To do so would simply
perpetuate the old monopoly and the old conditions. England has adopted a
law, which, in principle, is similar to the Adamson Bill, and there several concerns
have been licensed to manufacture the product. The same should be
done here. The Dermatologic Research Laboratories of Philadelphia announce
that they can supply arsenobenzol at $1.50 a tube, and that there is immediately
available a supply sufficient for any demand that may be made. The same
laboratories have announced also that in a few months they will be able to
supply hospitals for $1.00 a tube. Considerable responsibility rests on the
Federal Trade Commission in this matter, for it is not only a question of
monopoly, but also a question of scientific qualifications and ability to make
the product on the part of some who may make application. Undoubtedly the
<span class="pagenum" title="494"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a></span>commission will secure the cooperation of the United States Public Health
Service, under whose supervision these drugs should be manufactured no
matter who shall be licensed to make the product.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 21, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Arsphenamin</h4>

<p>No, this is not a new chemical; it is simply the name adopted by the
Federal Trade Commission for the hydrochlorid of 3-diamino-4-dihydroxy-1-arseno­benzene&mdash;in
other words, salvarsan. As our readers already have been
informed three firms have been licensed to manufacture and sell arsphenamin;
but, while each manufacturer may have his own trade name on the label, the
official name must be the prominent one on all packages. Hence, physicians
should at once make it a point to learn and use the name “arsphenamin” in
place of salvarsan. At first sight, arsphenamin looks formidable. In reality,
it is just as easy to familiarize oneself with the word “arsphenamin” as it
was to learn to use the terms “salvarsan,” “arsenobenzol” or any other of the
trade names.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 19, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>BEER AND CANCER CURES</h3>

<h4>Did the Brewing Interests Advertise Autolysin?</h4>


<p>Our readers may remember that an article appeared in this department of
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> for July 6, 1918, under the title “Henry Smith Williams and
‘Proteal Therapy.’&#8239;” “Proteal Therapy” is a treatment exploited by Henry
Smith Williams, M.D., of New York, for use in tuberculosis, cancer, rheumatism,
etc. It is apparently a modification of the “Autolysin” cancer “cure”
which Williams had previously puffed in <i>Heart’s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s article pointed out that Henry Smith Williams, although
entitled to write “M.D.” after his name, is essentially a journalist. He has
written voluminously for some years in lay publications on various subjects,
both under his own name and under his <i>nom de plume</i>, “Stoddard Goodhue,
M.D.” In addition, Williams runs a publishing concern called the Goodhue
Company, which issues a number of books, many of them being reprints of
Williams’ own articles.</p>

<p>Closely associated with Henry Smith Williams is his brother, Edward
Huntington Williams, who also is a prolific writer. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s previous
article called attention to the fact that there had been sent broadcast to
physicians a neat little cloth-bound book, entitled, “Alcohol, Hygiene and
Legislation.” This book, which evidently cost somebody a good deal of money
to distribute gratis, was published by the Goodhue Company, and was written
by Edward Huntington Williams. Enclosed with the book was an advertising
leaflet on the “Autolysin” cancer cure and also a letter from the Goodhue
Company, asking physicians to accept it “with our compliments and the compliments
of the author.” The letter was chiefly devoted to calling attention to
Henry Smith Williams’ “new book, the Autolysin Treatment of Cancer.” The
last thirteen pages of the book “Alcohol, Hygiene and Legislation” contained
advertisements of the Goodhue Company’s publications, particular emphasis
being placed on the “Autolysin Treatment of Cancer,” by Henry Smith Williams.</p>

<p>So much by way of retrospect. Now comes information that may throw
an interesting side-light on the matter just presented. There is at present
being conducted by a committee of the United States Senate, an investigation
relative to the purchase of a Washington (D.&nbsp;C.) newspaper with money
alleged to have been furnished by those interested in the brewing industry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="495"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></span></p>
<p>At the opening hearing before the Senate Committee, Tuesday, November
19, the secretary of the United States Brewers’ Association, after admitting that
brewers’ propaganda had been published in the <i>International Monthly</i>, edited
by Viereck (of the <i>Fatherland</i>), also declared that the Publication Committee
of the brewers’ association employed writers to “write up certain subjects”
relating to the brewers’ trade. One of the writers mentioned in this connection
was, according to the newspaper reports, “Dr. Edward H. Williams, author
of articles published in medical and other journals.”</p>

<p>With this fact before us, it seemed worth while to go through the book that
had been distributed so lavishly to physicians with the compliments of the
Goodhue Company and Dr. Edward Huntington Williams, in the exploitation
of “Autolysin,” and Henry Smith Williams’ book on the subject.</p>

<p>The first chapter of “Alcohol, Hygiene and Legislation” consists of a reprint
of an article from the <i>New York Medical Journal</i> of May 8, 1915. The article
is a skilful presentation of the case for the defenders of the lighter alcoholic
beverages, especially beer. This chapter and all succeeding chapters of the
book attempt to discredit prohibitory legislation, and argue that prohibition
drives the public to the use of the more ardent alcoholic beverages, while
preventing the use of the milder beverages, such as beer, which one is led to
infer is not particularly harmful. Throughout the book, also, the state of
Kansas is held up as an example of the harm done by prohibition, and the
theme is developed that insanity and the use of cocain and other habit-forming
drugs follows in the wake of prohibition. The following extracts are from
Chapter I:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The evil effects of <i>beer</i> and wine, for example, are greatly less than those produced by
spirituous liquors<span class="ell">...</span>. [Italics ours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>If our theory of immunity is correct we should expect to find that the older beverages,
such as <i>beer</i> and wine, which have been used for thousands of years, are less productive of
alcoholic insanity, for example, than the spirituous liquors which are recent innovations. In
point of fact we find this to be the case: the spirituous liquors are almost wholly responsible
for all forms of alcoholic insanity. [Italics ours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></div>

<p>Chapter II is a reprint of an article that appeared in <i>Everybody’s Magazine</i>,
August 1914, and deals with “Legislation from a Medical Viewpoint.” It is to
the effect that drug addiction and insanity, together with special forms of
mental disease directly attributable to alcoholism, seem to flourish best in prohibition
territory.</p>

<p>Chapter III deals with “The Peace and War Footing of Alcohol,” and is
a reprint from the <i>Medical Record</i>, Aug. 7, 1915. It, too, sings the praises
of the “lighter beverages,” while deprecating the use of “ardent spirits.” For
instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An overwhelmingly large proportion of persons who develop alcoholic psychoses in America
are drinkers of whisky, or some corresponding ardent spirit, whereas this condition is seldom
seen in <i>beer</i> and wine drinkers. [Italics ours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>Thus we find the highest percentage of alcohol psychoses among the whisky drinkers who
come from western Europe, while the wine and <i>beer</i> drinking races of central and southern
Europe show a distinctly lower percentage, in some instances only about one-fourth as many
per thousand. [Italics ours.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></div>

<p>Chapter IV deals with “Some Aspects of Liquor Legislation.” Like Chapter
II it is an indictment of prohibition, and the United States Census Bureau’s
reports are called on to sustain this thesis. Quotations, too, are made from the
writings of Henry Smith Williams further to prove the point. “Dry” Kansas
and “wet” Nebraska are frequently compared, to the detriment of the former.
One who accepts the statements in this chapter will get the impression that
Kansas has more lawlessness, illiteracy, pauperism, and insanity than Nebraska.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" title="496"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a></span></p>
<p>Chapter V deals with “The Problem of Legislation.” It is based on the
premise that “prohibition does not prevent the consumption of liquor,” but on
the contrary, “prohibitive legislation induces the consumption of the most
harmful form of liquors.” Stated in another way, it is equivalent to charging
that prohibition is hard on the brewers, but beneficial to the distillers. In
fact, E.&nbsp;H. Williams, in another book (“The Question of Alcohol”&mdash;Goodhue
Co.) which also champions the case for the milder alcoholics, quotes Henry
Smith Williams as saying, relative to prohibitory legislation: “In general, it
would appear that, if our legislators of recent years had been in league with
the distiller, they could not have served his purpose better.”</p>

<p>Whether or not Edward H. Williams’ or Henry Smith Williams’ conception
of the alcohol problem is good, bad or indifferent, need not at this time concern
us. The medical profession, however, has a right to ask two questions: First,
Is the Dr. Edward Huntington Williams who wrote “Alcohol, Hygiene and
Legislation” the “Dr. Edward H. Williams” who was employed by the brewers
to write propaganda favorable to the brewing interests? Second, Was the
cloth-bound book, “Alcohol, Hygiene and Legislation,” which was distributed by
the Williams brothers, paid for, wholly or in part, by the United States
Brewers’ Association?</p>

the alcohol question, the following bibliography may be of service:</p>

<h3>BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTICS AND ITS COMMERCIAL DOMINATION</h3>


<p>The danger of commercialized therapeutics has been enormously increased
by the introduction of biologic products. These substances offer a rich field
for the commercially minded, first, because of the remarkable results which
seem to have followed the use of certain products of this type; second, because
the field is new and the mode of action of these substances not readily understood
and, third&mdash;and most important&mdash;because, by the very nature of the
problems involved, few physicians are well informed concerning them. The
influenza epidemic of last year was widespread and fatal in character. It
stimulated earnest research in methods of prevention and cure. We were all
in a frame of mind to grasp at any straw. Here and there some worker would
cry “Eureka”&mdash;only to be disappointed when his product was actually put to
the test. However, there were more than enough manufacturers ready to place
any product on the market with specious claims that could not be positively
denied. Vaccines, serums, proteins&mdash;all were advanced with such glowing
statements as to their properties that only those physicians who kept their
feet firmly on solid ground could resist the appeal. Now we have had another
epidemic&mdash;mild, it is true&mdash;but the memories of last year make the average
physician ready to accept anything which promises hope, and the manufacturers
“make hay while the sun shines.” Physicians have been and are being deluged
with literature on the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. So far as we
know, few publications have contained any word of warning on these matters.
One exception has just come to notice: the <i>Medico-Military Review</i>, a semimonthly
<span class="pagenum" title="497"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a></span>mimeographed publication sent to medical officers of the Army by the
Surgeon General’s Office. This says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">You Are Reminded</span> that so far a comprehensive analysis of results obtained by the use
of monovalent and polyvalent vaccines in the prevention of influenza has not demonstrated
their value. Much carefully controlled experimental work is now being carried out on this
subject both in civil institutions and in the Army, and any worthwhile advances will be
reported in the <i>Review</i> from time to time. If a prospective vaccine is developed, it will
be prepared at the Army Medical School for general distribution and all medical officers will
be duly notified. The general use of the present commercial polyvalent protective against
influenza is not considered desirable. Numerous telegrams and other requisitions are being
received for influenza vaccine. In view of the fact that no prophylactic influenza vaccine
is available, such requisitions should be discontinued.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>CAPELL’S UROLUETIC TEST</h3>


<p class="tar pr2 pt1 fs85"><span class="smcap">U. S. Marine Hospital</span>, Chicago.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;A member of the consultant staff of this hospital
recently referred to us a “Doctor” H.&nbsp;F. Matthews, who was supposed to
give demonstrations of a new test for syphilis&mdash;“Capell’s ‘Uroluetic’ Test.”
The test was to be made of the urine of the patient. The above mentioned
consultant was under the impression that the said “Doctor” Matthews was
a graduate physician.</p>

<p>“Doctor” Matthews came to the hospital according to the appointment
made by the consultant, and proceeded to give his demonstration. Several
of the junior officers and interns were present to witness it. He was asked
questions in an attempt to determine the scientific status of the test which
he was demonstrating. His answers were always vague and indefinite and
not clothed in scientific words.</p>

<p>We became suspicious of him, and he was asked if he was a graduate
physician. He admitted that he was not. He was further asked if he had
studied chemistry and bacteriology; he stated that he had in 1888. Inquiry
was made as to where; he replied that it was at the University of Illinois.
He was further asked if he was familiar with the Wassermann reaction.
He stated that he was not.</p>

<p>This man is going around representing himself as a physician who has
a new test which he claims is superior to, and more delicate than, the
Wassermann test; yet he knows nothing whatever of the technic of the
Wassermann reaction.</p>

<p>In one case, we gave him the same specimen of urine in four different
containers. He read a different degree of reaction for each of them. In
other words, in a specimen from the same patient, his four different tests
showed, respectively, a&nbsp;+, a&nbsp;++, a&nbsp;+++ and a&nbsp;++++ reaction.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that it might be well to inform you of this man’s
methods, as he told us that he had been to a good many institutions, and I
am sure he will soon start a plan to systematically force his pseudoscientific
test on credulous physicians everywhere.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">J. O. Cobb, M.D.</span>, Senior Surgeon in Charge.</p>
</div>

<p>The Propaganda Department has in its files a business card reading:
“Capell’s Laboratories, Room 1510 Masonic Temple, Chicago. Dr. H.&nbsp;F. Matthews,
Special Representative.” Capell’s Laboratory has its headquarters in
Omaha, and is apparently conducted by Dr. W.&nbsp;L. Capell, who, for many years,
seems to have been more or less interested in proprietary medicines. Some
years ago he was connected with a concern known as “Acneine Pharmacal
Company,” which, apparently, was dissolved some time in 1910; and soon thereafter
a new company was organized known as the LeRoy Drug Company. In
1917 W.&nbsp;L. Capell was connected with the Capell, Cameron Co., Inc., of Lincoln,
<span class="pagenum" title="498"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a></span>Neb., which was selling “Capell’s Uroluetic Test”, “Capell’s Treatment
for Syphilis” and other remedies. The “Treatment for Syphilis” was said
to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Painless, Pleasant, Harmless, Efficacious, and requires usually from 30 to 90 days only
to eradicate the disease.”</p></div>

<p>The name of the treatment is “Mercarodin”&mdash;earlier it was called “Camit”&mdash;and
it is now being sold from “Capell’s Laboratory,” Omaha. In addition,
Capell’s Laboratory sells Acneine, which apparently is the same product that
was sold in 1906 and 1907 under the name of “Sambu-Co” by the Holtman-Stringer
Co. of Omaha and later was put out by the Acneine Pharmacal Company
of Omaha.</p>

<p>While Capell’s Laboratory sells proprietary remedies, it is the “Uroluetic
Test” which the concern now seems to be featuring. The claims made for
this are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This test requires no expert knowledge, is inexpensive, and can be made in a few
minutes, and is so plain that it cannot be mistaken.”</p></div>

<p>The idea of being able to determine the absence or presence of syphilis by
a simple color test of the urine is a fascinating one. The present reliable
diagnostic tests are, as Capell’s Laboratory so plausibly emphasizes, somewhat
involved, and call for rather delicate technic. But there are no short-cuts to
knowledge.</p>

<p>A physician who ordered Capell’s Uroluetic Test some weeks ago received
with the bill the letter that follows: It is given not so much for what it says,
as for how it says it. It is copied <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your letter received, and we have mailed you as per your letter 1 Doz. of Capell’s
‘Uroluetic’ Tests. In close find statement and instructions, for same.</p>

<p>“The ‘Uroluetic’ Test is meeting a far greater approval from the Medical profession than
we had expected, while we do not claime that it is perfect, yet we have only received one
unfavorable report, and we daily feel incuraged in its efficacy.</p>

<p>“You know Doctor that there are two dangerous elements in this world, one is the
extreme pessimist and the other is the extreme optimist. The immoral Lincoln said, ‘That
there was nothing that was wholly good or wholly evil,’ and we presume that this is equally
true of the ‘Uroluetic’ test. But we want the truth no matter what it is.”</p></div>

<p>“Capell’s Uroluetic Test” would be “important if true.” Unfortunately, its
scientific value to the sufferer is negligible compared with its economic value
to the exploiter. It is not so much a test for lues in the patient as of credulity
in the doctor.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 23, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h4>Another Urinary Test for Syphilis</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Will you kindly inform me whether the test in the enclosed “literature”
is what it is represented to be?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Charles M. Thomas, M.D.</span>, Sunbury, Pa.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The “literature” referred to by Dr. Thomas dealt with the “Uri-Na
Test” sold by the Standard Appliance Company of Philadelphia. There
seems to be a strong family resemblance between this alleged test and that
known as “Capell’s Uroluetic Test,” which was discussed in the Propaganda
Department of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 23, 1919. Of that <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> said:
“Unfortunately, its scientific value to the sufferer is negligible compared with
its economic value to the exploiter. It is not so much a test for lues in the
patient as of credulity in the doctor.” The same may be said of the “Uri-Na
Test.” The facts are, there is no method at present known by which the
absence or presence of syphilis may be determined by a simple color test of
the urine.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 22, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>CHEMOTHERAPY AND TUMORS&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_Q_283" id="FNanchor_Q_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_283" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a><a name="FNanchor_R_284" id="FNanchor_R_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_284" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></h3>

<h4>Richard Weil, M.D., New York</h4>



<p>Within the last three years a number of reports have appeared in the
medical press which bear on the treatment of malignant growths in human
beings by chemical preparations. The most persuasive and the most insistent
claims have been made in connection with the colloidal solutions of certain
metalloids and metals, notably selenium, vanadium and copper. At the same
time a number of drug houses, both in this country and abroad, have placed
on the market proprietary preparations of these substances in various forms,
for which the claim is made that they produce striking therapeutic effects and
sometimes even cures in malignant neoplasms.</p>

<p>The impulse toward the use and production of this type of preparation is
directly traceable to a series of scientific experiments on the tumors of animals,
which date back no farther than the year 1911. In that year Wassermann
and his co-<span class="nowrap">workers<a name="FNanchor_267_285" id="FNanchor_267_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_285" class="fnanchor">267</a></span> published a report on the treatment of rat tumors by
means of the intravenous injection of selenium compounds. This paper
received wide notoriety through its enthusiastic diffusion by the lay press.
Shortly afterward Neuberg and his co-<span class="nowrap">workers<a name="FNanchor_268_286" id="FNanchor_268_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_286" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> published their observations
upon the therapeutic effects of certain metallic compounds. The clinical application
of the encouraging results obtained by these authors in animal tumors
followed rapidly, and up to the present time a number of papers have appeared
in which the claim is made that human tumors also may be favorably influenced
through the constitutional use of substances similar to those used by Wassermann
or Neuberg. In some cases, use has been made of colloidal solutions of
the heavy metals, such as copper; in others, selenium compounds have been
used, while in a third set of observations the therapeutic agent represents an
attempt to combine the virtues of these two types of therapy by employing
selenium in colloidal form. As an example of the first class, may be cited
the cuprase of Gaube du Gers<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_269_287" id="FNanchor_269_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_287" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> of the second, the selenio­vanadic ointment of
Roemer and the sulpho-selene of Walker; of the third, seleniol and electro-selenium.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this new type of cancer therapy derives its origin, its justification
and its support, in very large measure, from the laboratory results obtained
in animals, it is a matter of considerable importance to examine those results
with care, in order to determine whether they furnish a satisfactory basis for
human therapy, and whether they justify the hopes to which they have given
rise.</p>

<p>It is safe to assert that the application of chemotherapy to the treatment of
tumors practically dates from the publications of Wassermann. He stated
the principle that a rational therapy of tumors must be based on constitutional
treatment. It appears evident that local treatment can have only local effects.
The lymphatic extensions of tumorous growths, and the often unsuspected
metastases in distant organs must of necessity escape the effects of purely
local treatment. Hence, Wassermann reached the conclusion that all treatment
of cancer which was to be effective, and not merely palliative, must be
carried to all parts of the body by means of the blood stream. He therefore
introduced the use of intravenous injections in the experimental therapy of
rat and mouse tumors. An accidental observation led him to believe that
selenium was a substance possessing a high degree of affinity for tumor cells.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="500"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a></span></p>
<p>In order to insure the penetration of the tumor in the live animal by this
substance, however, he considered it essential to combine it with some other
highly diffusible substance. This type of substance, which was to act as a
carrier of the selenium, he described under the name “cytotrochin,” from the
Greek word τροχιά {trochia}, meaning road. For this purpose he selected eosin. The
eosin and the selenium were then combined by a method and in a form the
details of which have never been published. All that we know of this preparation
is contained in the statement that it is very difficult to produce, and that it is
extremely unstable and difficult to keep. Mice can be given amounts of from
2 to 3&nbsp;mg. of this substance in solution. Wassermann experimented with mice
inoculated with transplanted tumors of the types of carcinoma and sarcoma.
After from three to five intravenous injections of the drug, he noted that the
tumors become softer and fluctuate. After still further injections the fluid
mass undergoes absorption, and the tumor gives the impression of an empty
sac. If it is possible to carry the injections up to the number of ten or twelve,
recovery ensues. In such cured animals there remain only the unabsorbed
portions of the fibrous capsule. Recurrences were not observed in the cured
animals. Wassermann further stated that two spontaneous tumors in mice
which had been treated by this method presented favorable results.</p>

<p>Wassermann’s original presentation gave few experimental details, and has
not been followed by the promised scientific report. From his article it is
impossible to determine what proportion of his animals were cured and
what proportion failed to survive the treatment. From a later paper by
<span class="nowrap">Keysser<a name="FNanchor_270_288" id="FNanchor_270_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_288" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> we learn that by far the larger portion of the animals perished during
the treatment in the stage of softening, so that a cure was accomplished in
from only 3 to 5 per cent. of the animals. This is a point of great importance,
inasmuch as it furnishes an indication of the highly dangerous character of
this mode of treatment. Fatal results are attributed by Keysser to the
absorption of toxic products from the tumor. This contention, however, is
supported by no observations, and it is certainly equally fair to assume that
death results from the toxic effects of the compound. A microscopic study of
tumors taken from animals undergoing treatment was made by Hansemann.
He found that the death of the cells was the result of nuclear destruction.</p>

<p>Within a very few months after Wassermann’s publication, Neuberg and
<span class="nowrap">Caspari<a href="#Footnote_268_286" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> published a paper which was the first of a series of studies on the
therapeutic effects of the heavy metals on the animal tumors. They used zinc,
platinum, tin, selenium, copper, silver and cobalt in the form of certain complex
organic compounds, the composition of which is not revealed. Owing to
the fact that intravenous injections of these compounds produced a specific
effect on the tumors, they are described as “tumoraffin” substances. Immediately
after the intravenous injection of these preparations, there followed a
marked hyperemia of the tumor, whereas the remainder of the mouse’s body
appeared markedly anemic. The hyperemia was often attended by hemorrhage
into the tumor. This first stage was succeeded by liquefaction and absorption
followed by recovery in favorable cases. The authors failed to state in what
proportion of their experiments the animals died, and in what proportion
recovery ensued.</p>

<p>The second paper on this subject is by Neuberg, Caspari and Löhe<span class="nowrap">,<a href="#Footnote_268_286" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> in
which further details are vouchsafed. They state that with the compounds
used by them the toxic and the therapeutic doses approximate very closely,
from which it follows that the treatment, as with the Wassermann method,
results in a very high mortality. Smaller doses produce no therapeutic effect;
on the contrary, they seem to act as a stimulus to the tumor, accelerating the
normal rate of growth. Spontaneous tumors show similar effects, but no cures
are recorded. Only in tumors in which autolysis is active <i>intra vitam</i> does the
<span class="pagenum" title="501"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a></span>method exert any effect. Consequently the benign primary tumors of animals,
such as fibromas, are not influenced by it.</p>

<p>Neuberg and Caspari are to a great extent responsible for the colloidal
theory of treatment in tumors. Accepting the observations of Petri and others
that the autolytic ferments in tumors are quantitatively greater and qualitatively
different from those present in the normal tissues of the body, they venture
the assumption that the process of recovery in the experimental tumors of
animals is due to the self-digestion of the tumor by these ferments. Ascoli
and <span class="nowrap">Izar<a name="FNanchor_271_289" id="FNanchor_271_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_289" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> had shown that such ferments are materially stimulated by the
presence of metals, and more especially of metals in colloidal form. This
contention is apparently in harmony with the well-established fact that certain
colloidal metals of themselves are capable of acting under certain circumstances
as ferments. Neuberg and Caspari were at first of the belief that the
compounds produced by them circulate in colloidal form. Subsequently they
stated that these compounds were crystalline substances, but they assumed,
under the influence of the theoretical consideration mentioned above, that
these substances are broken up in the tumor and there undergo transformation
into the colloid state.</p>

<p>In connection with the preceding observations there are certain other experimental
results which require mention. <span class="nowrap">Izar<a href="#Footnote_271_289" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> succeeded in curing rat tumors
by means of injection of colloidal sulphur. C. <span class="nowrap">Lewin<a name="FNanchor_272_290" id="FNanchor_272_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_290" class="fnanchor">272</a></span> cured subcutaneous
mouse tumors with various preparations of gold. Werner and <span class="nowrap">Szécsi<a name="FNanchor_273_291" id="FNanchor_273_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_291" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> produced
similar results through a combination of selenium-vanadium with cholin-borate;
in these experiments the selenium-vanadium was supposed to be
present in colloidal form.</p>

<p>Within a comparatively brief period of time, therefore, it fell to the lot of
a number of observers, using strikingly different substances, to produce therapeutic
effects amounting in a certain percentage of cases even to cure in the
experimental tumors of the lower animals. The various procedures have little
in common. Both metals and nonmetallic substances have been employed
either in colloidal form or in combination with organic radicals. In some
instances a diffusible carrier is combined with the basic substances; in others
not. All of the preparations appear to possess a high degree of toxicity,
although adequate data on this very essential feature are almost invariably
withheld.</p>

<p>Wassermann’s results with eosin-selenium were soon critically examined by
other observers. <span class="nowrap">Uhlenhuth<a name="FNanchor_274_292" id="FNanchor_274_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_292" class="fnanchor">274</a></span> and <span class="nowrap">Contamin<a name="FNanchor_275_293" id="FNanchor_275_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_293" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> were unable to confirm his
observations, but their negative results are attributed by Keysser to the fact
that they were not in possession of the proper formula for the preparation of
the eosin-selenium compounds as used by Wassermann. Apolant<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_276_294" id="FNanchor_276_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_294" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> however,
in Ehrlich’s name confirmed Wassermann’s findings.</p>

<p>The most important critique of eosin-selenium has been contributed by
the subsequent investigations of one of Wassermann’s original collaborators,
F. Keysser<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_277_295" id="FNanchor_277_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_295" class="fnanchor">277</a></span> Keysser’s publication contains a large number of very careful
observations on the various forms of eosin supplied by the German manufacturers,
as well as on other matters which cannot here be considered in
detail. He finally reached the conclusion that the eosin furnished by the
manufacturing house of Sandoz was the most effective for his purposes, inasmuch
<span class="pagenum" title="502"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a></span>as it combined the lowest grade of toxicity with the highest capacity for
discoloring the tissues. The selenium he used in the form of selenio-vanadium
furnished by Clin of Paris, which was the identical preparation used by
Werner and Szécsi in combination with borcholin. The maximum dose of this
selenio-vanadium is 0.06&nbsp;c.c. for each gram of mouse. Eosin, 0.01&nbsp;gm., dissolved
in 0.5&nbsp;c.c. of physiologic salt solution, is mixed with 0.5&nbsp;c.c. of the
selenio-vanadium. This mixture is then used for intravenous injections. The
results produced by the injection of this mixture are to all intents and purposes
similar to those obtained by Wassermann, except that Keysser induced
cure in a larger proportion of animals, namely, from 6 to 8 per cent. It is
evident from his careful description of his experiments that the treatment is
extremely toxic to the animals. The therapeutic dose is considerably greater
than one-half the toxic dose. This accounts for the fact that an extremely
large proportion of the animals perish during the course of the treatment.
The tumors failed to be influenced unless the dose given fell very little short
of the fatal amount. Moreover, in order to accomplish a complete cure, at
least eight to ten injections must be given, and in some instances not less than
fourteen.</p>

<p>Keysser’s most important conclusions, however, were obtained by following
an altogether different line of procedure. It has been pointed out by Carl <span class="nowrap">Lewin<a href="#Footnote_272_290" class="fnanchor">272</a></span>
that the therapeutic results obtained from subcutaneous mouse tumors, however
encouraging, could not be logically applied to the treatment of human cancers.
The subcutaneous transplanted tumors, as is well known, are as a rule
limited by a distinct capsule and show no tendency to infiltrative growth. In
this particular they present a most striking difference when compared with
human tumors. On the other hand, the metastases of mouse tumors in the
internal organs present an infiltrative mode of growth and thus approximate
very much more closely to the human type of tumors. Keysser, therefore,
determined to test the therapeutic effectiveness of his compounds on tumors
implanted in various organs. He developed a technic which enabled him to
implant tumors in the liver, the spleen, the kidneys and other parts of the
mouse by means of injection through special needles, often without the
assistance of a cutting operation.</p>

<p>The tumors so implanted grew rapidly, and within from two to three
weeks reached the size of cherry pits. The growth was character­is­tic­ally
infiltrative. Animals with these tumors were then submitted to intravenous
injection of the therapeutic agents in exactly the same fashion as the animals
carrying subcutaneous tumors. The results, however, were absolutely different.
Whereas the subcutaneous tumors invariably showed a much more intense
discoloration than the other tissues of the mouse, this feature was entirely
lacking in the case of the internal tumors. Softening and liquefaction, which
almost invariably follows on the third or fourth injection in the case of
subcutaneous tumors, and which is the first symptom of cure, never presented
itself in the case of the internal tumors. Their consistency throughout the
treatment was indistinguishable from that of the tumors of control animals.
The treatment, in fact, appeared to exercise not the slightest influence on
internal tumors. There was neither cessation nor retardation in growth, but
the tumors continued their normal rate of destructive increase with the
production of metastases, leading eventually to the death of the animal either
during the course of the treatment or shortly thereafter. Microscopic changes,
such as had been observed by Hansemann in the case of subcutaneous tumors,
were entirely lacking. No matter in what organ the tumors were implanted,
these results remained the same. No matter what type of tumor was employed,
whether carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or sarcoma, the therapeutic outcome was
regularly and consistently nil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="503"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a></span></p>
<p>These results induced Keysser to determine whether or not eosin-selenium
could actually be shown to exercise a deleterious effect on cancer cells outside
the body. In order to do this he made a suspension of mouse tumor cells in
salt solution and mixed this with the eosin-selenium-vanadium, using the
latter in amounts equivalent to three times the fatal dose for a mouse. After
the mixture had stood from one to three hours, it was injected either subcutaneously
or intravenously into mice in order to test the vitality of the cells.
In every instance the injections resulted in the production of tumors which
could be in no way distinguished from the tumors produced by untreated
cancer cells. In other words, the therapeutic preparation had absolutely no
effect on the tumor cells.</p>

<p>In the same way Keysser carried out experiments along the lines inaugurated
by Neuberg, using a combination of glycocoll and copper. He also tested the
combination of borcholin with selenium-vanadium used by Werner and Szécsi.
He was able to confirm the fact that both of these substances produced an
unmistakable therapeutic effect on subcutaneous tumors. On the other hand,
they were absolutely without influence on the internal tumors. In this respect,
therefore, they were entirely comparable with the eosin-selenium compound.
The theoretical basis constructed by Neuberg, which rests on the assumption
that the metallic compounds stimulate autolytic processes in the tumors, was
also subjected by Keysser to destructive criticism.</p>

<p>Finally, Keysser showed that none of these therapeutic agents were effective
even in the case of subcutaneous tumors, unless the latter had reached at least
the size of cherry pits. If a therapeutic injection were made immediately after
inoculation of the tumors, no effect was observed. The tumors grew exactly as
in the control animals, and the injected animals died in about the same period
of time as they.</p>

<p>All of these facts, which taken together constitute a very remarkable and
convincing piece of scientific investigation, permit of but one conclusion. It
is quite clearly established that none of the preparations of which the therapeutic
effectiveness has hitherto been proclaimed exercise any direct influence
on the life or development of the tumor. Under certain very definite and
restricted conditions, however, they do appear to produce certain changes in
the tumors, and in a small proportion even cures. These results, however, are
obtained only in the case of tumors which are subcutaneous in location and not
smaller than a cherry pit in size. Keysser’s interpretation of the striking
differences between tumors is of interest in this connection. He believes that
the constant palpation and examination of the subcutaneous tumors, which is
prompted by interest in the experiment, produces circulatory changes with
hyperemia and hemorrhage. These circulatory changes are responsible for
the increased tendency of the injected substances to lodge in the tumors,
thereby possibly increasing the tendency to autolysis which the circulatory
changes have inaugurated. It is, of course, questionable whether this explanation
can be regarded as final. In a series of experiments which I performed
many years ago, I was able to show that sodium iodid when injected intravenously
accumulates in tumors in larger amounts than in any other tissue of
the body in rats. A similar observation has been recorded by Wells, De Witt
and Corper<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_278_296" id="FNanchor_278_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_296" class="fnanchor">278</a></span> In the same way I found that various dyes, such as Congo
red, when injected intravenously, could be demonstrated in tumors long after
the rest of the body had recovered its normal color; the liver alone vied with
the tumors in this respect. The dyestuff was invariably sharply localized in
the necrotic portions of the tumor. The conclusion seemed obvious that, owing
to circulatory conditions or possibly even to chemical conditions, the dye was
retained longest in the necrotic parts of the tumor. This effect was unquestionably
<span class="pagenum" title="504"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a></span>not due to handling, inasmuch as the animals in my experiments were
not palpated from the time of injection until death.</p>

<p>I have, however, had an even more striking demonstration of the same
fact. I have given intravenous injections of dyes to patients suffering with
various forms of internal tumors, as, for example, cancer of the breast, in the
hope of favorably influencing the growths. At operation, the picture presented
by the tumor is striking in the extreme. It presents areas of various size
which are intensely discolored by the dye. These areas, both to the naked
eye and under the microscope, are the necrotic parts of the tumor. The
actively growing areas of tumor tissue and all the normal tissues of the organ
present their normal color. All of these observations lead to the conclusion
that the necrotic areas in tumors either possess a higher affinity for sodium
iodid and for the dyes than do the normal tissues, or that these substances are
more slowly absorbed from the necrotic areas owing to the circulatory deficiency.
Whichever of these explanations is accepted, it is quite reasonable to believe
that necrotic areas might well undergo liquefaction under the influence of
the various substances which have been used for therapeutic injection. Such a
result is, of course, without direct effect on the growth or vitality of the living
part of the tumor. This fact is quite clearly evidenced by the experimental
data, which show that the internal portions of the tumor might undergo liquefaction
and yet the tumors were not cured. Indeed, Löhe, who made microscopic
examinations of the tumors treated by Caspari and Neuberg, states particularly,
with reference to a tumor which had been subjected to treatment, that “the
central portion of the tumor showed softening, while the external margin was
composed of actively growing cells.” The central portions of implanted
tumors are, of course, those which first undergo spontaneous necrosis.</p>

<p>It still remains to explain the small percentage of cures achieved by
Wassermann and by Keysser. It does not appear to me that this problem
presents any insuperable difficulties. The fact must be emphasized that
practically 95 per cent. of the animals die under the treatment, which sufficiently
indicates the toxic effects of the agent used. We must remember that
transplanted tumors are under all circumstances at a certain disadvantage as
compared with the normal tissues of the body. After all, they are implanted
on a foreign soil. Their blood supply is impoverished and imperfect. They
have a natural tendency to undergo necrosis, and in many cases spontaneous
retrogression. It is not strange, therefore, that they should prove in slight
degree more susceptible to toxic effects than are the normal tissues of the
body.</p>

<p>If we remember that the various therapeutic agents introduced in all probability
reach a somewhat higher degree of concentration in the necrotic areas
of the tumor than in the normal tissues of the body, an assumption which is
entirely in accord with the facts as observed in the case of sodium iodid and of
various dyes, we may be quite prepared to believe that this factor is sufficient
to induce the destruction of the marginal healthy and living cells of the
tumor. The fact that small subcutaneous tumors were found by Keysser to be
entirely refractory to the treatment is entirely in accord with this assumption,
in view of the fact that tumors of this size present practically no central
necrosis. The same explanation holds of the observation previously cited
from Caspari that the primary spontaneous tumors of animals do not yield to
the treatment. Indeed, he himself states that the treatment is effective only
in tumors in which autolysis takes place during life. The word autolysis,
however, in this connection is a misnomer and represents a gratuitous assumption;
as an actual fact, one is entitled to say only that such tumors undergo
central necrosis, in all probably owing to defective circulatory supply. The
process is exactly similar to the coagulation necrosis described in the case of
<span class="pagenum" title="505"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a></span>tubercles by Weigert. If autolysis occurs, it is only secondary to the preceding
necrosis.</p>

<p>This explanation, however, is confronted by the fact that the internal tumors
produced by Keysser showed no tendency to effect a localization of the dyes,
and correspondingly no tendency to be affected by the therapeutic agents. One
might be permitted to inquire whether these internal tumors had undergone any
necrosis. Keysser unfortunately makes no mention of this matter. It is certainly
true that the infiltrative mode of growth of the internal tumors, which
is entirely different from that of the subcutaneous implantations, is associated
with a much better blood supply and a lessened tendency to undergo necrosis.
That such tumors can undergo necrosis, however, is evidenced by certain illustrations
given by Carl Lewin in his paper on internal tumors. But such
changes usually occur only in advanced stages. To judge from his plates,
Keysser worked with relatively small tumors, an assumption which is rendered
even more likely by the fact that his injections were undertaken in a fairly
early stage of their growth. In this connection I may quote certain experiments
of my own on internal tumors<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_279_297" id="FNanchor_279_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_297" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> The implantations made in my experiments
were produced by intravenous injections of a tumor suspension into the
jugular vein of rats. Such injections resulted almost invariably in the production
of a large number of tumors in the lungs, which, as is well shown in the
figures accompanying the original article, differed very markedly in size. The
smaller of these tumors are composed throughout of actively growing cells,
while the large tumors present an area of central necrosis exactly as do the
subcutaneous tumors. If such an animal be given an intravenous injection of
a dye such as Congo red, it will be found that the larger tumors present an
area of central discoloration corresponding to the area of previous necrosis,
while the smaller tumors, like normal tissues, are not colored. Thus, it is
clear that the internal tumors implanted in animals are subject to the same
laws concerning the distribution of dyes and, of course, other substances as
are the subcutaneous tumors. As I have stated previously, an exactly analogous
observation has been made in a human breast tumor. In the absence of any
contradictory evidence, therefore, I think that it is perfectly justifiable to
assume that Keysser failed to achieve a result in the internal growths simply
owing to the fact that those growths presented practically no areas of necrosis
at the time of his injection.</p>

<p>Another theoretical question which bears closely on the recent therapeutic
investigations in human beings concerns the rôle of colloids, as such, in the procedure.
It is quite clear from what has already been said that all experiments
with animal tumors have been largely influenced by the belief that metals in
the colloidal form exercise a peculiar and characteristic influence on the
destruction of tumors. Even when the therapeutic agents have been introduced
in crystalline form, as by Neuberg and Caspari, the authors find themselves
compelled to assume that the metals are reduced to colloidal form
within the tumors. For the latter assumption there is absolutely no evidence;
it is due simply to the influence of the colloidal theory. If one critically
examines the data on which this theory is based, one is forced to the conclusion
that it has practically no established claim to validity. If we grant that
colloidal metals have been shown to stimulate autolysis in the test tube, the
same fact must be admitted of metals in noncolloidal solution. The experiments,
however, are very far from establishing either of these facts satisfactorily.
But even were this the case, it is an unjustifiable inference that living
tumor cells would be influenced in anything like the same manner as are the
dead cells observed in test tube experiments. As an actual fact, we know
from the work of Evans and Schulemann that only the “scavenger cells” of the
body take up foreign colloids, and to this class the tumor cells do not belong.
<span class="pagenum" title="506"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a></span>Moreover, the form in which metals are introduced into the circulation is not
necessarily or even probably the form in which they act on the tissues. Colloidal
solutions of the metals are certainly subject to precipitation and other changes
on entering the blood. This fact I have shown experimentally in a previous
study on colloidal copper<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_280_298" id="FNanchor_280_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_298" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> In the same way it is probable, as has been
pointed out by Wells, that metals when introduced in crystalloid form may
rapidly be altered so that they are carried throughout the body in colloidal
form. All of these considerations indicate how unjustifiable is the assumption
that colloidal metals exercise a peculiar action on growing tumors. It is
hardly surprising that their empiric use has failed to measure up to expectations
based on so slim a foundation of fact.</p>


<h5>CLINICAL OBSERVATION</h5>

<p>Clinicians have not been slow in following the lead suggested by the therapeutic
experiments in animals. It is perfectly proper that this should be the
case. In dealing with a disease of the character of cancer, in many instances
entirely beyond our power to influence, no one can question the advisability
of trying any and every agent which holds out the slightest promise. Unfortunately,
a closer analysis of the animal experiments fails to vindicate even that
degree of faith. When one considers the facts which have been analyzed in
the preceding discussion, it would appear not only futile but actually dangerous
to attempt to benefit cancer sufferers by means of any of the agencies which
have been employed in animal experimentation. Nevertheless, the fact
remains that a variety of preparations have been used in the human clinic.
The various types of preparations may be satisfactorily grouped under four
classes, namely:</p>

<p class="ml1em">1. The crystalline salts of selenium.<br />

2. Selenium in colloidal solution.<br />

3. Other metals in colloidal solution.<br />

4. Compounds of metals with organic radicals.</p>

<p>These substances have been administered by injection or by the mouth. In
the case of injection, the injections have been made either into the subcutaneous
tissues, intramuscularly, or intravenously, or finally, directly into the tumors.
Before passing to a further consideration of this subject in detail, it may be
well to recall the fact that in the experimental tumors of animals, no matter
what preparation has been used, it has been possible to accomplish therapeutic
effects only by the use of relatively enormous doses of the medicament, of
doses, in fact, which were scarcely lower than the lethal dose. Certain experimenters
have noted that smaller doses actually stimulated the growth of the
tumors. In the second place, it has almost invariably been found necessary to
administer the treatment intravenously, inasmuch as the other modes of
administration failed of therapeutic effect. It is quite apparent that a procedure
in human beings in any degree analogous to that pursued in animals is
entirely impossible. The doses used, with one notable exception to be subsequently
mentioned, have invariably been relatively small. Hence it is apparent
at the outset that at least one fundamental condition of success in the treatment
of animal tumors has been necessarily excluded in the clinical application.</p>

<p>The salt used by Wassermann is not stated in his original publication.
<span class="nowrap">Wolff<a name="FNanchor_281_299" id="FNanchor_281_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_299" class="fnanchor">281</a></span> speaks of it as a sodium salt, whereas Keysser says that it was a combination
with potassium cyanid. In only one instance, as far as I am aware,
has the sodium salt been used thera­peutically in human beings. <span class="nowrap">Delbet<a name="FNanchor_282_300" id="FNanchor_282_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_300" class="fnanchor">282</a></span> states
<span class="pagenum" title="507"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a></span>that he employed this salt intravenously in one case, and that its use was
shortly followed by death. Unquestionably the salts of selenium are very
much too toxic to be used in this way.</p>

<p>The majority of those who have worked with selenium have used it in
colloidal form, either preparing it themselves or employing one of the preparations
put on the market by the pharmaceutic firms. Of the latter the best
known are the electro-selenium of Clin, and the Seleniol of Couturieux. Of
those who have made use of selenium in these forms may be mentioned Cade
and Girard<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_283_301" id="FNanchor_283_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_301" class="fnanchor">283</a></span> Bougeaut and Galliot<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_284_302" id="FNanchor_284_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_302" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> Blumenthal<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_285_303" id="FNanchor_285_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_303" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> Thiroloix and Lancien<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_286_304" id="FNanchor_286_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_304" class="fnanchor">286</a></span>
Delbet, Laurent and Bohec<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_287_305" id="FNanchor_287_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_305" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> and most extensively of all, M. Touche<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_288_306" id="FNanchor_288_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_306" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> All of
these authors have described cases of malignant new growths of the most varied
character which were treated by these preparations.</p>

<p>The results obtained are fairly concordant. The intravenous injection of
the preparation produces but slight disturbance. There is leukocytosis, a moderate
rise of temperature, and not infrequently a chill. Otherwise the substance
seems to possess no toxicity. The effects produced on the tumors have almost
invariably been described as encouraging. Touche, who treated twenty-seven
cases in this way and has described each case in detail, states that under the
treatment the surface of the tumors, if ulcerated, became cleaner and healthier;
the tumors became softer; the rate of growth was arrested, and there was
relief of pain and of the accompanying functional disturbances; often, too,
there was a gain in weight and an improvement in general well-being.</p>

<p>Touche concludes his article with the statement that “it is certain that the
effect is not curative but it is actually palliative.” Delbet, on the other hand,
states that he has seen no beneficial effects from the use of colloidal selenium
injected intravenously. In the discussion on Delbet’s paper, Ledoux-Lebard
states that he has observed nothing from selenium further than the temporary
improvement which is shown by almost all cancer cases on the application of
any new therapeutic measure. In one or two instances the claim is made in
the literature of an actual cure of malignant growth through the use of
selenium. Such, for example, is the case described by Blumenthal. From the
clinical description this might have been a cancer of the tongue, and was
judged to have been such in view of the negative Wassermann reaction. No
microscopic examination was made. Arsphenamin was given. The patient
recovered. It is clear that instances of this type cannot be accepted as beyond
criticism, and it is safe to say that nothing more convincing in the way of
actual cure is offered in the rather voluminous literature on the use of selenium.</p>

<p>Numerous compounds of selenium, some of them claiming to circulate in
colloidal form, have been described, and have been put on the market for use
in malignant disease. Such are Walker’s sulpho-selene, and selenio-vanadium,
which has been prepared in the form of an ointment by Schering and Glatz.
These preparations lay claim to the same palliative effects which have been
previously described for colloidal selenium.</p>

<p>Of the other metals in colloidal form, chiefly silver and copper have come
into use. Colloidal silver was first recommended for malignant growths by
Vogel. It is obtainable on the market in proprietary form under the name of
fulmargin, and also as electrargol. Recently <span class="nowrap">Rohdenburg<a name="FNanchor_289_307" id="FNanchor_289_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_307" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> has made a careful
study of the effects of colloidal silver in experimental and in human tumors,
and finds that they have no value. Colloidal copper has been used in recent
<span class="pagenum" title="508"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a></span>times for the same purpose by Gaube du Gers and by others. I have recently
examined the effects of colloidal copper on malignant tumors in man, and have
been unable to find that it has any therapeutic value. Furthermore, a study
of the distribution of the copper in tumors obtained at operation or by necropsy
from individuals so treated failed to show that the copper had been deposited
therein.</p>

<p>Finally, preparations similar to those used by Werner and by Caspari in
animals have also been used in human beings. In these cases also the authors
have been able to record palliative effects on the tumor, but in no instance
cures.</p>

<p>We have seen that it has been quite impossible to duplicate in human
beings the therapeutic technic employed in animal experiments. We have seen
further that the use of a modified technic in animal experimentation has never
been productive of favorable results even at the hands of enthusiastic adherents.
In striking contrast to these conclusions are the observations made in
human therapeutics. For every type of preparation described in the preceding
paragraphs, the claim has been made practically without exception that it
exercises a markedly beneficial effect on malignant diseases in the human being.
Not only are the subjective symptoms alleviated, but also the tumors appear
to become cleaner and softer; the rate of growth is retarded; necrosis and
metastasis are prevented, and inoperable tumors become operable. How are
we to interpret these observations? How are we to explain the fact that they
are the almost invariable accompaniment of the most diverse methods of treatment?
I have already quoted the statement of Ledoux-Lebard that every
therapeutic novelty appears to exercise a favorable effect on cancer cases. The
same fact has been observed in a variety of other diseases, such as locomotor
ataxia.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a safe and reliable estimate as to the value of any
new or experimental procedure in cases of cancer, it seems advisable to accept
certain definite therapeutic criteria by which the cases are to be judged. In
the absence of such a method, alterations in symptoms which are actually of
no real value or importance receive undue emphasis. The natural course of
the disease is associated with such fluctuations that a sanguine therapeutist
can gain some encouragement from even the most hopeless cases. Hence it
follows that every mode of treatment has found adherents. The market is
flooded with cancer drugs, and cancer charlatans flourish in the most highly
educated communities. Unfortunately, even well trained, honest and reputable
physicians have fallen victims to this fallacy, and have lent their names to the
support of modes of treatment which in reality produce no determinable effect
on the natural evolution of the disease. It was the desire to combat this unfortunate
tendency which led me some time ago to attempt to establish a reliable
set of criteria of therapeutic effects in cancer. These were embodied in an
<span class="nowrap">article<a href="#Footnote_280_298" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> which appeared two years ago, and I may be here permitted to quote
them in extenso:</p>


<h5>CRITERIA OF THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In determining the effects of any given mode of treatment on a tumor, a
variety of criteria may be relied on. Circulatory changes in the tumor, the
relief of pain and the restoration of a secondarily impaired function are certain
of the criteria on which stress has been laid by the majority of observers in
the past. Important as are these criteria in determining the progress of purely
inflammatory processes, it is unquestionable that their value in judging of the
effects of therapeutic methods when applied to malignant disease is open to
criticism. It is a curious and interesting fact that almost every therapeutic
claim made in recent years in connection with cancer has included among its
virtues the relief of pain. This is true of vaccination with cancer tissue, of
Hodenpyl’s method and of many others. In view of this very general effect,
<span class="pagenum" title="509"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a></span>not much stress can be laid on this symptom, and it is probably fair to assume
that in the great majority of these cases the result is in no small measure
psychic. The improvement of function is also largely a subjective phenomenon,
and as such requires most careful criticism. Osler relates that he has known
a patient with gastric cancer to be relieved of digestive disturbances and to
gain 18 pounds in weight as the result simply of the visit of a sanguine consultant
who denied the presence of a tumor. Improvement in the ability to
chew food, to articulate words or to move a limb are phenomena familiar to
those who attempt to treat cases of cancer. The victims of this disease seem
to be in a very high degree “suggestible” and impressionable and respond nobly
to every therapeutic effort.</p>

<p>Circulatory changes in tumors offer an interesting group of clinical symptoms.
The observation has often been made, especially in ulcerated new
growths, that treatment is associated with swelling, peripheral hyperemia, and
an altered character of the discharge. In spite of the fact that there is no
reasonable relationship between this congeries of symptoms and the actual cure
of the tumor, they generally receive considerable emphasis and are cited as
an indication of the specific local action of the agent employed. It is also true,
however, that the growth may continue to advance in spite of their presence.
It is of some importance to inquire into the mechanism which produces these
circulatory changes and into their clinical interpretation. It is a well known
fact that many drugs, when introduced into the body either by the mouth or
through the skin, are excreted not only by the normal channels of elimination,
such as the kidney or the intestine, but also from such ulcerated surfaces as
may be present on the body. This is easily shown to be true, for example,
of certain of the anilin dyes, which, when introduced by way of the veins, produce
an intense discoloration of the dressings over ulcers. It is likewise true
of certain of the metals, such as arsenic. In order to understand the series of
events previously enumerated it is therefore only necessary to assume that the
therapeutic agent is excreted from the ulcerated surface of tumors. If an
irritant, it will tend to produce hyperemia of the margins of the ulcer, and an
increase of the secretions. If an astringent, however, it may produce just the
opposite of these effects. Such a result, however striking, is purely accidental,
and has no necessary bearing on the growth or destruction of the tumor itself.
It constitutes a symptom on which no reliance should be placed.</p>

<p>Excluding from consideration all of these secondary factors, we may conclude
that the observation of the size of the tumor itself is the sole criterion
on which we can place reliance in judging of the effect of therapeutic measures.
This implies, in the first place, that a tumor must be accessible to fairly accurate
measurement. Tumors of the uterus, for example, and intra-abdominal
growths will only exceptionally fall into this class. In the second place, indirect
evidence of a decrease in the size of tumors, such as is afforded by the
increased permeability of obstructed passages, as in the case of tumors of the
esophagus, pylorus or intestine, must be accepted only with great reserve.
Remissions in the obstructive symptoms characteristic of such tumors are a
frequent feature of the normal evolution of the clinical history of such growths.
The relief of obstruction, however, may be due either to necrosis of the obstructing
portions of the tumor, while the remainder continues to grow progressively,
or to a relief of the accompanying muscular spasm. Finally, evidence of decrease
afforded by the roentgenogram is not sufficiently exact in most cases to afford
ground for so important a conclusion as that at present in question.</p>

<p>Not only must there be unquestionable evidence, however, of the diminution
in size of the tumor, but this diminution must be of a kind not ordinarily
attributable to the natural evolution of the tumor<span class="ell">...</span>. It is safe to say
that multiple tumors offer enormous difficulties in the matter of interpreting
therapeutic results. At present we have in the wards of the hospital a patient
with multiple metastatic carcinomas of the skin. For several months we have
at intervals made accurate measurements of certain of these tumors and have
found that some have undergone retrogression, others have entirely disappeared,
while still others have continued to grow steadily. In the case which
afforded the ascitic fluid used in Hodenpyl’s experiments, many of the lymphatic
<span class="pagenum" title="510"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a></span>metastases underwent complete retrogression, while the metastatic process in
the liver, as was demonstrated at necropsy, increased progressively, and ultimately
almost destroyed that organ. Thus, in multiple carcinosis, the retrogression
of individual nodules is no indication that therapeutic intervention has
produced an improvement.</p>

<p>I shall not delay to emphasize those variations in the size of solid tumors
which accompany hemorrhage and its absorption, edematous swelling, necrosis
in the depths, and other familiar factors which clinically simulate, or induce, the
softening and the reduction that are so often attributed to therapeutic interference.
But it is important to draw attention to a similar feature in that
type of superficial epithelioma known as rodent ulcer. These new growths not
infrequently advance at one point of the periphery, while they recede at
another, and thus cicatrization and contracture may simulate a partial recovery.
This effect is due in part to alterations not in the growth itself, but in the
accompanying ulcerative process. The secretions from the growths, especially
if confined under dressings, may have eroded and destroyed the surrounding
skin, and it is tempting to interpret a recession of the associated ulcerative
disease as an indication of a favorable effect on the new growth. It is unquestionably
this aspect of rodent ulcers which plays so generously into the hands
of the numerous venders of nostrums for this disease.</p>

<p><i>In brief, the demonstrable reduction in size of a tumor, of a kind not to be
attributed to the natural processes of evolution of that tumor or of its associated
lesions, is the one essential feature of effective therapeutic intervention.</i></p></div>

<p>When the various methods of treatment which have been discussed in this
paper are judged by the standard advocated above, it is apparent that none of
them can lay claim to therapeutic effectiveness. The modifications of the
disease attributed to them are modifications which occur spontaneously in a
very large proportion of cases as a result of the natural evolution of the
disease process. This is a fact which cannot be too strongly emphasized.
Owing unfortunately to the hopeless character of cancer, men are not prone
to study with care all the lesser changes which the disease and the patient
present under ordinary conditions; but when a “cure” is under investigation,
the patient and his medical attendant note every apparent improvement with
painstaking attention and enthusiasm. As a result, some evidence of improvement
in treatment is entered on the books.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>THE DIRECT SALES COMPANY</h3>


<p>During the past four or five years, <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has had inquiries similar
in effect to this, just received from Dr. E.&nbsp;P. Jewett of Gardner, Mass.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Will you kindly inform me regarding a drug manufacturing company by the name of the
Direct Sales Company, Buffalo, New York? Are their products standard and reliable
so far as you know?”</p></div>

<p>The Direct Sales Company, Inc., Buffalo, has, according to its letterhead,
the following officers:</p>

<p class="ml1em fs85">
<span class="smcap">Geo. J. Dotterweich</span>, President and Treasurer,<br />
<span class="smcap">C.&nbsp;K. Dotterweich</span>, Vice-President,<br />
<span class="smcap">Louis B. Seufert</span>, Secretary.<br />
</p>

<p>This concern circularizes physicians and emphasizes that it sells “Only by
Mail.” It also features a “profit sharing rebate” scheme, whereby purchasers
receive a coupon representing 10 per cent. of the invoice value of each purchase.
After $100 worth of merchandise has been purchased the $10 worth of
coupons when “presented for redemption at one time” will be “honored as cash”&mdash;presumably
on the purchase of additional goods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="511"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a></span></p>
<p>The Direct Sales Company catalogues have for some years, carried a guaranty,
which reads, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We absolutely guarantee all preparations to be in exact accordance with the National
Pure Food and Drugs Act, June 30, 1906.</p>

<p>“We also absolutely guarantee all preparations bearing our label to be equal, if not
superior, to any on the market.”</p></div>

<p>In one of the Quarterly Bulletins of the State Board of Health of New
Hampshire, issued last year, this paragraph appeared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Direct Sales Company, Inc., Buffalo, N.Y., is a pharmaceutical concern which until
recently has done business direct with New Hampshire physicians. In two or three instances
complaints have been received by this department that the preparations sold seemed to be
lacking in potency. Some time ago a physician sent us a specimen of codein sulphate tablets,
one-fourth grain, concerning which he was suspicious, admission being made that the price
paid was very much less than current quotations. The amount of codein sulphate actually
found per tablet proved to be but one-sixteenth grain. Later on, having subsequently received
a new lot from this source, the same physician sent us a second sample, the composition of
which was found to be practically identical with the first. Acting under the federal law,
500 lot packages of the following preparations were next purchased of the company direct,
the analytical results indicating serious deficiency in every case, as follows:</p>

<p class="ml1em">“Tablets salicylic acid, 5 grains <span class="ell">..</span>. 1.72 grains found.<br />

“Tablets acetyl­salicylic acid, 5 grains <span class="ell">..</span>. 2.31 grains found.<br />

“Tablets acetanilid, 3 grains <span class="ell">..</span>. 1.88 grains found.<br />

“Tablets codein sulphate, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain <span class="ell">..</span>. <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>15</sub></span> grain found.<br />

“Tablets nux and pepsin No. 2, claiming pepsin 1 grain, extract nux vomica, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub></span> grain,
found to have a gross average weight per tablet of only 1.17 grains, 0.54 grains of which
was represented by sugar and other medicinally inert material.<br />

“Tablets Infant’s Anodyne (Waugh) showed serious discrepancy from formula.”</p></div>

<p>The Bulletin added the statement that, as the company could not be reached
under the New Hampshire laws, the federal authorities were appealed to. The
result of this appeal appeared in <i>Chemical Supplement 54</i>, issued Aug. 21, 1918,
by the Bureau of Chemistry of the U.&nbsp;S. Department of Agriculture. This
government bulletin contained Notice of Judgment No. 6193, which describes
cases of adulteration and misbranding of some of the drugs put out by the
Direct Sales Company. Briefly, it may be said that some 2 grain acetanilid
tablets sold by this concern were found by the government chemists to contain,
roughly, about 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> (1.61) grains; some <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></span> grain calomel tablets were found to
contain only about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub></span> (0.163) grain; some 1 grain quinin sulphate tablets
were found to have only about <span class="nowrap"><sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> (0.63) grain; some 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> grain salol tablets
contained only about 1<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub></span> (1.39) grain; some 5 grain sodium salicylate tablets
contained less than half that amount (2.32 grain). In addition, the federal
chemists found that some Elixir of Iron pyrophosphate Quinin and Strychnin
(<i>Elix. Ferr. Pyrophos. Quin. et Strych. N.&nbsp;F.</i>) fell considerably below the
standard of strength laid down by the National Formulary by having less than
one-eighth the amount of quinin sulphate which the official standard calls for,
and only about one-fifth the amount of sugar, saccharine, which is not a normal
ingredient of the official preparation, having been substituted for part of the
sugar. The chemists found, too, that some hydriodic acid sold by the same
concern, instead of containing, as the label declared and as the United States
Pharmacopeia requires, 1 per cent. of absolute hydriodic acid, contained less than
one half of 1 per cent. The Direct Sales Company pleaded guilty in this case
and was fined $700.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 27, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>DISCOVERIES AND DISCOVERERS</h3>

<p>In spite of the wonderful achievements of modern science, it seems impossible
to get the public to think in scientific terms. This is doubtless due to
a fundamental weakness in our educational system. The tendency still is to
<span class="pagenum" title="512"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a></span>think in terms of the eighteenth century rather than of the twentieth. Many
times <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has been chided, even by its friends, for failing to take
seriously preposterous claims made for alleged discoveries in medicine by
well-meaning but self-deluded enthusiasts or by shrewd and conscienceless
charlatans. Far too often the attitude is that any alleged discovery in medicine,
no matter how bizarre or how humanly improbable, should be taken up in
all seriousness and subjected to the tests of modern laboratory methods. It
was only a few years ago that a quack of unsavory antecedents brought forth
an alleged cure for consumption&mdash;a disease that for years has been the subject
of study by the best brains in the world&mdash;and a medical college spent
thousands of dollars “investigating” the “cure,” thereby giving it a standing
that it would never have received otherwise and incidentally obtaining for
the school an amount of publicity that may or may not have been desired. As
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> said at the time, it would have been just as pertinent for a
body of astronomers to determine by scientific methods whether or not the
moon is really made of green cheese.</p>

<p>The point we would make is that the strides made by modern science have
practically eliminated the possibility of men without training or special knowledge
evolving any epoch-making discovery. In this connection an editorial in
the <i>Scientific American</i> of recent date, dealing with the mechanical sciences
rather than the medical, is well worth quoting in part. The editorial discussed
the “Garabed” incident. “Garabed,” as Our readers know, was a name given
to a device which one Garabed T.&nbsp;K. Giragossian claimed to have developed
and which, so far as could be learned from the generalities in which Mr.
Giragossian indulged, would take energy out of the cosmos and transfer it
directly into mechanical motion. Mr. Giragossian would give no details
regarding his “engine,” but was so able to hypnotize Congress into a belief that
he had something worth looking into that it passed a joint resolution calling
for the appointment of five scientists to pass on the claims for Garabed. The
investigation proved, as might have been expected, that the thing was unsound
in principle and nonoperative as a device.</p>

<p>The methods by which Garabed was brought before the public savored
strongly of those used by quacks in the medical world, the one difference being
that Giragossian was apparently perfectly sincere and unequivocally honest.
The point that we bring out, however, and which, as we have said before, was
so well expressed by the <i>Scientific American</i>, is the utter futility of wasting
the time of scientific men on alleged inventions or discoveries by men without
training who substitute secrecy and glittering generalities for facts and
accomplishments. Quoting the <i>Scientific American</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scientific discovery, once an open field for all comers, is today becoming more and more
a matter calling for the most intensive special qualifications. As the body of human knowledge
broadens and deepens, it becomes increasingly difficult to make any material addition to
it. Any one undertaking such a task must of necessity bring to it a long and careful training,
acquired either in the refined atmosphere of the laboratory, or in the rougher school of close
contact with the operation of apparatus constructed by those who have already qualified. In
particular, he must possess a carefully developed power of making accurate observations
and drawing correct conclusions. It is rather the habit to point to men like Edison and
Maxim in refutation of these necessities; but they are not to be so refuted. These men are
examples, raised to the <i>n</i>th power, of the great inventor who has qualified in the University
of Hard Knocks and Long Experience.</p>

<p>On these grounds, when a man comes before us in the self-assigned rôle of a great
inventor, it is incumbent upon him to answer, not necessarily the bald question “Who are
you?” but certainly the more searching one, “What are your qualifications to undertake this
work?” Only by his answer can we decide whether he possesses a competence deserving of
attention, or is but a dilettante playing with fire. Yet this obligation was one which Mr.
Giragossian, far from meeting, did not even appear to comprehend. To every effort to
ascertain his qualifications he replied in the same terms, that he was an honest man, and
could prove it by letters from his technically nondescript collection of friends and sponsors.
The very fact that more than personal integrity is necessary in a man who would unravel
the secrets of the creation of energy appears to have escaped his comprehension.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="513"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a></span></p>
<p>The fundamentals thus stated apply with equal force to the sphere of
medical discovery. At the time when medicine was pure empiricism it was not
only possible but also probable that the medicinal value of certain products
or combinations of products might be stumbled on by those untrained and
unskilled. That time has passed. Today, while it is not impossible, it is so
improbable that there is no justification in taking up the time of scientific men
in investigating alleged discoveries by men who are utterly lacking in the
fundamental qualifications needed for the study of the complex problems of
human pathology.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 10, 1918.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>“DRUG REFORM”</h3>

<h4>As It Appears to the Cleveland Medical Journal</h4>


<p>The matter which follows appeared originally as an editorial in the
<i>Cleveland Medical Journal</i>, November, 1915. It expresses, we believe, the
attitude of the thinking physician toward the subject discussed:</p>

<p>Physicians have come to the realization that drugs are as a two-edged
sword&mdash;under proper conditions, striking against the disease; otherwise, against
the patient’s health. The first condition for their proper use is adequate knowledge
of their composition and purity; of their actions and malefactions; their
field and limitations. Slowly and painstakingly&mdash;sometimes painfully&mdash;this
scientific knowledge has been gathered, is still being gathered, by chemists
and pharmacists, pharmacologists and clinicians, with increasing thoroughness,
care and discrimination.</p>

<p>Where wisdom fears to venture, unwisdom and cupidity find ample room.
The wise physician knows that there are ills that drugs cannot cure; that drugs
generally only aid or relieve; and that to obtain even this aid efficiently and
safely, the existing scientific knowledge is none too great. Not so the unwise.
He who sees in disease only a name, to him a name is a sufficient cure. Let
there be a mixture with a convenient and suggestive name and a pleasant taste,
a compendious index of diseases and symptoms&mdash;and a lively imagination&mdash;and
the cure is accomplished. Few things could be easier, and few more false.
It is not surprising that the “man on the street” should fall into these errors;
it is sad that any physician should be misled by the sophistry of interested drug
vendors.</p>

<p>Physicians have the moral obligation to instruct the public in matters of
health. Preaching before practice is of little avail. It behooves the medical
profession to make at least a reasonable effort to clean its own house before
it passes the broom to the public. Realizing this responsibility, the American
Medical Association some years ago established its Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry. This Council is strictly an educational agency&mdash;it collects and
disseminates knowledge about drugs, especially those drugs that are advertised
to physicians and that are not described in the legal pharmacopeias. Physicians
are thus put in a position to discriminate. Many have done so; others
will, a few may never see the light on this earth.</p>

<p>Journals can no longer claim that they mislead their readers in good faith.
Some&mdash;the <i>Cleveland Medical Journal</i> among the first&mdash;have frankly acknowledged
their obligations, and sacrificed a lucrative income from advertisements;
others are still occupied in compounding the matter with their conscience. Manufacturers
are in a similar position. Those who are on the side of scientific
progress&mdash;or to put it materially, those who realize that honesty is the best
policy&mdash;are taking the opportunity to separate themselves from the dishonest
and ignorant.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="514"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a></span></p>
<p>Altogether, the medical profession may safely advise the public on the
subject of drugs without laying itself open to the charge that it preaches what
it is unwilling to practice.</p>

<p>Meantime, the public itself has had a somewhat similar awakening. The
progress of the profession has necessarily spread more or less to the laymen.
All sorts of educational agencies have been working to convince the public
that individual and national health is too precious an asset to be entrusted to
any quack who may spell his praise in printer’s ink. Legislators have passed
food, drug, and antinarcotic laws which have aroused interest and discussion.
Even the “drugless cults” have somewhat offset their harm by causing the
public to reflect that drugging is not a panacea for all ills. All this has not
been without effect. The public is in a receptive mood; it is not convinced,
but wishes to learn. Legislators are prepared to follow public opinion. The
purveyors of patent medicines are watching events.</p>

<p>What, under these conditions, should be the attitude of the medical profession?
Plainly, it should continue to be what it always has been: to stand
aggressively for the protection of the public health, without any compromise.
In doing so, it is true, physicians will expose themselves to the imputation of
selfish motives. Selfishly commercial minds cannot or will not understand the
unselfish ideals of a profession&mdash;that is their loss. Physicians, however, must
be careful not to give a semblance of reason to the charge; for that would
diminish the effect of their attitude. They must confine themselves to informing
the public of the facts; and to guarding the health of the public at large, and
of their own patients in particular.</p>

<p>No one, in a free country, can force a diseased individual to seek effective
treatment or prevent him from using an ineffective treatment, unless his disease
imperils the health of others. At that point, and not before, the government can
and should take personal measures. However, it is a well recognized function
of the government to protect individuals against their own ignorance. It does
this when it forces the child to go to school; it does this when it places the
swindler in jail.</p>

<p>On exactly the same principle, the government has the right and the duty
to protect the uninformed public against the flagrant evil of the patent medicine
traffic&mdash;and the patent medicine traffic as now carried on is a flagrant evil and
series of evils. The government should protect the public against advertisements
that are framed to suggest or create imaginary ailments, with their
attendant miseries; it should protect the public against being deluded by false
promises of cure; against the specious relief that merely hides the disease
and blinds the patient to its dangers; against drugs that may and do work
positive harm; against the veil of mystery that makes these abuses possible.</p>

<p>The individual layman cannot protect himself against these dangers, and
has a right to expect that the government will prohibit the indiscriminate sale
of any medicine that may be harmful to him. He has a right to expect, when
the government permits the sale of a patent medicine, that the medicine will
do him no harm; just as he has a right to expect that any physician whom the
government permits to practice, should be competent.</p>

<p>These are some of the reasons why physicians oppose patent medicines as
they are now exploited; and for these reasons, physicians should take an
absolutely uncompromising attitude, and use every opportunity to educate the
public. The patent medicine interests naturally try to obscure the issue. By
the art in which they are so skilful, they aim to suggest to the public that
physicians are opposed to patent medicines, in order to drive patients to their
offices. They “forget” to mention that physicians have never conducted a “campaign”
against really efficient preventive public-health measures, no matter how
<span class="pagenum" title="515"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a></span>many prospective patients were involved. No physician has ever refused to
give diphtheria antitoxin because this would diminish the number of his visits.
A short memory is a very convenient asset for self-interested persons. It is
not so convenient for the public&mdash;but it is all too frequent. Physicians must,
therefore, make it plain that their stand is not against patent medicines, but
for the protection of the health of the public.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
March 4, 1916.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>DRUG THERAPY: THE FALLIBILITY OF TEXTBOOKS</h3>


<p>Until very recently, we were compelled to acknowledge that little, if any,
progress was being made in internal medicine so far as drug therapy was
concerned. Everybody knows of the progress made in other branches&mdash;in
bacteriology, in pathology, in biologic chemistry, in surgery, in etiology and
in application of technical methods to diagnosis. Recently, however, pharmacologic
research and the application of scientific methods in the study of
the physiologic action of drugs are resulting in definite, positive progress. An
important lesson, incidentally learned through this scientific investigation, is
the fallibility of the drug therapy described in textbooks. The explanation is,
of course, that many of these textbooks are mere compilations containing false
statements, unproved theories, and unverified clinical evidence representing
the guesswork of ancient uncritical observers. Many drugs have been, and
still are, vaunted in textbooks as valuable in a variety of conditions, whereas
scientific investigation and controlled clinical observation have proved them
to be totally worthless; others are proving to be of value in an extremely
limited number of conditions. The sooner writers of textbooks realize this
fact and enter into the spirit of the new era, the better for the public and for
scientific medicine.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 27, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>THOMAS WEBSTER EDGAR</h3>

<h4>Tired Rabbits for Diabetes; Ring-Tailed Monkeys for Sex Stimulation</h4>


<p>During the last two or three years <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has received inquiries
regarding one Thomas Webster Edgar, M.D., of New York City, first, relative
to his alleged treatment for diabetes and more recently about his “monkey
gland” treatment for sex stimulation. Here is one from a physician in
Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have you any knowledge of the efficacy of a serum made from the pancreas of rabbits
for the relief or cure of diabetes? It is made by Dr. T.&nbsp;W. Edgar of 766 West End Ave.,
New York City.”</p></div>

<p>And this from a layman in Pennsylvania:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Last year there was published in the <i>New York</i> Herald an account of the new treatment
for diabetes in which a serum was injected in the veins and as a result it was claimed that
over sixty-five per cent. of the treatments made were successful. The account further stated
that they proposed to establish some sort of a sanitarium in New York City used especially
for the treatment. The writer having mislaid the account, wrote the <i>New York Herald</i> as to
the doctor who had charge of it and in return was given the name and address. Dr. Edgar
in a letter under date of last year stated that the cost of the treatment was $300.00, payable
beginning of the treatment, and he gave very little information as to the success of it, with
the exception that if the treatment did not give the desired effect after the end of three months,
it would be continued without any further cost. The writer wrote and asked him the names
of one or two of the patients who had been cured, because it seemed rather unusual that if
the treatment were a success, it was necessary for a patient to pay the cost of the treatment
in advance. To that letter I have never received a reply.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="516"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a></span></p>
<p>While a physician from Illinois writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am enclosing a clipping from a Chicago paper relative to Dr. Thomas Webster Edgar
of New York and his operation for transplanting the glands of ring-tailed monkey. I note
that he is a member of the New York County Medical Society! What is there to this? I
have seen no mention of these wonders in <i>The Journal</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Thomas Webster Edgar was born in 1889. The records show that he was
graduated in medicine by the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College
in 1913, and was licensed to practice medicine in the State of New York
the same year. In March, 1919, an article by T. Webster Edgar appeared in the
<i>New York Medical Journal</i> on “Diabetes Mellitus.” In this Edgar gave a
theory of the cause of diabetes mellitus and stated that he had “treated successfully,
twenty cases of definite diabetes.” In the article he spoke positively of the
successful results he had obtained by the “intramuscular injections of my
diabetic serum.” No information was given regarding this serum except that
he mentioned vaguely that it was “prepared from normal blood after the
animal is exercised to the point of fatigue.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/516.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (reduced) of a few of the newspaper items that appeared in
various parts of the country regarding Thomas Webster Edgar’s alleged serum for diabetes.</div>
</div>

<p>A few days after the appearance of this article in the <i>New York Medical
Journal</i>, newspaper articles appeared regarding a cure for diabetes perfected by
“Dr. Thomas Webster Edgar, 766 West End Avenue, New York City.” According
to these reports, Edgar said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I tried the blood of rabbits and found what I wanted. In obtaining the blood I first put
the rabbit upon a treadmill and keep it there until it reaches a stage of fatigue. Then I draw
the blood, and after heating it to 60 degrees centigrade separate the corpuscles from the
serum. When the serum has been treated after the method I have discovered, I inject it
immediately subcutaneously.</p>

<p>“I have attained success in 65 per cent. of my cases and I have had 100 cases. I do not
say that the cure is infallible, but I am now certain that it will work in most cases, particularly
when the patient observes the rules laid down and undergoes faithful treatment.”</p></div>

<p>In April, 1919, a physician in Kansas wrote to Edgar at the request of a
diabetic patient asking for information about the “serum.” Edgar replied that
it would be impossible to send the physician any of the serum for administration
unless the “patient is willing to pay me for the cost of same, which will
be approximately the sum of $25.” He stated further that, in a few months’
time, he hoped to be able to manufacture the serum in larger quantities which
would “more than cut the expense in half.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="517"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a></span></p>
<p>In the same month a layman in Chicago who read the newspaper story
wrote to Edgar and asked for details regarding terms and the arrangements
that would have to be made to take the “treatment.” Edgar replied that he
expected to be in Chicago in a few weeks’ time and would see the man in
consultation with his regular physician, that he would administer the first
injection and give instructions to the physician as to subsequent injections.
Edgar added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My custom is to have all fees paid in advance and my charge is
$200.00 by certified cheque or money-order.”</p></div>

<p>A layman in one of the smaller cities of New York wrote to Edgar in May,
1919, and received a reply from Edgar’s secretary stating that the treatment
extends “over a period of three months, cost $150.” He was also told that the
serum could be sent to his physician for administration “for the sum of
$25 prepaid by money-order.” The letter closed with the statement that Edgar
“has been very successful with the serum.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/517.jpg" width="485" height="281" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (greatly reduced) of small portion of the publicity that has
been given to Edgar relative to his operation for “sex stimulation” by the transplantation of
the glands of ring-tailed monkeys!</div>
</div>

<p>A layman in South Carolina who wrote to Edgar in June, 1919, was told
that the treatment as administered by Edgar “extends over a period of two
months; fee $300” and that if he wanted the serum administered by his own
physician the cost would be “$50 prepaid.”</p>

<p>In May, 1920, Edgar had another article on diabetes, also in the <i>New York
Medical Journal</i>. In this, too, he refers to his serum in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In conclusion I may state that I have been able to produce some rather startling results
by the use of my serum, which is prepared from the blood of rabbits after they have undergone
a series of maneuvres capable of activating the various internal secretory glands to
increased action. The serum contains the internal secretions in hormone form.”</p></div>

<p>Gradually the newspaper publicity on Edgar’s diabetic “serum” died down.
Then, in November, 1920, there appeared&mdash;again in the <i>New York Medical
Journal</i>&mdash;an article by Edgar on “Sterility, Sex Stimulation and Endocrines.”
Edgar there stated that he wished to place himself “on record as being interested
in sex stimulation” and that he wanted to notify the profession that he
<span class="pagenum" title="518"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a></span>had another serum which he was using “with success in the treatment of this
condition.” Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. I feel entitled to state that I have a distinctly beneficial serum for the alleviation
of presenile and senile deficiency; and that my product is capable of producing a new
lease of life in those whose functions have been reduced to a minimum.”</p></div>

<p>How long Edgar has been featuring his “serum” for “sex stimulation” it is
difficult to determine, but during the last year the newspapers have carried
sporadic reports of alleged remarkable results produced by “Dr. Thomas Webster
Edgar of 766 West End Ave., New York,” through the transplantation of
the “interstitial gland” taken from “a special species of orangoutang.” A layman
who wrote Edgar some months ago regarding this “gland implantation”
received a letter from Edgar’s secretary stating that the treatment “has been
most successful in all cases” and assuring him that “the experimental stage had
been passed, and the operation is advised in all cases presenting symptoms of
presenility or age.” A week later the same man received a letter written by
Edgar himself in which he reiterated the claim that all of the operations had
been successful. Edgar added that he was now treating all cases “by operation
instead of the serum,” and that “the fee for operation is $500, inclusive of the
sanitarium,” the patients remaining in the “sanitarium” “for from two to three
days.” A month or two later the prospective patient received another letter
signed, “Thomas Webster Edgar, M.D.,” assuring him that “the effect is permanent,
and does not wear off. No ill effects can possibly result.”</p>

<p>Commencing, Oct. 1, 1921, a series of sensational articles appeared regarding
one of Edgar’s alleged monkey gland implantations performed on an individual
described as “one time lawyer and then a writer.” These articles purport to be
written partly by one of the newspaper staff, partly by the man undergoing the
“operation” and at least one by Thomas Webster Edgar. The material is
played up in the style typical of yellow journalism. In addition to repeated
pictures of the individual who is being operated on, there also are given pictures
of Thomas Webster Edgar and one of his “ring-tailed monkeys.” Doubtless
the “story” has sold many newspapers. Its sensational character, the element
of mystery and above all its sex slant will appeal to that large class of newspaper
readers that hunger for stuff of this sort. Doubtless, too, it has proved
a large advertising asset for Thomas Webster Edgar.</p>

<p>The statement that appears in the series to the effect that Edgar “is a member
of the County Medical Society of New York” is incorrect. Edgar is not
a member.</p>

<p>The further newspaper claim that Edgar is “an authority on glandular
transplantation” should also be accepted with reservations. “Authorities” are
created with ease in the pages of newspapers. Edgar may possibly be termed
an authority in a newspaper or, shall we say, Pickwickian sense.&mdash;(<i>From The

<h4>The Journal Receives a Letter Denouncing “Medical Clerks” and
“Biased Sceptres”</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> recently published in this department some inquiries regarding
Thomas Webster Edgar, M.D., of New York City, relative to some alleged
serums that Dr. Edgar had developed for diabetes and sex stimulation,
respectively, and relative also to the newspaper publicity given Dr. Edgar in
connection with the alleged transplantation of glands from “ring-tailed
monkeys.”</p>

<p>We are in receipt of a letter signed, “Thomas Webster Edgar, M.D.,” and
reading as follows. It is given <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Gentlemen</i>:&mdash;I have read with great interest your editorial regarding the publicity given
my work in metabolism, and gland implantation.</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="519"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a></span>
<p>“Your <ins title="Transcriber’s note: probably should be ‘pseudo-exposé’">pseudo, expose,</ins> and distinctly libelous insinuations are unjust, and they lead me
to believe that you are going to be called to account at a very early date.</p>

<p>“My profession is the practice of medicine, and the policy of my practice is not controlled
by the editorial department of the journal. I am progressive, and a firm believer that
legitiment medicine and surgery can not be practiced if the physician be governed by a set
of medical clerks, who disdainfully boast that they control, and govern the healing art
through out the breadth of the land, with a sceptre that is biased and steeped in the
unadulterated commercialism of a certain medical clique.</p>

<p>“Aside from the fact that I am an associate editor on a medical publication, it is
disgraceful, as well as unjust that you have written such an editorial with out first investigating
the therapeutic value of my serum, and implantation operation.</p>

<p>“The psychology of your editorial, only reflects on your editorial department, and will
tend to belittle some of the greatest surgeons in the country.</p>

<p>“It may be to your advantage to know, that this very afternoon, I was on the program
with the following men.</p>

<p class="ml3em">
“Dr. Lewis Gregory Cole&mdash;New York<br />
“Dr. Charles H. Mayo&mdash;Rochester, Minn.<br />
“Dr. John B. Deaver&mdash;Philadelphia<br />
“Dr. Charles Peck&mdash;New York.<br />
</p>

<p>“My paper was entitled&mdash;Senility, its etiology and treatment by gland implantation. I
am sure the above mentioned gentlemen are thoroughly ashamed of your actions in the matter,
as well as thoroughly disgusted with the baby like attitude you have displayed. You have
no sense of fair play, and if it is with in my power to undue the wrong which you have
wrought me, I shall endeavor to vindicate myself in the eyes of the clear thinking members of
the profession.</p>

<p>“I sincerely trust you will publish this communication, in order that my brethren shall
understand and appreciate that your thrust has not gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>“It is my hope that the various medical societies through out the country, will call upon
me to read a paper on my work, so that I may be able to offer substantial evidence to the
fact that you have done me an injustice.</p>

<p class="tac">“Very truly yours,</p>

<p><span class="l-inline2"><span class="lowercase smcap">TWE/AEL</span></span><span class="r-inline2">[Signed] “<span class="smcap">Thomas Webster Edgar, M.D.</span>”</span></p></div>

<p>Dr. Edgar’s statement that he had been on the program with Drs. Cole, Mayo,
Deaver and Peck was sufficiently startling to prompt further investigation. It
was found that the program in question was that of the annual meeting of the
New York and New England Association of Railway Surgeons. It was further
found that Edgar’s name did appear on some of the printed programs but not
on others. It was rather naturally assumed that the name had been put on the
program before the officers of this organization had seen the crude publicity
to which <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> recently called attention. It was found, however, that
after several hundred programs had been printed about 150 more were needed
and “in the meantime, Dr. Edgar had come into the limelight” in his ring-tailed
monkey gland transplantation rôle and “was invited to read a paper
on the subject.” While he accepted this invitation the secretary of the organization
tells us that Edgar did not read his paper but, when the paper was called,
declined, saying it was time for him to be in his office!</p>

<p>As for the rest of Dr. Edgar’s communication, <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> appreciates that
courtesy is due “an associate editor on a medical publication”&mdash;referring
doubtless to the <i>Western Medical Times</i>. Dr. Edgar’s pronouncement that
“legitimate medicine and surgery can not be practiced if the physician be governed
by a set of medical clerks” seems reasonable&mdash;if cryptic. But it is when
he charges that these “clerks” govern the healing art “with a sceptre that is
biased and steeped in the unadulterated commercialism of a certain medical
clique,” that he really shines. Whatever opinion one may hold of Dr. Edgar’s
ability to compound serums, surely no one can question his skill as a mixer
of metaphors. His reference to “sceptres” deserves to be embalmed in every
textbook on rhetoric with the classic of the Hibernian statesman who passionately
declared: “I smell a rat! I see it floating in the air! But, mark you, Sir,
I shall nip it in the bud!”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 3, 1921.</i>)</p>

<hr class="r16" />

<h3>GLYCEROPHOSPHATES</h3>


<p>Physicians who prescribe on definite principles must often be puzzled by
the number and variety of glycero­phosphates on the market. All available
evidence indicates that, as sources of phosphorus to the animal organism, the
glycero­phosphates possess no advantages over the ordinary inorganic phosphates<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_290_308" id="FNanchor_290_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_308" class="fnanchor">290</a></span>
The glycero­phosphates are split up in the intestine, and liberate inorganic
phosphates. In this form they are absorbed and utilized, if they are
utilized at all. There is no evidence that glycero­phosphates have any pharmacologic
action to warrant the belief that they are of use as therapeutic
agents. The theory that organic phosphorus compounds are more readily
assimilable than inorganic compounds and hence a better means of introducing
phosphorus into the system is still kept alive in the promotion of certain proprietary
mixtures, in spite of the scientific evidence that the organism can
assimilate phosphorus quite as readily from inorganic as from organic phosphorus
compounds<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_291_309" id="FNanchor_291_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_309" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> The glycero­phosphates will continue to be manufactured
until physicians refuse to prescribe them. A chemist in the “research laboratory”
of a well known manufacturing firm has recently given a rather interesting
reason for the use of glycero­phosphates&mdash;from the manufacturers’ point of
view. He is quoted as saying: “On account of the instability of phosphorus in
elixir of phosphorus, nux vomica and damiana we have quite recently replaced
the phosphorus by glycero­phosphates. Such a preparation is apparently equally
as effective, for we continue to have a great demand for it.” This is doubtless
a sufficient reason for the substitution from the manufacturers’ point of view;
but how about the patient, who, after all, is the one to be considered? Is it
not a matter of considerable importance to the patient whether he receives
phosphorus, one of the most powerful drugs known, or the inert glycero­phosphates?
The chemist’s statement seems to imply that it is not. It may be of
interest to recall that a member of the firm whose chemist gives this “reason”
for the use of glycero­phosphates, in a recent address, was rather severe in his
condemnation of institutions of learning, hospitals, etc., for their lack of
cooperation with manufacturers: he said that “they should welcome an opportunity
to let any manufacturer try out or test his products in their clinics,
laboratories, etc.” A test as to whether there is a difference between the action of
glycero­phosphates and ordinary poisonous yellow phosphorus, especially when
the former are mixed with extracts of nux vomica and damiana, would not
be likely to appeal to many hospitals and laboratories as a very promising
field of research at this day since, as has been stated, the scientific evidence at
present available does not furnish any warrant for the therapeutic use of
glycero­phosphates.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 15, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>INFLUENZA VACCINES</h3>


<p>With the appearance of the epidemic of influenza, reports began to appear,
chiefly in newspapers, as to new serums, vaccines, drugs and other methods for
checking and even for curing the disease. A few samples of such as have
come to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> appear in our Tonics and Sedatives Department this
week. In Massachusetts, Commissioner E.&nbsp;R. Kelly appointed two committees
to investigate the value of influenza vaccines as a preventive agent and
as a treatment of the disease. The first committee, a special board for scientific
investigation, consisting of Dr. M.&nbsp;J. Rosenau, chairman, and Frederick P. Gay
and George W. McCoy, was appointed to consider the evidence available on
<span class="pagenum" title="521"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521"></a></span>the prophylactic and therapeutic use of vaccines against influenza. This committee
presented the following conclusions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The evidence at hand affords no trustworthy basis for regarding prophylactic vaccination
against influenza as of value in preventing the spread of the disease, or of reducing its
severity. The evidence from the present epidemic, though meager, suggests that the incidence
of the disease among the vaccinated is smaller than among the nonvaccinated. The board,
therefore, concludes that further experimental evidence should be collected.</p>

<p>2. The evidence at hand convinces the board that the vaccines we have considered have
no specific value in the treatment of influenza.</p>

<p>3. There is evidence that no unfavorable results have followed the use of the vaccines.</p></div>

<p>The second committee, known as the Special Board of Statistical Investigation,
consisted of Dr. George C. Whipple, chairman, William H. Davis and
F.&nbsp;C. Crum. This committee reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The weight of such statistical evidence as we have been able to accumulate indicates
that the use of the influenza vaccine which we have investigated is without therapeutic benefit.
Exceptional cases where apparent benefit has resulted from the use of the vaccine can be
matched by other cases where similar recoveries have been made without vaccination.</p>

<p>2. The statistical evidence, as far as it goes, indicates a probability that the use of this
influenza vaccine has some prophylactic value.</p>

<p>3. There is also some evidence to the effect that other methods of protection, such as
open-air treatment and the use of proper masks, are effective in protecting exposed
attendants, and the use of vaccine should not be taken as an excuse for omitting such
safeguards.</p></div>

<p>As a result, the following recommendations were made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the state encourage the distribution of influenza vaccine intended for prophylactic
use, but in such manner as will secure scientific evidence of the possible value of the agent.
The use of such vaccine is to be regarded as experimental.</p>

<p>That the state shall neither furnish nor endorse any vaccine at present in use for the
treatment of influenza.</p></div>

<p>These reports are conservative, and offer to other health commissioners and
their communities a reliable guide as to procedures that should be adopted
before subjecting or trying out on the public any method of prevention or
treatment that may be offered. These matters are the domain of medical
science, and medical scientists of recognized ability should be called on to
make the decision.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 19, 1918.</i>)</p>


<h4>Serums and Vaccines</h4>

<p>With respect to serums and vaccines in influenza, there are certain simple
facts and considerations that physicians will do well to keep in mind at this
times. The main point to keep always in sight is that unfortunately we as yet
have no specific serum or other specific means for the cure of influenza, and
no specific vaccine or vaccines for its prevention. Such is the fact, all claims
and propagandist statements in the newspapers and elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding. This being the case, efforts at treatment and prevention by
serums and vaccines, now hurriedly undertaken, are simply experiments in a
new field, and the true value of the results cannot be predicted by any one.
Indeed, the exact results can be determined if at all only after a time, in most
cases probably not until the epidemic is past and all the returns fully canvassed.
Consequently, the physician must keep his head level and not allow himself to
be led into making more promises than the facts warrant. This warning
applies especially to health officers in their public relations.</p>

<p>As to serum treatment, the only noteworthy new method so far is the
injection in severe cases of influenzal pneumonia of the serum of patients who
have recovered from such pneumonia<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_292_310" id="FNanchor_292_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_310" class="fnanchor">292</a></span> The principle of this method is rational;
<span class="pagenum" title="522"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a></span>analogous procedures have given seemingly good results in scarlet fever and
other diseases; and the results reported in influenzal pneumonia appear
promising. Further trial of this treatment under proper conditions consequently
seems to be warranted. It should be borne in mind, however, that
McGuire and <span class="nowrap">Redden<a href="#Footnote_292_310" class="fnanchor">292</a></span> made their observations in the declining phase of the
epidemic when the organism or organisms concerned appeared to be losing
virulence. For this and other reasons, the expectations as to what may be
accomplished by this method must be kept within reasonable bounds.
Influenza is a self-limited disease with variable complications and of variable
severity in different places, thus offering great difficulties in the way of evaluation
of different methods of treatment.</p>

<p>At least two kinds of vaccine are in use in the hope that they may have
preventive effects. One consists solely of killed influenza bacilli; it being extensively
used in the East. We have as yet no decisive figures as to its effects,
but there is an impression that it may have some value. The other vaccine is
a mixed vaccine of the more important bacteria in the respiratory tract in
influenza, principally pneumonococci, streptococci and influenza bacilli. It
appears that vaccines of this nature are in extensive use, but we have no
evidence that any benefit will be derived from them. To say that thousands
have been vaccinated with apparently good results means nothing at all,
simply because we are still in the midst of the outbreak, in many places even
in the earlier stages. How slender the basis of this anti-influenzal vaccination
when it is considered that the real nature of influenza is still unknown!
In any event, it will require many carefully elaborated and controlled observations
before anything definite may be learned in regard to the effect of these
vaccines, and it is probably safe to say that nothing on which to rely in the
future can be learned from the indiscriminate vaccination now going on. There
is, therefore, no basis on which promise of protection from vaccines may be
made. They may be harmless, and they may or may not be of preventive
value.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 26, 1918.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>INTRAVENOUS THERAPY</h3>


<p>The intravenous administration of drugs is a new departure in therapy, but
one which is rapidly increasing in use. Among its reputed advantages are that
it is the quickest means of obtaining the effects of a drug, the effects are
obtained with a certainty not obtained by other methods, and they are so
marked that they cannot fail to impress the observer. These advantages in
many cases are apparent rather than real; but even were they real advantages,
they should not blind us to the various and serious dangers which this method
involves. The technic, although not difficult, must be thoroughly mastered, or
undue pain, infection, air embolism, or even death may result. Such accidents,
however, are ordinarily easily avoided, and should be considered quite inexcusable.
More serious is the fact that the drugs given intravenously reach the
system, and especially the heart, in a different manner and concentration from
that to which physicians are accustomed with ordinary methods of administration.
Pharmacologists have long practiced intravenous administration, when
studying acute effects of drugs, and they have observed that frequently the
immediate result of such injections is a prompt fall of blood pressure, not
obtained when the same drugs are given by mouth or even hypodermically.
This fall in blood pressure is commonly attributed to irritation of the endocardium.
It is usually of short duration, but is certainly undesirable and
sometimes may have serious results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="523"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a></span></p>

<p>It has also been observed that several drugs, for instance, quinin and
potassium, depress the cardiac muscle when given intravenously much more
than when given in other ways. Furthermore, any substance which tends to
precipitate proteins must be injected slowly and with extreme caution, or it
will produce intravascular clotting and sudden death. Deaths have resulted
not only from a lack of knowledge of the technic of intravenous therapy, but
also from a lack of knowledge of drugs which may be so administered. Sudden
death has been reported following the injection of an iron preparation containing
peptone, and also following intravenous injection of ether. Intravenous
injections, while sometimes superior to the slower methods, are distinctly
inferior when a continuous, rather than a sudden, action is desired. Drugs
leave the blood system with great rapidity, and therefore their action on the
circulation will cease promptly unless they are continuously supplied. It
would be undesirable to inject intravenously such drugs as iodids, nitrites,
iron or salicylates.</p>

<p>With these dangers and disadvantages in mind, it seems unwise to resort
to promiscuous intravenous medication until the effects of this method have
been studied in detail for the drugs employed, and unless there are distinct
advantages to be secured. This is the case when an immediate action is
necessary in emergencies, as in the use of strophanthin for cardiac collapse,
quinin in pernicious malaria, etc., or if the drug would be destroyed in the
stomach or tissues as in the case of salvarsan, or when the drug is not adequately
absorbed by any other channel, as in the case of epinephrin.</p>

<p>Intravenous therapy will be most securely advanced if its employment is
restricted to such well defined fields. These fields can be satisfactorily
determined only by a scientific pharmacologic study of the action of these
drugs when so administered in animals, as well as in man, under conditions
in which the results are carefully controlled. The intravenous method is an
impressive one, approaching in preparation almost to that which goes with
a surgical operation. The patient is usually interested and impressed by this
new, and to him, mysterious method. There is a psychic element in his reaction
to the injection which is not a factor in his reaction to the same drug when
given by mouth. The intravenous injection of a complex mixture would appear
to be particularly reprehensible. Little is known, as has been stated, of the
results to be expected from intravenous therapy, even with simple substances.
The use of complex mixtures will without doubt react against the proper use
of the method.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 11, 1916.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>IODIN FUMES</h3>


<p>One of the important factors connected with therapeutics as a science is
the method of administration of medicinal substances. Drugs may be given
by mouth, by hypodermic or intravenous injection, by inhalation, by inunction
or, less frequently, by the use of other entrances into the body. In
choosing a method, the physical characters of the substance to be administered
and the immediate effects of the substance on the body tissues with which it
may come in contact must be especially taken into consideration.</p>

<p>These factors apply particularly in the case of substances like iodin, arsenic,
mercury or the biologic products in which the mode of administration radically
modifies the action. For some time, manufacturers have urged substitutes for
tincture of iodin, claiming that their substitutes were free from the undesirable
properties of the tincture, and, at the same time, possessed special virtues which
the tincture could not possess. More recently, attention has been directed to
the administration of iodin in the form of vapor. The diffusing and penetrating
powers of gases have particularly attracted the attention of therapeutists,
<span class="pagenum" title="524"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524"></a></span>since by this method drugs may be applied to rather inaccessible
portions of the body, such as the lining of the lungs, the throat and the
mucous membranes of the genito-urinary tract. Furthermore, it has been
asserted that iodin in the form of fumes has increased combining powers,
and is thus far more potent in effect than iodin administered by any other
route. There do not seem to have been any adequate scientific investigations
of the subject, however, until the recently published results of Luckhardt and
his <span class="nowrap">collaborators<a name="FNanchor_293_311" id="FNanchor_293_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_311" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> at the University of Chicago. In their experiments, both
on man and on animals, accurately determined quantities of iodin were
vaporized in a special device, and the fumes applied to the skin. At the same
time, the tincture was applied to the skin of other persons as a control. Iodin
was also applied to the skin of dogs with hyperplastic thyroid glands; and the
effects on the gland, before and after administration, studied. Dogs were also
used to determine whether iodin fumes were absorbed from the lungs. As a
result of these investigations, which are reported in great detail, it was found
that iodin, when deposited on the skin in the form of fumes, is absorbed. More
iodin was recovered from the urine, following the application of the tincture,
than was recovered following the use of the fumes. This result is explained
by the authors on the ground that probably more iodin was actually applied,
and that the iodin so deposited was held in combination with the protein during
the process of coagulation of the latter by the alcohol of the tincture,
leading to a state of continuous absorption. It is probable, furthermore, that
the iodin deposited on the skin in the form of fumes is revaporized to some
extent by the heat of the body.</p>

<p>Most important were the effects of iodin administered intratracheally in
the forms of fumes. Iodin given in this way seems to be rapidly and completely
absorbed; but it was found that the administration of the fumes of iodin by
inhalation through the respiratory passages, even in small quantities, is
fraught with great danger. Such administration induces dyspnea; and when
it is given in large quantities, acute and fatal pulmonary edema ensues within
twenty-four hours. When respiratory disorders are present at the time of
administration, the fatal edema supervenes very quickly. Thus far, no device
designed to deliver fumes controls the dosage.</p>

<p>It is interesting to consider, as do the authors, the fact that the fumes of
iodin have the same effect as those of two other halogens, bromin and chlorin.
The results of these experiments with iodin fumes on the dog, as shown by
necropsy findings, are practically identical with those reported by military
surgeons as found in soldiers gassed with chlorin during the war.</p>

<p>The results of these researches are additional evidence as to how scientific
research may confirm or deny conclusions based on empiric therapeutic observations.
The work may well serve as a model for similar experiments, now being
made, on the therapeutic use, intravenously, of such substances as nonspecific
proteins or organic preparations of toxic drugs. The patient should at least
have the chance that is afford him by preliminary experiments, scientifically
performed on animals in the research laboratory.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal

<h3>ITALIAN PHYSICO-CHEMICAL COMPANY</h3>


<p>Many and various are the letters received by The Journal asking for
information about an alleged scientific organization in Italy styled <i>l’Académie
Physico-Chimique Italienne</i>. This Italian Physico-Chemical Academy is
operated from Palermo, Italy. Here is the scheme: Dr. John Doe, an American
<span class="pagenum" title="525"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a></span>physician receives an imposing-looking letter bearing the Palermo, Sicily,
postmark and addressed to “<i>Monsieur le Docteur John Doe, Médecin</i>.” On
opening the letter “<i>Monsieur le Docteur</i>” finds that the “Council” of <i>l’Académie
Physico-Chimique Italienne</i> has nominated him “Honorary Member of this
Academy” and furthermore has bestowed on him “a First Class Medal for
technical work and scientific merit.” All this, “in consideration of your many
dignities and great learning.” Dr. Doe is told that as soon as he will write
an acceptance of this honor “in conformity with Section 19 and 22 of the
Constitution” he will be sent “the Medal, Diploma and all the other documents
relating to the title accorded.” The joker in the scheme lies in the necessity
for Dr. John Doe “conforming” with “Section 19 and 22 of the Constitution.”
Here are the sections:</p>

<img src="images/525.jpg" width="375" height="402" alt="" />
<div>Reduced photographic reproduction of the stock letter sent to American physicians by the
Italian Physico-Chemical Academy. The “joker” lies in the requirement around which we
have drawn a line.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Sec. 19.</i>&mdash;The entrance fee to cover office and postal expenses, including postage of
diploma is 5 Dollars, and is payable once at the admission to the Academy by special bulletin
filled up, stamped and signed.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sec. 22.</i>&mdash;Those to whom medals are awarded and who wish to possess them must pay
for their coinage 10 Dollars as the Academy does not, at present, possess the necessary funds
for this purpose<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>In short the whole thing means that if Dr. Doe is willing to send $15 in
good American money he will receive in due time from the academy a “diploma”
and a gilt (not gold) medal.</p>

<p>About four years ago when the “Academy” seemed to be making a particularly
heavy bid for American dollars the member of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> staff in
<span class="pagenum" title="526"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a></span>charge of the Propaganda Department wrote to the “Academy,” on his personal
stationery, asking about the cost of membership in the “Academy” and
asking also for a copy of the “prospectus.” And that was all. In reply he
received a letter stating that “in consideration of” his “many dignities and
great learning” he had been nominated “an officer of this academy” and had
been awarded “<i>la médaille de première classe</i>” for humanitarian work and
scientific merit. In order to obtain these tokens of the “Academy’s” regard
it would be necessary to inform the “Academy” of acceptance “in conformity
with Section 19 and 22&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.” As the Propaganda Department did not consider
the diploma and gilt medal worth $15 even as exhibit for its museum of
fakes, the “Form of Acceptance” was not filled in and returned “in accordance
with Section 19 and 22.”</p>

the “Italian Physico-Chemical Academy.” Filling out this blank and sending it <i>with $15.00</i>
to the “Academy” will bring the gilt medal and “diploma.”</div>
</div>

<p>The leading spirits in the operation of this diploma and medal mill are D.
and G. Bandiera, who, so far as we can learn, are neither physicians nor
pharmacists nor have any scientific standing. The “Academy” has been

<h3>WHAT IS LIQUID PETROLATUM?</h3>


<p>The use of liquid petrolatum in chronic constipation, which has recently
become the vogue, has naturally been commercialized; as a result, also naturally,
claims of superiority of one brand over another have been made. Some
of these claims may have been well founded; others certainly are not. Some
have claimed superiority for those products made from Russian oil over those
made from American oils. As naphthene hydrocarbons predominate in Russian
crude petroleums, and paraffin hydrocarbons in many or most American crude
<span class="pagenum" title="527"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a></span>petroleums, it was assumed that the petrolatums derived from these sources
differed from one another in like manner. Both the naphthenes and the
paraffins are chemically inert; but some unexplained therapeutic superiority
has been assumed to reside in the naphthenes. Consequently, it has been
urged that the American liquid petrolatums should not be used internally.
So far these claims and counterclaims have been based on much theory and
little fact. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> publishes this week a contribution by Benjamin T.
Brooks, Senior Fellow in charge of petroleum investigations at Mellon Institute,
Pittsburgh. Brooks calls attention to the fact that Marcusson, in 1913,
pointed out that most of the so-called “mineral oils” used for therapeutic
purposes contain no paraffin hydrocarbons whatever; that they consist solely
of naphthenes and polynaphthenes. Brooks confirms this statement so far as
American liquid petrolatums are concerned. He states that many American
petroleums, such as most of those from the Gulf region, are like the Russian
in containing no paraffin; and that, in the case of those petroleums that do
contain it, the customary refinery method of removing paraffin is sufficient to
produce true naphthene and polynaphthene petrolatums. “The claim that only
Russian oils belong in this class,” he says, “has no basis in fact and has been
advanced presumably for business reasons.” The name “paraffin oil” applied
to these liquid petrolatums, then, is a misnomer. The new name, “white
naphthene oils,” suggested by Brooks, seems superfluous, however, since the
pharmacopeial title, “liquid petrolatum,” is subject to no such objection.&mdash;(<i>Editorial

<h3>THE LOWENTHAL POSTGRADUATE COURSE</h3>

<h4>Which Tells How to Make Diagnoses Accurately, Scientifically Check the
Christian Scientists and Increase Your Earning Power</h4>


<p>During the past year <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has received letters from physicians in
various cities asking for information regarding the “Post Graduate Course of
Lectures and Clinics on Nervous and Mental Diseases” which was going to
be given in their respective cities by Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal of Chicago. The
following inquiries are typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>To the Editor.</i>&mdash;Please note the enclosed letter from the American Organotherapy Company
which appears to be conducted by Lowenthal. The proposition of conducting these
clinics impresses me as a piece of colossal gall which is amazing even in these days. Do you
know anything about this matter?”</p>

<p>“<i>To the Editor.</i>&mdash;Who the dickens is Albert A. Lowenthal, M.D.? Note the circular
enclosed. I have blue circled the remarks he evidently thinks will attract.”</p></div>

<p>In May, 1919, Chicago physicians received a form letter, signed, and on the
stationery of, Albert A. Lowenthal, notifying them that Dr. Lowenthal was
about to “give a Post Graduate Course of Lectures and Clinics on nervous and
mental diseases” in the “Banquet Hall, Morrison Hotel.” Enclosed was a
“Programme and Reservation Card” and a self-addressed envelop for physicians
to notify Dr. Lowenthal that they would be present. In addition to
showing physicians “how to make diagnoses accurately,” Dr. Lowenthal offered
to “explain fully how to scientifically check the Christian Scientists and
increase your earning power!” And all for nothing!</p>

<p>At later dates similar letters were received by physicians in other cities,
on the stationery of the “American Organotherapy Company, Room 902, 31
North State St., Chicago.” Dr. Lowenthal, whose Chicago office is Room 901,
31 North State St., is, apparently, president, treasurer and practical owner of
this company. Enclosed with each of these letters&mdash;which offered the same
<span class="pagenum" title="528"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"></a></span>inducements, free&mdash;was an envelop addressed to Albert A. Lowenthal in care
of the hotel at which Dr. Lowenthal would stay while in that city. There was
also a “Programme and Reservation Card” as in the case of the letters sent to
Chicago physicians.</p>

<p>According to our records, Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal was born in Chicago in
1874 and was graduated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Chicago,
in 1895, receiving his license the same year.</p>

<p>In a leaflet issued some time ago by Albert A. Lowenthal, M.D., “for the
sole purpose of enlightening Prospective Patients in regard to the therapeutic
value of the Organo Therapy Treatment for Nervous Diseases,” we learn that
Dr. Lowenthal is, or was:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Professor Nervous and Mental Diseases, Chicago Hospital College of Medicine.”<br />

“Formerly Professor Nervous and Mental Diseases, Dearborn Medical College, Jenner
Medical College.”<br />

“Adjunct Professor on Neurology and Psychiatry, University of Illinois College of
Medicine.”<br />

“Formerly Physician Illinois Eastern Hospital for the Insane.”<br />

“Formerly Supt., Riverview Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Kankakee, Ill.”<br />

“Formerly on Advisory and Associated Attending Staff Cook County Hospital.”</p></div>

<p>In Polk’s Medical Directory for 1904, Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal’s name
appeared, under Chicago, at 910–912 Chicago Opera House Building. He was
described as “Superintendent of Lowenthal’s Sanitarium.” In the same issue
of the directory, there was a display advertisement of the Lowenthal Sanitarium,
which, while located at Kankakee, Ill., had its “main offices” at 912
Chicago Opera House Bldg., Chicago. The advertisement was headed “GOAT
LYMPH TREATMENT,” and read in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Goat Lymph has revolutionized medicine, and has been adopted by the scientific medical
world as the only therapeutical agent that will absolutely bring about positive results in
chronic conditions, such as Neurasthenia, Nervous Collapse, Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxia,
Brain Fag, Oncoming Insanity, Chronic Stomach Disorders, in fact such diseases needing
cell stimulation.”</p></div>

<p>It mentioned further that Dr. Albert Lowenthal “introduced Goat Lymph
to the medical world as a curative agent.”</p>

<p>A few years ago a Chicago concern, known as the “American Animal
Therapy Co.,” put out such products as “Lymphoid Compound (Lowenthal),”
“Ova Mammoid (Lowenthal),” “Prostoid (Lowenthal),” etc. The American
Animal Therapy Co. had for its manager James M. Rainey. Rainey also operated
the “Rainey Medicine Co.,” a mail-order “patent medicine” concern that
sold “Vitaline,” a “general debility cure.” The Rainey “Vitaline” quackery
was exposed in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Oct. 1, 1910, and the matter appears in “Nostrums
and Quackery.”</p>

<p>When the American Animal Therapy Company was operating from 84
Adams St., Chicago, it claimed to have a hospital and laboratory at Kankakee.
At the same time letters were being sent out on the stationery of “The Lymph
Hospital,” signed Albert A. Lowenthal, M.D. Although this “hospital” was
at Kankakee, Ill., the address on the stationery was 84 Adams St., Chicago,
and its telephone number was that of the American Animal Therapy Company.
According to the stationery, the “Medical Department” of the Lymph Hospital
was “under the personal direction of Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal, who introduced
the Lymph Compound and Lymphoid Compound to the Scientific Medical
World as a curative agent in Chronic Nervous conditions.” A layman received
a letter from the “Lymph Hospital” urging him to take “Lymphoid Compound.”
<span class="pagenum" title="529"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a></span>Later he received a “follow-up” letter, from which the following extracts are
made. Capitals used as in the original:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/529.jpg" width="375" height="640" alt="" />
<div>Some letterheads (greatly reduced) of concerns in which Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal has
been interested.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do you know that the doctors of this country are using the <span class="smcap">Lymphoid Compound
Exclusively</span> in all cases, where the nervous system is greatly involved, with the most
<span class="smcap">Marvelous Results</span>. <span class="smcap">Isn’t that Sufficient Proof</span> as to the merit of the remedy?”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Nobody can tell you there is something just as good, because <span class="lowercase smcap">THERE IS NOTHING
JUST AS GOOD AS THE LYMPH</span>&mdash;in fact <span class="lowercase smcap">IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE DEPENDED UPON</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. Our Dr. Lowenthal gives his personal attention to all cases at the Hospital and
devotes a portion of his time advising by mail those persons under treatment who are unable
to come to the Hospital. He is a man of <span class="lowercase smcap">WORLD WIDE REPUTATION IN TREATING NERVOUS
DISEASES&mdash;HIS ADVICE ON CASES LIKE YOURS IS WORTH EVERYTHING TO YOU</span>.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="530"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"></a></span>
<p>“Think this over and if you do, you will write an order today for the Lymphoid Compound.
The home treatment costs $9.50 for thirty three days&mdash;think of that. You have our
physician’s advice and care free of charge&mdash;could anybody ofter more to you?”</p></div>

<p>In 1908 Dr. Lowenthal appeared as a witness for Edward R. Hibbard, who
was being prosecuted by the federal authorities. Hibbard operated a “men’s
specialist” office in Chicago; it had two entrances and a different name for
each entrance&mdash;the “Boston Medical Institute” and the “Bellevue Medical
Institute.” Hibbard was found guilty of fraud in the operation of this concern
and was fined $1,500. The transcript of the testimony in the Hibbard case
records that Dr. Albert A. Lowenthal, when on the stand, claimed to “have
treated as many nerve patients as any nerve specialist in Chicago.” He further
declared, according to the transcript, that physicians who make a specialty
of nervous diseases “mature in about ten years” and that after that time most
of them become nervous wrecks or insane. This was in 1908. In this connection
it is worth noting that in letters sent out by Lowenthal in May, 1919, he
claimed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the past twenty-five years I have limited my work to neurological and psychological
cases<span class="ell">...</span>.”</p></div>

<p>In 1908 also, Dr. Lowenthal was sending out letters to Illinois physicians
in his capacity as secretary of the “Physicians’ League of Illinois.” The
“league” issued a “report on candidates for governor and members of legislature,”
giving the names of the various political candidates for office whom
“the members of the league can safely support.” There were no “membership”
fees and a physician who wrote asking “who foots the bills” received no reply.</p>

<p>In 1915 Albert A. Lowenthal, whose “valuable discoveries in the domains
of Organo Therapy, Neurology and Pediatrics, have given him an international
reputation as a Neurologist, Alienist and Climatological Expert of high standing,”
was “Medical Superintendent” of the “National Sanitarium Information
Bureau.” This purported to represent the “Leading Sanitariums and Health
Resorts in the U.&nbsp;S.” The “Bureau” expected to make its “profit from the 10
per cent. honorarium received on every referred patient.” The “Business Manager”
of this concern was one Hubert Miller, M.D. The following advertisement
appeared in the classified department of the <i>St. Louis Post Dispatch</i> in
1915:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/530.jpg" width="410" height="196" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A layman who wrote in answer to this advertisement received a letter from
Dr. Lowenthal in which he said that it was his intention to take about thirty
patients south with him for four months&mdash;cost of trip $500, which includes
medical treatment, board, etc. Dr. Lowenthal stated further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have treated probably more cases of Locomotor Ataxia and Paralysis than any Physician
in United States and can honestly state that with Organo Therapy Treatment your walk
can be improved and pains controlled.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="531"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a></span></p>
<p>In March, 1919, Dr. Lowenthal paid a visit to Spokane, Wash., and Portland,
Ore. A Portland paper heralded his coming and printed a picture of
“Dr. A.&nbsp;A. Lowenthal, World famous alienist.” The paper described Dr.
Lowenthal as “the alienist consulted in the Harry Thaw case” and the one
“who treated John Alexander Dowie of Zion City fame and Pope Leo XIII.”
The fulsome puffery that Dr. Lowenthal got while in Spokane drew criticism
from one or two members of the local medical profession, who wrote to the
newspapers protesting. One of the physicians who thus wrote declared that
Lowenthal’s “coming was announced in a circular sent through the Owl Drug
Company which is agent for the sale of products of an organo-therapy company.”</p>

<p>Apparently, it was after Dr. Lowenthal’s return from the Pacific Coast that
he commenced to announce his “Post-Graduate Course of Lectures and Clinics”
to the physicians of Chicago, Denver, St. Louis, Columbus, etc.&mdash;and, incidentally,
to bring to the attention of the medical world the alleged virtues of
the products of the American Organo-Therapy Company.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., July 3, 1920.</i>)</p>



<hr class="r16" />
<h3>MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<h4>From “Division of Fees” to “Down with Autocracy”</h4>


<p>The “Medical Society of the United States” has for its “Honorary President”
one A.&nbsp;H. Ohmann-Dumesnil, A.M., M.D., M.E., Sc.D., Ph.D., and for
its “Secretary and Treasurer” one Emory Lanphear, M.D., C.M., Ph.D., LL.D.
As originally planned, the “society” seems to have been based on the idea of
organizing the “fee-splitters.” In May, 1916, the birth of the organization was
announced to the medical profession through a letter signed Emory Lanphear,
written on the stationery of the “Medical Society of the United States.” Even
in its embryonic state the society had A.&nbsp;H. Ohmann-Dumesnil, A.M., M.D.,
M.E., for its president, and Emory Lanphear, M.D., Ph.D., LL.D., as its treasurer.
The letter read in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We&mdash;the majority of the medical profession&mdash;who believe in division of fees (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, that
the surgeon should not ‘hog’ the whole of a patient’s money and leave nothing for the family
doctor), are no longer welcome in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. We are therefore organizing the Medical
Society of the United States, which will not be conducted for the benefit of a few selfish
egotists. We would like to have you with us.</p>

<p>“It costs only $1.00 to join. This covers dues for 1916, and includes expense for the
beautiful certificate of membership (suitable for framing), which you will receive on admission.
Fill enclosed blank and return to me with $1.00.”</p></div>

<p>But presumably the idea of organizing on a basis of “fee splitting” did not
make a hit, so the lure was changed. Today physicians are approached with
the plea that the “Medical Society of the United States” will make the medical
world free for democracy; it is, we are assured, a “Society of Protest
Against the Autocracy of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,” and a “Society of Medical Democracy.”</p>

<p>Membership costs “only $1.00 <span class="ell">..</span>. including the cost of a beautiful certificate
of membership.” No penalties or punishments are involved for belonging
to other societies, and:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Joining our body need not affect your membership in any other society&mdash;even the
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., if you wish to belong to it, and be ‘bossed’ by the ‘Simmons Gang’.”</p></div>

<p>The dollar for the “beautiful certificate” and membership is solicited by
means of circular letters signed “Emory Lanphear,” coming from 3447 Pine
<span class="pagenum" title="532"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532"></a></span>St., St. Louis, Mo., the address of what has been variously called the “American
Polyclinic,” the “American Hospital,” and later, the “German Hospital.”
The “Surgeon-in-Charge” of the “German Hospital” is Emory Lanphear, M.D.,
C.M., Ph.D., LL.D. When running under the name of the “American Hospital,”
Lanphear solicited operative work on a “division of fees” basis, which,
the general practitioner was told, meant that “you are to have 40 per cent. of
all fees received from your patients sent to our staff for operation or treatment.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/532.jpg" width="375" height="417" alt="" />
<div>The “Medical Society of the United States,” was originally organized on a basis of
“fee-splitting,” as is shown by the reduced facsimile of a letter sent broadcast in 1916,
announcing the birth of the new “society.” Apparently, “fee-splitting” as a rallying point
did not bring in the desired returns, so today the “Medical Society of the United States”
is alleged to be a “Society of Protest Against the Autocracy of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.”</div>
</div>

<p>With the change in name from “American Hospital,” to “German Hospital,”
Lanphear appealed for a “portion of your operative work on a basis of
pure reciprocity.” This “pure reciprocity” seems to have been a still more
liberal distribution of the patient’s money, for from a 40 per cent. basis it was
raised to an even fifty-fifty. Said Lanphear, in a letter sent out a few
months ago:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish also to inform you in spite of the despicable opposition of the hypocritical gang
in charge of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., and the no less contemptible action of the St. Louis Medical
Society, I am going to remain in St. Louis and continue to do surgical work upon a ‘division
of fee’ basis. To be more explicit, if you bring me a case for operation I shall allow you
one half of the fee for your time, trouble, responsibility and help in the management of
the case.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="533"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533"></a></span></p>
<p>Before leaving the interesting professional personality of Lanphear, and
carefully avoiding any details of a personal nature, we may remind our
readers that as long ago as 1908 Lanphear was the “Dean” of the “Hippocratean
College of Medicine,” with A.&nbsp;H. Ohmann-Dumesnil, A.M., M.D., M.E.,
Sc.D., “Vice-Dean.” At that time Lanphear sent out letters to physicians
proposing the organization of a “Post Graduate Faculty” on the following
basis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those who hold full professorships shall purchase stock in the corporation to the amount
of $1,000.00; those who become lecturers or instructors shall pay in the sum of $500.00;
those who are to be merely clinical assistants will buy ten shares of stock, $100.00.”</p></div>

<p>The “Hippocratean College” was a “sundown” affair; it never graduated
a student, and expired in 1910.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/533.jpg" width="405" height="228" alt="" />
<div>Reduced facsimile of the letter-heads of an institution known variously as the “American
Hospital” and the “German Hospital.” The change in name from “American” to “German”
seems to have taken place early in 1915&mdash;when things German were more popular and
profitable than they are today!</div>
</div>

<p>But to come back to the “Society of Medical Democracy”: The “Medical
Society of the United States” seems to have been born in 1916. Its parents,
so far as is apparent, seem to have been Lanphear and Ohmann-Dumesnil.
The latter, it may be remembered, used to be the editor and proprietor of the
<i>St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal</i>, a publication so obviously venal, that
its value to the nostrum makers, whose interests it espoused, must have been
small. Advertising pages, “original articles” and “editorials”&mdash;all were used
to puff nostrums of the crudest type. It was Ohmann-Dumesnil and his journal
that came to the defense of the “patent medicine” interests when they were
so hard hit by Mr. Adam’s “Great American Fraud” series. In commenting
on this phase of “patent medicine” activities, <i>Collier’s</i>, in January, 1907, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Headache powders came in for a considerable share of attention in the patent medicine
articles. There was much talk of libels among the headache powder makers, but they decided
upon the safer methods of hiring a meretricious medical publication, the <i>St. Louis Medical
and Surgical Journal</i>, to print an article in which the <i>Collier’s</i> statements were branded as
lies, and the <i>Collier’s</i> editors and writers as liars and libelers. This article the Proprietary
Association of America circulated in pamphlet form. The journal which printed it died a
natural death a few weeks later. Its editor, one A.&nbsp;H. Ohmann-Dumesnil, has just appeared
in the public prints in an unsavory connection with a corrupt lobbying project in St. Louis.”</p></div>

<p>Some of the nostrums that Ohmann-Dumesnil has recommended are: “San­metto,”
“Gono­san,” “Cac­tina Pillets,” “Pepto-Mangan,” “Satyria,” “Campho-Phenique,”
<span class="pagenum" title="534"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534"></a></span>“Tonga­line,” “Germi­letum,” “Narko­gen,” “Noso­phen,” “Mer­cauro,”
“Arsen­auro,” and “Hydro­zone.” Many of these testimonials were, of course,
used by the manufacturers in their advertising “literature.”</p>

<p>At the time that the Medical Society of the United States was being organized&mdash;in
1916&mdash;there was published what purported to be a preliminary program
of its first meeting. The meeting was held in St. Louis, and the program,
while containing the names of men with special fads or interests to exploit,
also contained the names of some men of standing. It appeared, however, on
investigation, that at least some of the latter had but a hazy conception of the
use to which their names were being put, and protested vigorously on learning
the facts, repudiating the organization.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/534.jpg" width="375" height="492" alt="" />
<div>Reduced facsimile of a letter sent out in 1912, soliciting the purchasing of stock in the
“American Hospital” on a division of fee basis&mdash;forty-sixty!</div>
</div>

<p>Now, in 1918, another drive is on for membership; letters signed “Emory
Lanphear” are being sent to various selected groups of physicians. For example,
the Eclectics are being coaxed by a letter which commences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We want every reputable Eclectic practitioner in this country to join our society of
protest against the iniquities of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="535"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535"></a></span></p>
<p>An identical letter has been addressed to Homeo­paths, the words “Homeo­pathic
practitioner” being substituted for “Eclectic practitioners.” In all of
the letters the “beautiful certificate of membership” is emphasized, and the
trivial cost&mdash;“only $1.00 a year”&mdash;is referred to, while the plea: “surely you
are willing to help to that amount to ‘down’ the ‘gang’ in charge of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,”
is featured. Another group of letters has gone out to the graduates
of the Barnes Medical College. This commences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Most graduates of ‘Old Barnes’ have joined our society of protest against the iniquities
of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Why should you also not come in? It costs only $1.00 to become a member,
including the cost of a beautiful certificate of membership.”</p></div>

<p>Still another group appeal is based on sex; thus Lanphear:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We want every reputable ‘lady physician’ in this country to join our society of protest
against the iniquities of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.”</p></div>

<p>And yet another:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You formerly belonged to the Tri-State Medical Society, of which I was Treasurer for
20 years. It is now dead. I wish you would join our new society which has superseded
Tri-State in this territory.”</p></div>

<p>With these various letters is enclosed a “preliminary program” of the 1918
meeting which is to be held October 8 and 9 in Chicago. As might be expected,
many of the names on the program are characteristic of the organization and
an interesting “story” might be made from the material in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>’s files
on the individuals. Such names are of men, who, professionally speaking,
range from faddists, who ride grotesque and bizarre medical hobbies, to those
who with special interests to exploit and unable to use reputable medical
organizations for that purpose, take refuge in such hybrid conglomerations as
the Medical Society of the United States. Not that the program contains the
names of crude quacks, or obvious medical swindlers. It is representative,
rather, of that twilight zone of professionalism, the penumbra, in whose uncertain
light it is difficult to distinguish between the unbalanced visionary, with
a fad, and the more sinister near-quack, with a “scheme.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 5, 1918.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE NATIONAL FORMULARY&mdash;A REVIEW OF THE
FOURTH EDITION</h3>


<p>The fourth edition of the National Formulary appears simultaneously with
the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia IX, and is to become official at the same time (September
1). The principles which determine its scope, as frankly set forth in
the preface, are apparently the same as those applied, though more faint-heartedly,
in the compilation of the Pharmacopeia. A statement in the preface
of the new National Formulary runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The scope of the present National Formulary is the same as in previous issues, and is
based on medical usage rather than on therapeutic ideals. The committee consists entirely
of pharmacists, or of men with a pharmaceutical training, and it cannot presume either to
judge therapeutic practice or to follow any particular school of therapeutic practice. The
question of the addition or deletion of any formula was judged on the basis of its use by
physicians and its pharmaceutical soundness. The considerable use by physicians of any
preparation was considered sufficient warrant for the inclusion of its formula in the book,
and a negligible or diminishing use as justifying its exclusion.”</p></div>

<p>Part I of the volume contains formulas, good, bad and indifferent, including
the equivalents of a large number of shotgun proprietaries. Part II
contains descriptions of drugs. This is a new feature. The purpose is to
<span class="pagenum" title="536"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a></span>provide standards for those drugs not described in the Pharmacopeia but used
in N.&nbsp;F. preparations. Many of these drugs were described in the U.&nbsp;S.
Pharmacopeia VIII, but have not been included in the ninth revision. Practically
all are either worthless or superfluous. Part III contains descriptions
of special tests and reagents.</p>

<p>Among the thera­peutically useful formulas are those for aromatic castor oil,
emulsion of castor oil, sprays or nebulae, solution of aluminum acetate, solution
of aluminum subacetate and wine of antimony. The two last named are
also included in “Useful Drugs.” Several formulas for new classes of
preparations which may or may not be found superior to old forms are paste
pencils for the application of medicaments to limited areas of the skin, mulls,
which are ointments spread like plasters, and fluidglycerates, which are fluidextracts
in which glycerin takes the place of alcohol. It should be noted also
that, as a result of criticism, the alcohol content of some preparations has
been reduced.</p>

<p>As a whole, the present edition of the National Formulary, like its
predecessors, is “pharmaceutically useful but not a therapeutic necessity.” To
say that it is not a therapeutic necessity is to state the matter mildly, since
most of the formulas and almost all of the drugs described have been discarded
long since by rational therapeutists. So long as there are physicians who
prescribe therapeutic monstrosities, however, the druggist should have the
aid that is furnished by this book in compounding them. From the pharmacist’s
point of view, therefore, the book is a valuable one. Physicians
who have a scientific training in the pharmacology of drugs will not want it;
others will be better off without the temptations offered by its many irrational
formulas.&mdash;(<i>Book Review in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 2, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>NONSPECIFIC PROTEIN THERAPY</h3>


<p>The treatment by nonspecific methods in a series of cases of influenzal
pneumonia has been the subject of two recent papers<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_295_313" id="FNanchor_295_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_313" class="fnanchor">295</a></span> These methods are a
development of the work of Ichikawa, Kraus, Lüdke, Jobling and Petersen, and
others on the treatment of typhoid fever and of Miller and Lusk’s work on
arthritis. In the original work in this field it was recognized that there were
certain inherent dangers in the method and that wide application would be
permissible only with the greatest caution and under careful control.</p>

<p>When vaccines and other toxic protein substances are injected intravenously
a train of reactions takes place that includes: (<i>a</i>) a primary leukopenia, followed
by a leukocytosis; (<i>b</i>) a primary lessening of the coagulability of the
blood, followed after some interval by a reduction of the coagulation time;
(<i>c</i>) a pronounced lymphagogue effect, the flow of lymph from the thoracic
duct being increased threefold; (<i>d</i>) a hyperperistalsis of the intestinal tract,
and (<i>e</i>) a marked splanchnic engorgement with a resulting lowering of the
systemic blood pressure. The alteration of the coagulability of the blood,
together with the vascular engorgement of the splanchnic area and the coincident
increase in motility of the intestinal tract that follow the therapeutic
injection, all tend to increase the possibility of intestinal hemorrhage. Protein
therapy is therefore not a safe procedure in this particular disease. That we
are able to terminate a certain number of cases of typhoid fever by crisis by
means of such injections is of very great interest from a theoretical point
of view.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="537"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a></span></p>
<p>In the treatment of arthritis, the results seem much more satisfactory. The
work of Miller and <span class="nowrap">Lusk<a name="FNanchor_296_314" id="FNanchor_296_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_314" class="fnanchor">296</a></span> has been confirmed by a number of observers,
among them Culver, Cecil, Snyder, Cowie and Calhoun; and there seems little
doubt that we may be able to give prompt relief and even permanent freedom
from symptoms in a considerable percentage of cases of acute and subacute
arthritis, especially those classed as of rheumatic origin&mdash;and this with practically
no risk to the patient.</p>

<p>As with other new therapeutic measures, there is still some uncertainty as to
the proper dosage, which is a matter of considerable importance, in order to
arrive at a just estimate of the relative advantage or danger in the treatment.
Typhoid vaccines have been extensively used because they are readily procured
and give a prompt and sharp reaction. However, they have the disadvantage of
inexactitude in the bacterial count, as well as being of varying degrees of
toxicity, the latter factor depending not only on the use of different strains
of bacteria in their preparation but on the age of the vaccine. Synder<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_297_315" id="FNanchor_297_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_315" class="fnanchor">297</a></span> as
well as other workers, is of the opinion that the primary dose should be small&mdash;from
five to ten million organisms&mdash;and that the dose of typhoid bacilli injected
should never exceed two hundred and fifty million. While a sharp reaction on
the part of the patient is apparently a desideratum, a sufficient response can
usually be elicited with a relatively small dose. There is no object in subjecting
the patient to the risk of the profound depression that follows occasionally
in the wake of large doses. Indeed, the only serious results so far
ascribed as due to this form of therapy have followed very large doses or the
use of relatively large doses in moribund patients; or such unreasonable procedures
as the intravenous injection of milk. It is true that milk injections were
recommended by some of the German investigators, but they were always
used intramuscularly.</p>

<p>In the treatment of pneumonia, Roberts and <span class="nowrap">Cary<a name="FNanchor_298_316" id="FNanchor_298_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_316" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> have employed a vaccine
made up of 100 million of each of the following organisms per cubic centimeter:
influenza bacilli, pneumococci, staphylococci and streptococci. Of this vaccine
they injected, intravenously, first 0.5&nbsp;c.c., later 1&nbsp;c.c. In the series of 200
patients so treated there was no evidence of injury to the patients in any way.
The mortality in this series was 9.5 per cent.; in a series of eighty-six patients
not treated with vaccine, the mortality was 31.2 per cent. In the untreated series,
20 per cent. recovered by crisis; in the treated, 36 per cent. so recovered. Before
any reliance is placed on such statistics they should be analyzed and compared
carefully according to age periods, as the death rate may vary at different ages.
Cowie and <span class="nowrap">Beaven<a href="#Footnote_298_316" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> used typhoid vaccine in the treatment of their patients, and
they consider the vaccine shock as indicated only in the early stages of
pneumonia.</p>

<p>Before applying the treatment to such diseases as pneumonia it would seem
that prudence would demand a thorough familiarity with the range of the reaction
and the degree of toxicity of the preparation it is intended to use by first
employing it in some arthritic cases. In pneumonia we must ever keep before
us the vital factor of cardiac impairment; and certainly we must not undertake
any measure that may depress the function of the heart. In arthritis this danger
is largely a negligible one; and, with proper precaution, nonspecific therapy is
not only without risk but indeed frequently followed by gratifying clinical
improvement. Only in the light of experience gained in the manner indicated
would it seem permissible for us to attempt to extend this form of therapy to
more acute infections.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 17, 1919</i>.)</p>

<h3>WILLARD EALON OGDEN</h3>

<h4>A “Specialist in Proctology” and His “Clinics”</h4>


<p>Within the past few weeks a number of inquiries have reached <i>The Journal</i>
from physicians in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Those that follow are
typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am in receipt of literature from H.&nbsp;L. Roberts, 1126 Masonic Temple, Chicago,
advertising clinic in Cleveland by Dr. Willard E. Ogden who claims to be a member of the
Chicago Medical Society and the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. What can you say of this man and his methods?”</p>

<p>“I am enclosing a folder received a short time ago. I would be glad to know if Dr.
Ogden is a member of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. as he claims to be.”</p>

<p>“The enclosed folder has been sent to many doctors in Indiana. The purpose is plain.
The attached post card on this one was returned to him for further literature.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/538.jpg" width="305" height="487" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction of one of Ogden advertisements in Chicago newspapers at
the time he was at 36 W. Randolph Street.</div>
</div>

<p>In each case the correspondents send in a four-page folder bearing the title
“Proctology, A Clinic. Who? Where? Why?” Three of the four pages
purport to answer the interrogations given on the title page. Under “Who?”
we read:</p>

<p class="tac fs85">
DR. WILLARD E. OGDEN<br />

Chicago, Ill.<br />

<span class="fs80 lh2em">SPECIALIST IN PROCTOLOGY</span><br />

<i>Member Chicago Medical Society and A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</i><br />
<i>Author of “Improved Method of Treating Rectal Diseases”<br />
Formerly associated with Drs. Burleson &amp; Burleson<br />
Grand Rapids, Mich.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="539"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539"></a></span></p>
<p>Under the question “Where?” there appears the statement that “Dr. Ogden
Will Hold a Clinic for The Treatment of Rectal Diseases” and the name of
the city and the dates of the “clinic” are inserted with a typewriter.</p>

<p>Under “Why?” we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Ogden does not use the usual surgical methods. His many years of experience in the
treatment of Rectal Diseases (during which time he has been associated with the leading Proctologists
of America) have enabled him to develop a system of office treatment <i>which is
not taught by any other practitioner</i>.</p>

<p>“Tear off, sign and mail attached postcard and I will send you a booklet giving you
full particulars as to the course.</p>

<p class="tac">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">H. L. Roberts</span>, Business Manager.</p>

<p>“Eighty-three per cent. of the people have some Rectal trouble. THIS IS THE DAY OF
SPECIALISTS. Why not fit yourself to specialize in Proctology?”</p></div>

<p>The fourth page is a post card addressed to “H.&nbsp;L. Roberts, Room 1126,
Masonic Temple, Chicago.” On the reverse side there is a printed statement
which the recipient is expected to sign to the effect that he is interested in “Dr.
Ogden’s Clinic” and wishes to have “full particulars of the course.”</p>

<p>A visit to Room 1126, Masonic Temple, failed to disclose the name of H.&nbsp;L.
Roberts, either on the door (or doors, for there are two rooms having this
number) or on the office building directory board. In fact, Rooms 1126 seem to
contain a somewhat miscellaneous assortment. The signs, either on the door
or on the directory board, show that there is a public stenographer (who
operates a “Mailing Service,” and does “Addressing, Mailing, Multigraphing,
Mimeographing”), a bookstore, a chocolate company, a publishing company, a
lumber company, and one or two other concerns; but the name of “H.&nbsp;L.
Roberts” does not appear. Incidentally, no “H.&nbsp;L. Roberts” is to be found listed
in the Chicago telephone directory.</p>

<p>A few yards away from Rooms 1126 and on the same floor there appears
the name, “Dr. Willard E. Ogden” on Room 1102.</p>

<p>According to our records, Willard Ealon Ogden was born in 1866. Before
taking up the study of medicine he seems to have been a preacher. In 1899 he
was graduated by the Saginaw Valley Medical College, Saginaw, Mich. He
was licensed in Michigan in 1900, in Illinois and Indiana in 1913, and in Wisconsin
in 1921. From 1900 until 1904 he practiced in Lyons, Mich.; from 1906
until 1911 he was at Ionia, Mich.</p>

<p>In 1911, he was in Grand Rapids, Mich., and was associated with Burleson
and Burleson, an advertising pile cure concern. From some of the voluminous
Burleson advertising on file, we learn that they “cure all diseases of the rectum
(except cancer);” and claim to have “the most successful method ever discovered,”
and to have cured “many desperate cases that have been given up to
die.” Furthermore, they “guarantee to cure in every case or make no charge.”</p>

<p>On Jan. 1, 1914, Ogden was sending out a card to physicians in which he
stated that he had removed from Grand Rapids, Mich., and LaPorte, Ind., to
36 W. Randolph St., Chicago, and that he would limit himself “exclusively to
the treatment of diseases of the rectum.” Later, Ogden was sending out an
advertising booklet filled with testimonials.</p>

<p>In 1914, Ogden was carrying display advertisements in Chicago papers
reading, in part, in large back-faced type: “Piles Cured Absolutely Without
Knife, Anesthetics, Pain or Loss of Time<span class="ell">...</span>. Cure Guaranteed or Money
Refunded.”</p>

<p>In March, 1918, he became a member of the Chicago Medical Society and
qualified for Fellowship in the American Medical Association, August, 1918.</p>

<p>In 1921, Ogden had a copyrighted mail-order course on the “Treatment of
Rectal Diseases by Improved Method.” This “course” consisted of thirty-eight
pages of foolscap printed on one side in imitation typewriting. The material
<span class="pagenum" title="540"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540"></a></span>abounded in typographical errors. Among the proprietary products recommended
in this “course” as “essential” to those taking it, was “Mecca Ointment.”
This nostrum, made by a Chicago concern, was declared misbranded
in 1916 because of false and fraudulent claims made knowingly, recklessly and
wantonly. The “course” was divided into ten parts, and with it, apparently,
came ten consecutively numbered sealed envelops, and the purchaser was
instructed to open these envelops, one at a time, as he completed the corresponding
part in the “course.” He would there find questions which were to
be answered and returned to Ogden. This, according to the description, was to
enable Ogden to determine whether it was necessary to “enter more into detail
upon that particular subject,” which, he stated, he would gladly do if necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/540.jpg" width="255" height="458" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (reduced) of the first page of a booklet Ogden was sending
out in the latter part of 1914.</div>
</div>

<p>Furthermore, the purchaser had the privilege of asking questions of Ogden
relative to symptoms, diagnosis and treatment for a period of six months after
the purchase of the “course.” Although, in Ogden’s opinion, “you should have
the subject well understood long before that time.”</p>

<p>The charge for this course and “services as outlined” was $200, but in order
to show his confidence in the ability of those who purchased it, Ogden was
willing to take $100 down and the other $100 paid in “five per cent. of monies
received from <span class="lowercase smcap">CURED</span> patients” until the balance was paid.</p>

<p>Reverting to the present “post-graduate course” and “clinic”: Those who
send in the postal card to “H.&nbsp;L. Roberts” receive a form-letter, signed “H.&nbsp;L.
<span class="pagenum" title="541"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541"></a></span>Roberts” in facsimile handwriting, stating that information was enclosed
“regarding <span class="lowercase smcap">THE OGDEN METHODS</span>” and stating that Dr. Ogden would be in
Indianapolis or Cleveland or Pittsburgh, as the case might be, on a certain
date and that the fee for the “clinic” would be $100. With this letter is an
eight-page pamphlet entitled “Some Facts Concerning the Ogden Method of
Treating Rectal Diseases.” The first page is headed in black-faced type:
“About References and Endorsements.” It then states that the “usual references
and endorsements are omitted from this booklet.” Further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to Dr. Willard E. Ogden: The professional and social standing of Dr. Ogden is such
that he does not need to offer any.</p>

<p>“As to ‘<span class="lowercase smcap">THE OGDEN METHOD</span>’ and its value to you in your professional work: What others
say or think has little if any weight. You are your own man. You do your own thinking.
You decide for yourself&mdash;Do you not?”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/541.jpg" width="315" height="503" alt="" />
<div>Photographic reproduction (greatly reduced) of an advertisement of the Burleson concern
with which Ogden was connected previous to 1914, and which connection he is capitalizing in
his present advertising.</div>
</div>

<p>The booklet gives an outline of the “Course of Instruction,” which is almost
identical, word for word, with the outline given in the letter advertising the
mail-order course previously referred to.</p>

<p>The booklet further states that “<span class="lowercase smcap">THE OGDEN METHOD</span> has entirely eliminated
the use of cautery, the ligature or any injections, in the treatment of hemorrhoids,”
<span class="pagenum" title="542"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a></span>but that “the use of the electric current has proved to be the very
correct method in such cases, as will be demonstrated at the clinic.” The
booklet reiterates the statement that Ogden’s association with the Burleson and
Burleson concern at Grand Rapids makes him “eminently well qualified to
instruct members of the medical profession in this important branch of the
medical science!”</p>

<p>In addition to this booklet there is a four-page advertising leaflet illustrating
and describing the “Ogden Rectal Cabinet” and also the “Ogden Rectal
Table and Stool.” There is also a little postcard&mdash;addressed, of course, to
“H.&nbsp;L. Roberts”&mdash;for the physician to fill in stating that “you may enroll me
as intending to attend Dr. Ogden’s Clinic in Proctology, to be held at&mdash;&mdash;.”
Should the recipient not fill in and mail this enrolment card he gets another
form letter calling attention to the fact that the enrolment card has not been
received and stating further that “available hotel facilities make it necessary
to limit our enrolment to twenty students.”</p>

<p>Careful search fails to disclose that Dr. Willard Ealon Ogden has ever
distinguished himself in the practice of the specialty in which he now wishes to
instruct physicians. Equally careful search fails to show that Dr. Ogden has
ever published a paper either on any proctologic subjects or on any other phase
of medicine or surgery. Neither does there seem to be any evidence for the
claim that Dr. Ogden “has been associated with the leading Proctologists of
America.”&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Feb. 4, 1922.</i>)</p>

<h3>“PATENTS”</h3>

<h4>Patent Laws and Patent Office Practice</h4>


<p>The inequity of our patent laws, or possibly it would be more correct to say,
of the interpretation of our patent laws, has been commented on many times
in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> also has had occasion to call attention to patents
that have been issued for obviously unscientific and quackish devices and
preparations. The cases of the preposterous gas-pipe fake “Oxydonor” and the
creatinin mixture for the alleged conferring of immunity against diphtheria,
pneumonia, scarlet fever, syphilis, tuberculosis, etc., are cases in point.</p>

<p>In a patent issued the early part of this year for the “discovery” of a method
of flavoring Epsom salt, the patent office has, in fatuity, piled Pelion on Ossa.
The “inventor” declares that his invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation
and a special method of treatment of the medicinal agents whereby said agent
will be rendered much more efficient in character. He further avows that the
“prime object” of his “invention” is to “disguise the normal taste and impart an
agreeable odor or smell to salts commonly employed as a cathartic.” Parenthetically
it may be said that probably not a day passes that some physician in the
United States does not do substantially the same thing when writing a prescription.
The “inventor” further claims that the object of his “invention” is to
utilize the salts as a vehicle to carry an antiseptic and anesthetic agent whereby
the salts when administered as a cathartic “will also act beneficially on the
entire digestive tract” and “whereby cramped and spasmodic conditions are at
once relieved with a resulting cure of flatulency, indigestion, sick and sour
stomach, colic and the destruction of worms, etc.”</p>

<p>Such claims are so absurd that the only excuse for commenting on them is
the effect they have on the public mind. The layman reading the specifications
of this patent would naturally conclude that an invention of great importance
had been made&mdash;of such importance as to warrant the government in rewarding
its inventor by granting him a seventeen-year monopoly on the sale of his
invention.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="543"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543"></a></span></p>
<p>The law requires that, to be patentable, inventions shall be new and useful
and shall show a higher degree of skill in their inception than is naturally to be
expected from those who are skilled in the arts to which the inventions belong.
It has been decided again and again that physicians’ prescriptions are not patentable
because it is assumed that an educated physician will utilize his knowledge
of pharmacy in devising proper compounds of medicines to meet the
indications of disease. When a physician prescribes a dose of Epsom salt to be
taken in one of the official aromatic waters, he does not produce or create a new
invention by so doing. Of course, in one sense every prescription is an invention&mdash;an
invention to meet the conditions presented by the patient&mdash;but such
inventions are not patentable, because they represent the ordinary skill of a
physician in carrying on his vocation.</p>

<p>If the patent office goes on granting patents for such “inventions” as flavored
Epsom salt, and it should be found financially profitable to secure such patents
and place the products on the market, it will only be a matter of time before
the materia medica will be so restricted that a physician will be unable to write
a prescription without infringing on somebody’s patent.</p>

<p>The splendid conception of the framers of our constitution in providing a
plan for promoting progress in science and useful arts by granting to inventors
for a limited time the exclusive use of their inventions, in exchange for the
publication of full knowledge thereof, is being debased. No branch of our
government is of greater importance to the progress of the country than the
patent office, provided that office is intelligently administered. When the patent
office is used, however, for an extention of the nostrum business, founded on
the abuse of patent and trade-mark laws, it becomes a menace to the public
health. The objects of the patent law are being defeated by the practices of the
patent office.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 23, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Our Archaic Patent Laws</h4>

<p>In this issue we publish two reports of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
which illustrate the weaknesses of the present working of the United
States patent laws. In the first report the Council presents an investigation
of a recently granted patent, and shows that the patent was issued on the mere
claims of the applicant and without the presentation of any evidence for such
claims. The second report&mdash;“Need for Patent Law Revision”&mdash;is an appeal to
the Patent Office for a more enlightened administration of the patent law, and
it presents a few illustrations of the unfair protection which has been granted
by the Patent Office. The protest of the Council appears at an opportune time.
In <span class="nowrap"><i>Science</i><a name="FNanchor_299_317" id="FNanchor_299_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_317" class="fnanchor">299</a></span> <i>the “Patent Office Society,”</i> an association of employees of the U.&nbsp;S.
Patent Office, announces that a committee has been created on request of the
National Research Council to make a study of the U.&nbsp;S. Patent Office and its
service to science and arts. It states that this committee will meet in Washington
shortly to consider the adequacy of the present Patent Office equipment
and the simplification of procedure as well as responsiveness to present national
and international requirements. The committee also hopes to coordinate, in
the interest of an improved public service, the endeavors of the various national
societies, manufacturing interests, patent bar associations and all others aiming
at genuine patent reform. Unquestionably, there is a growing conviction that
in the case of medicines the monopoly given by the patent laws, if granted at
all, should be granted with greater consideration of the public welfare. Too
often the United States Patent Law has been used to obtain an unfair monopoly
on a medicament or to abet quackery. There is no question that one of two
things is needed: either a radical change in the patent law itself or the application
of more brains in its administration.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,
Jan. 12, 1918.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="544"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"></a></span></p>

<h4>Patents Perpetuated by Trade Names</h4>

<p>The patent on <span class="nowrap">aspirin<a name="FNanchor_300_318" id="FNanchor_300_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_318" class="fnanchor">300</a></span> (acetyl­salicylic acid), controlled by the Bayer Company,
American representative of the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Company,
will expire next year (1917). <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has previously stated that the grant
of this patent was regrettable and worked injustice to American citizens. It is
unnecessary again to go into the grounds for this statement; neither in the
Farbenfabriken’s home country, Germany, nor in any other country except in the
United States, has a patent been granted for this product. Owing to their
monopoly, the manufacturers have been able to exact a much higher price for
acetyl­salicylic acid, or aspirin, in this country, than elsewhere. Naturally, the
Bayer Company, the American agents, view with disfavor the prospect of being
compelled to share this rich field with competitors. The foregoing furnishes
the answer to inquiries which have reached us from all over the country with
regard to the campaign of publicity which the Bayer Company has inaugurated in
the lay press. A presumably authentic and apparently candid exposition of the
methods used and the motives behind the aspirin advertising is furnished in
<i>Printers’ Ink</i><span class="nowrap">:<a name="FNanchor_301_319" id="FNanchor_301_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_319" class="fnanchor">301</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The manufacturers of aspirin are about to launch an extensive advertising campaign to
clinch the market as far as possible before the expiration of their patent rights next year<span class="ell">...</span>.
The purpose of the campaign is to identify the product with the trademark of the
Bayer Company and to this extent hamper competition after the expiration of the patent.”</p></div>

<p>The business of the Bayer Company, the article goes on to say, has been hurt
by the sale of worthless or even harmful imitations put on the market by irresponsible
and unauthorized persons when the present war stopped importations
from Germany.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The public knew aspirin, but did not know who made it [italics ours]<span class="ell">...</span>. When
the Bayer Company, Inc., took over the manufacture of aspirin in this country, the first
steps were taken to identify the product with the firm who made it<span class="ell">...</span>. Of course,
there are good reasons why the makers were loth to advertise the product or to exploit their
trademark. As every one knows, the advertising of a medical proposition is an extremely
ticklish subject<span class="ell">...</span>. It is easy to make a misstep. Aspirin is one of those proprietary
drugs that are extensively prescribed by physicians. If anything were done that might
possibly associate this drug with the patent medicines that are in disfavor with the profession,
the valuable influence and cooperation of thousands of doctors might be lost. It is believed
that this knotty phase of the question is being answered in the present advertising<span class="ell">...</span>.
Since nothing is mentioned about ‘medicine,’ ‘cures’ or ‘ailments,’ it is anticipated that
there will be but little objection to the copy. All that the advertising attempts to do is to
link up the name ‘Bayer’ with aspirin<span class="ell">...</span>. The nearest the copy gets to medical talk
is in this sentence in very small type at the bottom of the advertisement, ‘The trademark
“Aspirin” (Reg. U.&nbsp;S. Patent Office) is a guarantee that the monoacetic acid ester of
salicylic acid in these tablets is of the reliable Bayer manufacture.’&#8239;”</p></div>

<p>From this it appears that, not content with seventeen years of monopoly, the
aspirin people are attempting to retain a hold on the market <i>in perpetuo</i> by associating
the name of the company with the trade name “aspirin.” There can be no
better time than the present, therefore, for the medical profession to substitute,
for the nondescriptive name “aspirin,” the descriptive and correct name acetyl­salicylic
acid.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 12, 1916.</i>)</p>


<h4>Patenting Therapeutic Agents</h4>

<p>In the past, therapeutic agents and apparatus have been controlled by
patents and trademarks for profit. If there have been exceptions, they have
been rare. The Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association
contain this statement: “It is unprofessional to receive remuneration
<span class="pagenum" title="545"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a></span>from patents for surgical instruments or medicines.” This does not mean that
the patenting is wrong in itself; there are occasions when it is wise, if not
necessary, to obtain a patent in the interest of the public, and, in the case of
surgical instruments and medicines, of the medical profession. In certain
instances it is absolutely necessary that the article produced shall maintain
a definite standard of quality and purity&mdash;and, it may be added, shall be sold at
a reasonable price. Enterprising pharmaceutical manufacturers have usually
been ready to appropriate the results of scientific research by investigators or
therapeutic measures suggested by practicing physicians. Not infrequently, in
such instances, the desire for financial gain has caused the marketing of such
products with extravagant, if not false, claims as to their value. Yet the patent
laws may be used so as to protect and benefit the public and the medical profession.
In research laboratories, work is being carried on resulting in the
production of new therapeutic agents. It is important that these agents shall be
so controlled that they may be made available without subordination to commercial
interests. It has become practically necessary, therefore, for research
workers to protect their products in the interest of the public welfare and
scientific medicine. It has not been an easy matter to decide how best to bring
about the desired results. This question has been before the Board of Trustees
of the American Medical Association; and, in 1914, the House of Delegates
passed a resolution authorizing the board to accept at its discretion patents
for medical and surgical instruments and appliances; as trustees, for the benefit
of the profession and the public, provided that neither the Association nor the
patentee should receive remuneration from these patents. The Rockefeller
Institute for Medical Research has solved the problem in a similar manner. In
connection with the report of the discovery of several new arsenic compounds,

<h3>PHARMACEUTICAL BARNUMS</h3>


<p>Does the public love to be humbugged? We doubt it. That we, whether sage
or fool, <i>are</i> humbugged is undeniable. We are humbugged just to the extent that
we are ignorant. There lies one of the most powerful factors operating to the
advantage of the “patent medicine” maker and the quack. The layman’s
ignorance of the possibilities and limitations of drugs is wide and deep. Hence
the ease with which he is fooled on this subject. A seeming frankness in
advertising being the order of the day, the nostrum maker makes a pretense
of telling what is in his stuff without disclosing any facts that will tend to
<span class="pagenum" title="546"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546"></a></span>lift the veil of mystery and thus destroy his greatest asset. So the exploiter
of nostrums to the medical profession, realizing that at least a pretense must
be made of giving the composition of medicaments offered to the physician,
declares that his clay poultice has for its base “anhydrous and levigated
argillaceous mineral.” This sounds much more imposing than dry and finely
powdered clay, and satisfies by its very sonorousness. Now comes a product
exploited chiefly to members of the dental profession but also, it seems, to
physicians. Tablets, “activated tablets,” if you please! They are “an anodyne,
analgesic febrifuge sedative, exorcising [<i>sic!</i>] antineuralgic and antirheumatic
action.” And their composition? Simply “an activated, balanced combination
of the mono-acetyl-derivative of para-amidophenetol together with a
feebly basic substance in the alkaloidal state from the Thea-Sinensis.” As
clear as the Missouri River! Some day some dentist or physician is going to
investigate and find that this awe-inspiring, polysyllabic example of exuberant
verbosity means nothing more mysterious than our old friends acetphenetidin
(phenacetin) and caffein. In the meantime, the exploiters may smile softly and
murmur, “Barnum was right!”&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan.

<h3>THE PHARMACOPEIA</h3>

<h4>The Ninth Decennial Revision</h4>


<p>The ninth revision of the United States Pharmacopeia became official this
week, Sept. 1, 1916. It is more fully reviewed elsewhere<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_303_321" id="FNanchor_303_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_321" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> here we desire merely
to call attention to two points; what the book is and what it is not. It is a
book of standards for drugs; it is not a book of standard remedies. The
Committee of Revision of the Pharmacopeia included physicians and pharmacists
(retail, wholesale and manufacturing), but the pharmacists were in the majority
and in control. The majority of the representatives of the medical profession on
this committee would have preferred to see the bulk of the Pharmacopeia
reduced and its value as a work of reference enhanced by the rejection of
thera­peutically worthless drugs. The representatives of commercial interests,
on the other hand, argued that it was necessary for the Pharmacopeia to provide
standards for drugs in more or less general use, whether worthless or
otherwise. The force of this argument is somewhat impaired by the fact that
the National Formulary, which has also been made a book of legal standards,
now includes individual drugs as well as combinations; the new edition of the
Formulary, in fact, contains a large number of drugs which had been dropped
from the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia VIII. The principle of making use the sole
criterion for admission to the Pharmacopeia, however, on the whole carried the
day. It has not been strictly observed; good results from the efforts of the
medical contingent are to be observed here and there, as in the deletion of
elixir of the phosphates of iron, quinin and strychnin and of emulsion of cod
liver oil with hypo­phosphites. That these instances were not expressions of
policy on the part of the Committee on Revision, but merely deviations from
policy, may be seen by a glance at the contents of the new Pharmacopeia.
These include substances which have been shown to be inert, like the hypo­phosphites
(calcium, potassium and sodium hypo­phosphites), complex and
obsolete mixtures, like the compound syrup of sarsaparilla, and drugs which
have been tried and found wanting, like saw palmetto berries. Even substances
seldom used by the medical profession, but chiefly or altogether by
the public, like sassafras, hops and peppermint (the herb), are standardized
and made official. It seems difficult to discover any principle by which the
sphere of the Pharmacopeia may be definitely marked off from that of the
<span class="pagenum" title="547"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547"></a></span>National Formulary. There is one great advantage in specifying U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P. drugs
and preparations: Physicians who do so invoke legal standards of purity and
identity. The only way to be sure of obtaining substances of therapeutic
efficiency, however, is to exercise discrimination. The Pharmacopeia is no
guide. Being prepared mainly by pharmacists to meet the needs of pharmacists,
the Pharmacopeia of course contains much matter of little interest to physicians
and entirely foreign to scientific medicine.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 2, 1916.</i>)</p>


<h4>Review of Ninth Revision</h4>

<p>The ninth revision of the United States Pharmacopeia, which has been in
the hands of the Committee of Revision for more than six years, has just
appeared. As was to be expected, the desire of medical men on the Committee
of Revision to have therapeutic value made a requirement for admission to
the Pharmacopeia has not been fully realized; it remains a book of standards
for thera­peutically good, bad and indifferent remedies. Among the drugs of
little or no therapeutic importance or value are musk, arnica, eriodictyon,
quassia, pumpkin seed, saw palmetto berries, sarsaparilla and couch grass.
Many superfluous drugs and preparations are included. For instance, of the
nine forms of quinin described (quinin alkaloid, bisulphate, dihydrochlorid,
hydrobromid, hydrochlorid, salicylate, sulphate and tannate, and quinin and
urea hydrochlorid), at least four might well have been eliminated. Two
insoluble forms (the alkaloid and the tannate), two soluble forms (the hydrochlorid
and quinin and urea hydrochlorid), and a moderately soluble form
(the sulphate) are all that could reasonably be demanded by even the most
extreme partisans of the doctrine of “pharmaceutic necessity.” Further, the
use of quinin salicylate for its salicylic acid content and of quinin hydrobromid
for its bromid content is unscientific. The inclusion of these salts in
the Pharmacopeia is regrettable.</p>

<p>Those interested in the promotion of rational therapy will also regret the
inclusion of a number of fluidextracts of violently toxic drugs, such as aconite
and gelsemium (dose <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> minim each), belladonna root, digitalis, nux vomica
and ipecac (dose 1 minim each), and lobelia (dose 2<span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></span> minims). The more
diluted forms, the tinctures, of these drugs are preferable. The inclusion of
such fluidextracts in the Pharmacopeia is playing into the hands of certain
pharmaceutical manufacturers, who recommend the tincture be prepared from
fluidextracts&mdash;an unscientific procedure.</p>

<p>The efforts of the medical members of the committee, however, have not
been entirely fruitless. Of the articles described in the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia
VIII, 243 have been deleted; sixty-seven new articles have been added. The loss
of 167 titles may be set down as a gain. Moreover, most of the new substances
give promise of therapeutic usefulness. Thirty-six are taken over from New
and Non­official Remedies; nineteen are substances which are in the edition
of Useful Drugs now in the press. It cannot be said, however; that all of the
additions have been judiciously selected. It is an infelicitous time to add
calcium and sodium glycero­phosphate just when grave doubts of their therapeutic
efficiency are being felt. The addition of the extracts of aconite,
hydrastis and viburnum prunifolium is likewise unfortunate. All are superfluous
preparations, the first because a drug so powerful that an average dose
of the extract is only 10&nbsp;mg. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub></span> grain is better given in the form of tincture;
the second because hydrastis is a drug of uncertain value, already represented
by three preparations, and the third because viburnum prunifolium has been discarded
and discredited by the best therapeutic authorities. It must be accounted
clear gain, on the other hand, that the deletions include many inert, obsolete or
superfluous substances like bismuth citrate, kaolin cataplasm, pipsissewa, coca
<span class="pagenum" title="548"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a></span>leaves, ladyslipper, wahoo, cotton root bark, compound acetanilid powder and
compound syrup of hypo­phosphites, not to mention nine salts of iron and
thirty-eight fluidextracts of various drugs. Wines, unmedicated and medicated,
whisky and brandy are also among the articles dropped.</p>

<p>A number of new features are introduced, such as microscopic standards
for powdered drugs, standard abbreviations for titles, the use of the term “mil”
instead of “cubic centimeter,” and a chapter each on sterilization, diagnostic
reagents, biologic assays, electrolytic determination of metals and the determination
of alcohol, the melting point, the boiling point and the congealing point.</p>

<p>The chemical nomenclature is substantially the same as that adopted in the
previous revision; so is the nomenclature of drugs. The addition of official
abbreviations for the Latin titles of drugs will doubtless be found a useful
feature.</p>

<p>Less commendable is the change from the familiar “Cc.” to “mil.” The
term “cubic centimeter” is so thoroughly established and so widely used,
wherever the metric system is employed, that it cannot be expected that it will
be universally displaced by the word “mil.” The latter is therefore only a
superfluous synonym, and as such out of harmony with the simplicity of the
metric system. Perhaps it may even be taken for the abbreviation of “millimeter,”
“milligram” or other words derived from “mille,” which would be
equally entitled to the same abbreviation.&mdash;(<i>Book Review in The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 2, 1916.</i>)</p>

<h3>PHYSICIAN’S STOCK IN PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS</h3>


<p>The letter that follows comes from a physician who feels that he has a
grievance regarding a company in which he holds stock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In 1914, I bought some stock of the &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; Company, and in 1917
bought some more stock in the same company. I notice that the company
advertises in <span class="smcap">The Journal of the American Medical Association</span>, and I
believe it does this not so much to acquaint the medical profession with its
product, as to acquaint physicians with its name in order that its stock salesmen
can keep on unloading more stock to members of the medical profession.</p>

<p>“The company gets the doctors’ money through the sale of stocks, it gets
its product on the market with the doctors’ assistance and through their
influence, and it looks to me as if the doctors were getting very little in return,
as the dividend checks have been few and far between since I have known
anything of the company.</p>

<p>“It is not my idea to criticize the product; but I do believe and feel that
the stockholders are entitled to a square deal from a company which in turn
is expecting so much from them, and again I feel that the publishers of <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> should be made aware of these conditions so that they do not either
consciously or unconsciously foster a concern that is depriving the physician
of his hard-earned money.</p>

<p>“If this letter is unfair, I am willing to be shown otherwise. Kindly publish
it in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, omitting my name and address.”</p></div>

<p>The company to which our correspondent refers put out a proprietary
product prescribed by physicians and used by the public. Some years ago the
company in question advertised its product in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> until its stock-selling
scheme was brought to the attention of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>; the advertisements
were then rejected. Some years later, on evidence that the company had
discontinued its stock-selling methods to physicians, its product was again
admitted to the advertising pages of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>. Our correspondent says
that he believes that the physicians who hold stock in this company “are entitled
<span class="pagenum" title="549"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a></span>to a square deal.” What about the public? Is it getting a square deal when
physicians are financially interested in the products that they may be called on
to prescribe? Is the average layman’s confidence in the medical profession
likely to be enhanced when he learns that the physician to whom he went for
treatment has a financial interest in the therapeutic agent which was prescribed?
Our correspondent’s complaint against the company seems to be, not that the
company sold stock to physicians, but that “the dividend checks have been
few and far between,” the assumption being that had the dividends come regularly,
there would have been no complaint. It cannot be too often emphasized
that it is against public interest and scientific medicine for physicians to be
financially interested in the sale of products which they may be called on to
prescribe for the sick. It is perfectly true that there are many physicians who
would not consciously permit financial considerations to warp their judgment;
but it is not humanly possible to remain unbiased in cases of this sort. It is
conceivable that a judge on the bench might make every effort to dispense
impartial justice in a suit in which one of the parties was a firm in which he,
the judge, had financial interest. Nevertheless, it would be obviously improper
for such a judge to try a case of this kind. Yet, in this supposititious case the
only harm that could result would be of a financial nature. In the case of the
physician, the harm is not to the public’s purse but to the public’s health.&mdash;(<i>From

<hr class="r16" />
<h3>PITUITARY GLAND PREPARATIONS</h3>


<p>The importance of the standard­ization of preparations of the posterior, or
infundibular, lobe of the pituitary gland (the liquor hypophysis of the new
United States Pharmacopeia, pituitary solution, pituitary extract, etc.) is
exemplified by a recent publication of Roth<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_304_322" id="FNanchor_304_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_322" class="fnanchor">304</a></span> As is well known, the active constituent
or constituents of this gland have not been isolated, and there is no
chemical method of determining the activity and therapeutic value of various
preparations. There are, however, certain physiologic methods by which the
activity of such preparations may be determined with a considerable degree
of exactness. The last revision of the Pharmacopeia, recognizing that the best
attested field of usefulness for such preparations is in obstetrics, adopted as
a test their activity on the uterus of the guinea-pig; the details of the method
adopted by the Pharmacopeia are those described by Roth<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_305_323" id="FNanchor_305_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_323" class="fnanchor">305</a></span> Roth now reports
on the activity of seven samples of commercial infundibular extracts, the
products of five American manufacturing pharmacists. Four of these samples
were found to be of Pharmacopeia strength; the other three were much weaker.
Of the latter, one had but one tenth, another but one fifth and the third but one
fourth of the required activity. Those preparations which had been accepted
by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry for inclusion in New and Non-official
Remedies corresponded to the Pharmacopeia requirements. Roth also
compared the activity of these seven preparations on the blood pressure,
another method by which it has been proposed to standardize infundibular
extracts. The four preparations which were equally active on the uterus were
found to be equally active on the blood pressure; the other three were much
weaker. Roth points out, however, that the results of the two methods are not
necessarily parallel; in one instance, for example, two samples caused equal
rises of blood pressure, but one was twice as active as the other on the uterus.
Hence it is evident that the blood pressure test is not a satisfactory method for
determining the activity of a preparation on the uterus, and vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="550"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550"></a></span></p>
<p>The subject of pituitary standard­ization, or perhaps it may be said the
application of the present method is, however, in need of further study. Thus
the statement has recently been <span class="nowrap">made<a name="FNanchor_306_324" id="FNanchor_306_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_324" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> that commercial preparations are on
the market which have from three to five times the activity of the Pharmacopeia
standard; this was not the case, however, with the preparations
examined by Roth. It is probable that some have used for comparison a
weaker standard than that proposed by the Pharmacopeia; this, of course,
would lead to the conclusion that the commercial preparations were stronger
than the Pharmacopeia standard. Roth suggests that the employment of
standards of unequal activity by the various supply houses could easily be
eliminated by having a central laboratory distribute material for use as a
standard. It will be recalled that before the United States Public Health
Service established and began the distribution of standards for diphtheria and
tetanus antitoxins, the commercial preparations of these varied even more
in activity than do those of the pituitary extracts at present.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of this subject; this is
sufficiently evident to those who have followed the recent clinical literature on
the use of pituitary extracts in obstetrics. These preparations are used in
times of emergency; a weak preparation is valueless, whereas overdosage,
either from too strong a preparation or from too free use of a preparation of
the official strength, is often followed by disaster to the mother or child or
both. Roth cites a number of cases of ruptured uterus and other injuries
resulting from their use.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 5, 1917.</i>)</p>

<h3>PROPRIETORSHIP IN MEDICINE</h3>


<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am enclosing a reprint of my article on the “Present
Status of Pituitary Extract in Labor,” which appeared in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, June
2, 1917, p.&nbsp;1601, and also the September issue of Parke, Davis and Company’s
<i>Therapeutic Notes</i>, on page 89 of which they quote this article, that you may
compare the two. The <i>Therapeutic Notes</i> article is ostensibly a copy, but as
a matter of fact, it gives it only in part, which seems to me to be a gross
misrepresentation, and one which I do not think should go unnoticed.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Joseph J. Mundell, M.D.</span>, Anacostia, D.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Comment.</span>&mdash;<i>Therapeutic Notes</i> is one of the house organs of Parke, Davis
and Company. A part of each issue is usually devoted to “excerpts” from
current literature. The <i>Therapeutic Notes</i> may be judged from the manner of
“excerpting” the article of Dr. Mundell. Naturally the interest of Parke, Davis
and Company is in those sections of the article which may be expected to promote
the use of Parke, Davis and Company’s proprietary preparation of
pituitary extract&mdash;pituitrin. The following passages from the article of Dr.
Mundell were not among those “excerpted” in <i>Therapeutic Notes</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Used here in properly selected cases, after due consideration by one who has good
obstetric judgment, its results are usually happy, and it is a boon to the tired mother and
her attendants.”</p>

<p>“To step beyond these narrow confines of indications is indeed entering on dangerous
territory. Especially is this true as regards the life of the baby. It is recommended in small
doses by some good authorities and is frequently used in cases of slight contraction at the
brim with sometimes very good results if the birth occurs within a few minutes, but
frequently with disastrous results to the baby if delivery is delayed. In such cases, forceps
are urgently indicated. Its use in such cases is risky beyond question. Pituitary extract
is recommended in cases of postpartum hemorrhage, but ergot is undoubtedly to be preferred.”</p>

<p>“All means should be exhausted to arrive at a definite diagnosis, and the dangers of its
use should be fully appreciated and due consideration given before its administration in any
case, for such a powerful drug, used indiscriminately, will surely produce sad results to
mother or child or both.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" title="551"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a></span>
<p>“During the past two years a number of untoward effects and consequences of severe
character have arisen. As far as the maternal accidents and complications are concerned,
I firmly believe that were the slogan of the hour “safety first” borne in mind, a number
of them could have been prevented, for beyond question this drug has been greatly abused,
as it has been given in too large doses, in cases in which its use was strongly contraindicated,
and often, I am sorry to say, for no reason other than the accoucheur’s expediency. Its
use has been reckless and careless. The many reports of its rapid and safe action have
been one of the greatest dangers. DeLee says, ‘It provides for the physician and his brother
gynecologist a lot of chronic sufferers, often incurable, even after mutilating operations.’&#8239;”</p>

<p>“An analysis of the detailed reports of all these cases of ruptured uterus with one or two
exceptions reveals the fact that pituitary extract was abused, being given to patients who
should not have had it. To my mind, to give a dose of pituitary extract to a woman who
has a contracted pelvis, mild or severe, when the head has not passed through the pelvis,
is criminal and, if the obstetrician is not aware of the contraction, he is still little short of
being a criminal.”</p></div>

<p>In the latter part of his article in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Dr. Mundell analyzes the
reports of twelve cases of rupture of the uterus, thirty-four cases of fetal
deaths, and forty-one cases of asphyxia pallida in which “resuscitation was
effected only after prolonged and vigorous efforts.” These also were not
excerpted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]&mdash;(<i>Correspondence in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 24, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>The Manufacturer’s Protest</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;The article in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, November 24, page 1818, on
proprietorship in medicine does us a gross injustice, and in reply thereto we beg
leave to submit the following:</p>

<p>For reasons which every publisher (yourself included) understands, it is
not practicable for us to reproduce in full, in the columns of <i>Therapeutic Notes</i>,
all the clinical papers to which we wish to direct the attention of our readers.
But that the article of Dr. Mundell was not garbled to make capital for
Parke, Davis &amp; Co. is quite apparent on comparison of the omitted portions
with a previous paper by the same author, reprinted in the January (1917)
issue of the <i>Notes</i>, and herewith submitted together with clippings from other
issues of the <i>Notes</i> which prove that we have not hesitated to present to our
readers the dangers incidental to the misuse of Pituitrin as well as the
advantages of its proper use.</p>

<p><i>Therapeutic Notes</i>, in quoting other journals, puts into its readers’ hands
the means of investigating the fairness of its quotations. It is a house organ&mdash;true
enough; but the organ of a house which has always appealed to the
honor as well as to the progressiveness of the medical profession. Its publishers
could not afford to resort to deception in advertising their products,
through this or any other medium.</p>

<p>The profession is indebted to Parke, Davis &amp; Co. for Pituitrin (among other
medicaments), and it is to the profession that the manufacturers look for the
ultimate verdict. The contraindications are quite as important as the indications,
and, as the excerpts submitted show, we have taken account of these,
not only in forming our own estimate, but in presenting the evidence to the
readers of <i>Therapeutic Notes</i>.</p>

<p>We cite these facts that you may give us a square deal in an early issue of
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> if so disposed.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Parke, Davis</span> &amp; Co., Detroit.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Comment</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has no desire to discuss Parke, Davis and Company’s
motives in omitting certain parts of Dr. Mundell’s paper. What <span class="smcap">The
Journal</span> did was to publish those parts of Dr. Mundell’s paper on the “Present
Status of Pituitary Extract in Labor” that Parke, Davis and Company left out
of their circular. That it is not practicable, as Parke, Davis and Company
points out, for the manufacturers of proprietary products to reproduce in full
<span class="pagenum" title="552"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a></span>all clinical papers dealing with such products is obvious. It is not so obvious
why such concerns in abstracting or quoting papers of this kind should delete
those parts that are unfavorable to the products dealt with rather than those
that are favorable. Curiously, however, whenever an author is quoted only in
part those parts are almost invariably those favorable to the product.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]&mdash;(<i>Correspondence
in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Dec. 8, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Why Proprietaries Flourish</h4>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;The following experiences seem to add one more to the
many reasons offered to explain why proprietaries and ready-made preparations
flourish at the expense of the official drugs and preparations: A few days
ago I prescribed Troches of Ammonium Chloride, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P., for a patient of
exceptional perseverance. The next day he had not yet secured the troches
and told me that he had submitted the prescription to seven pharmacies, including
the largest, and three of the best known and admittedly the best equipped
in New York. All told him that these troches were “not being made any more,”
and that they were therefore unable to supply him. He thereupon communicated
with one of the largest wholesale manufacturing pharmaceutical houses in
America and received precisely the same answer. I then took the matter up
with a first class pharmacist whom I knew and induced him to prepare this
difficult (!) troche, for which the U.&nbsp;S. Pharmacopeia gives the following
directions: “Rub the powders together until they are thoroughly mixed; then
form a mass with syrup of tolu and divide&nbsp;<span class="ell">..</span>.”</p>

<p>Seven pharmacists declined to fill a prescription for an official preparation
because they could not buy the preparation from a wholesaler, and it required
some persuasion to get the eighth to make the preparation. But even worse,
several of the pharmacists offered my patient some ready-made troche more
or less resembling the official, or offered compressed tablets of ammonium
chlorid.</p>

<p>That this is not an isolated example of what often poses as pharmacy is
shown by the fact that I have found it extremely difficult to find a pharmacist
who would ex­tem­por­aneously coat pills with gelatin. Most want the
physician to alter his prescription so that one of the ready-made gelatin
coated pills can be dispensed, if a gelatin coating is necessary. Some gelatin,
hot water, a large cork, and a few domestic sewing needles are all that is
required for very satisfactory coating of pills with gelatin, yet few pharmacists
seem willing to perform this simple procedure.</p>

<p>Two other illustrations, not so recent, have come to me from a colleague. A
few years ago he was unable to obtain from either of two pharmacists an
emulsion of cod liver oil without the hypo­phosphites because, as both said, “It
does not come without hypo­phosphites.” On another occasion four of the
best drug stores in Boston were asked for the Compound Laxative Pill, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.,
then official in the Pharmacopeia. In every case he was told that he must have
meant the compound cathartic pill, which in no way resembles the pill he
sought.</p>

<p>With this attitude on the part of the men supposed to be serving the public
and the medical profession by the practice of pharmacy, is it any wonder that
it is difficult to induce the medical profession to prescribe official preparations
or combinations of official drugs in place of ready-made commercial substitutes
largely drawn from among the proprietaries or specialties? Real pharmacy by
real pharmacists is a necessity if we are to succeed in combating the proprietary
evil.</p>

<h3>PHILIP RAHTJEN AND HIS DISCOVERIES</h3>


<p>Recent newspaper reports regarding the alleged “discovery of the Germ of
Pernicious Anemia” and the development of “an antitoxin and serum” by Dr.
Philip Rahtjen of Pasadena, California, have brought inquiries of which the
two that follow are typical. This from a physician in Indiana:</p>

<p>“Please let me know about the supposed recent discovery of Dr. Philip Rahtjen concerning
pernicious anemia. The information I have is from a newspaper clipping of October 21,
Pasadena, California. Kindly omit my name.”</p></div>

<p>A New York physician writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you could send me any information as to the enclosed I would appreciate it. The
article impresses one as absolutely inconclusive. However, I promised the patient I would
investigate the matter.”</p></div>

<p>The enclosures referred to consisted of a reprint and a letter from
“Ph. Rahtjen, M.A., Ph.D.,” Pasadena, Calif., both of which had been sent to a
layman who had written to Rahtjen. The reprint was a translation of a brief
article by Rahtjen “On the Etiology of Idiopathic Anemia,” translated from the
<i>Centralblatt für Bakteriologie Parasitenkunde und Infektions­krankheiten</i>.
Rahtjen’s letter to the layman read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your inquiry relative to my isolation and classification of the Germ of Anemia received.</p>

<p>“I herein enclose my paper published in August in the <i>Central Magazine of Bacteriology</i>.</p>

<p>“I have succeeded in immunizing goats against the Germ therein described. Five thousand
injections of the Serum have been given. Three hundred cases diagnosed as Anemia and
Chlorosis were treated under observation. Six cases of Pernicious Anemia were observed
under treatment. All responded favorably.</p>

<p>“The Serum is at your disposal from my laboratory here for the use of your physician.
The price is five dollars for twelve ampoules each containing 1 ccm., the amount of one
injection.</p>

<p>“The treatment consists of intramuscular injection every second day accompanied with
a nitrogenous free diet, preferably milk diet. Your attending physician should very easily
give them.”</p></div>

<p>Just what Rahtjen’s serum is we do not know. Nor have we been able to
find any information on the subject in any available medical literature. In
fact, a rather careful search of American medical literature for some years
past fails to reveal any article by Rahtjen on any subject.</p>

<p>Philip Rahtjen is not a physician. In the Propaganda files is a circular
issued in 1917 by the “Rahtjen Tuberculosis Sanatorium” of San Francisco,
Calif. This exploits “The Rahtjen Cure for Tuberculosis” and tells of “The
Discovery of Dr. Philip Rahtjen.” The circular states that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr Rahtjen studied in Heidelberg, Berlin, Munich, Marburg, and Rostock, Germany,
from which latter school in 1904, he graduated in chemical pathology as Doctor of Philosophy.
He became assistant professor of pathology at the Imperial Biological Station at Heligoland,
and was later appointed assistant to Dr. Piorkowsky, head of the <i>Deutsche Schutz und
Heilserum Gesellschaft</i>.”</p></div>

<p>The same circular summarizes the potentialities of “Rahtjen’s Cure for
Tuberculosis” thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The remedy seems to cure tuberculosis in all its forms with equal celerity and certainty.
The evidences indicate that it does not matter how far the disease has progressed, if there
be tissue of the attacked organ remaining sufficient to sustain life, the disease can be wholly
eradicated and the patient restored to health. This is indicated alike in tuberculosis of the
lungs, of the throat, of the bladder, of the kidneys.”</p></div>

<p>The booklet stated further that patients might be treated at one of two
places: at the offices of the sanatorium in the city of San Francisco, or at the
sanatorium itself near Glenwood. The cost of treatment at the sanatorium was
to be $1,000, which would entitle “the patient to residence and attention there
<span class="pagenum" title="554"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a></span>for four months.” According to the leaflet, “This is regarded as a period
sufficient to restore the patient to health whatever be the stage of his disease;
provided only, as we remark, that he has enough left of the infected organ to
sustain life with the T.&nbsp;B. expelled.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the end of four months the patient is sent to his home, not alone relieved of his
disease, but in a highly vigorous state of health.”</p></div>

<p>All this, as stated previously, was in 1917. And yet people are still dying of
tuberculosis!</p>

<p>In March, 1920, Rahtjen (so the newspapers have it) was offering a “New-Life
Fluid.” According to a San Francisco paper, Dr. Philip Rahtjen
“announces the discovery that by the injection of secretions from the ductless
glands the human body may be reinvigorated.” The paper described the discovery
“as a long step forward in the fight to counteract old age” and stated
that a syndicate was being formed by Rahtjen and others to “produce the
extract in such quantity that it may be available for every one.” The newspaper
article showed the learned doctor in a laboratory apron in the characteristic
pose of the newspaper “scientist” pouring something from a beaker into a
test tube&mdash;and gazing intently at the camera while doing it! This was in
March, 1920; yet people still grow old.</p>

<p>Within the last month the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i> has heralded some more
wonderful accomplishments of Rahtjen. According to this paper Rahtjen has:</p>

<p class="ml1em">1. Isolated the “germ of pernicious anemia.”</p>

<p class="ml1em">2. Found the “serum” for the cure of this disease.</p>

<p class="ml1em">3. Discovered the secret of human virility.</p>

<p class="ml1em">4. Evolved a fluid “from the glands of selected bulls and cows” which will
“restore ‘pep’ for worn-out human bodies! Give added weight, clearer eyes,
brighter minds, quicker bodies and a generally ‘firmer grip’ on oneself!”</p>

<p>This “amazing discovery” was, according to the Los Angeles paper, the
culmination of “five years of continuous study” and had only just been revealed
by Rahtjen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Rahtjen has for years been working silently in a bio-chemical laboratory in Pasadena,
surrounded by microscopes, scales, test-tubes, acids, alkalis, reagents and all the accompanying
stage settings that spell bio-chemical science.”</p></div>

<p>All of these wonders might still have been a closed book to the public had
not “friends” of Dr. Rahtjen brought the matter to the attention of the
<i>Examiner</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Rahtjen yesterday, with the usual reserve of the ethical scientist, was disinclined to
talk of his work until publication of it in a scientific journal.”</p></div>

<p>Fortunately for a palpitating public, the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i> “was able to
learn the essence of his study” and pass the information on. It seems from this
newspaper report that Rahtjen first made his extracts from the glands of goats
and sheep but these extracts “were found to be too strong.” As a result “Dr.
Rahtjen is now using the glands of specially selected Mexican bulls and cows.”
The male patients who are “weak, uninterested in life, unable to concentrate in
thought” are given the extract of bull; the female patients who are in a
similarly deplorable condition receive an “injection of the cow gland extract.”</p>

<p>We have not yet learned whether the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i> has deprecated
Dr. Rahtjen’s use of Mexican bovines. Remembering the attitude of the Hearst
papers toward all things Mexican, one may look for the suggestion that Mr.
Rahtjen use 100 per cent. American bull.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov.

<h3>SODIUM CACODYLATE IN SYPHILIS</h3>


<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I was much interested in the study of this subject by Dr.
H.&nbsp;N. Cole (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Dec. 30, 1916, p.&nbsp;2012.)</p>

<p>In 1913 I treated a series of cases of syphilis with sodium cacodylate; but,
not getting the desired results, I discontinued its use. In 1915, I became interested
again because of the writings of Dr. J.&nbsp;B. Murphy, and applied it in
three cases in which the patients had initial lesions:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 1.&mdash;J.&nbsp;M., man aged 21, single, shoeworker, came to me with an initial
lesion of the penis to the right of the frenum. I began intramuscular injections
of sodium cacodylate, 5 grains, in ampules made by Parke, Davis &amp; Co., every
day for ten days. Then I halted for ten days and repeated ten more injections.
The sore on the penis entirely disappeared about the ninth day. There was a
slight, faintly macular eruption of the forearms and abdomen, which soon disappeared.
There was no alopecia. When he returned, after the last series of
ten injections, there were mucous patches in the throat and some involvement
of the left tonsil. I put the patient on mixed treatment, which cleared his
throat. He had, at end of twenty doses of 5 grains of sodium cacodylate each,
a positive Wassermann reaction. After mercury and potassium iodid for two
months there was a positive Wassermann reaction. To date, after three salvarsan
treatments intravenously there have been two negatives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 2.&mdash;F.&nbsp;S., man, aged 28, married, machinist, had an initial lesion on
the penis. Treatment with sixty injections of 5 grains of sodium cacodylate
gave results as follows: The initial sore on the penis disappeared in ten
injections; there were severe mucous patches of the mouth; the tonsils were
badly infected. There was a positive Wassermann reaction. There were
syphilids of both arms and shins; marked papular eruption; malaise, and a
slight trace of albumin in the urine. I placed the patient on mercurials and at
last give him three salvarsan injections three weeks apart. The result was a
negative Wassermann reaction, the skin was clear and the patient felt fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 3.&mdash;D.&nbsp;C., woman, aged 21, single, seamstress, had an initial lesion on
the left side of the cervix, and a macular eruption on the face, neck and
shoulders, and also, though faint, on the forearms. Thirty injections of sodium
cacodylate of 5 grains each were given. The initial lesion disappeared in one
week. Mucous patches of the mouth appeared and persisted. The Wassermann
reaction was positive. I gave mercurials and potassium iodid for seven
months, and salvarsan once. The Wassermann reaction is now negative.</p>

<p>My conclusion after two trials of the use of sodium cacodylate in small or
large doses is that it has no effect toward curing the condition; in fact, the
throat symptoms were seemingly increased in severity by its use. It has no
effect on syphilids of the forearms and shins, and if anything makes them
worse.</p>

<p>It improves the appetite, as one would expect. It has some effect on the
kidneys, as noted in Case 2; it has some effect in healing the initial lesion, as
noted in all three of this series; why, I do not know.</p>

<p>I am entirely satisfied that it has no beneficial effect on syphilitics and
have discontinued its use entirely in my practice.</p>

<p>I am glad to have read Cole’s excellent article, as it shows me that I was
correct in my decision not to use it again, as it was worthless.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">William G. Ward</span>, M.D., Lynn, Mass.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Dr. William G. Ward’s letter (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 3, 1917,
p. 390), and the recent admirable article by Dr. Harold N. Cole (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>,
Dec. 30, 1916, p.&nbsp;2012) recall to mind Dr. J.&nbsp;B. Murphy’s clinical note on the
use of sodium cacodylate in the treatment of syphilis (<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Sept. 24,
1910, p.&nbsp;1113), and the experimental work of Cap. H.&nbsp;J. Nichols, U.&nbsp;S. Army
<span class="pagenum" title="556"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a></span>(<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Feb. 18, 1911, p.&nbsp;492). The results of Nichols’ work conclusively
proved, at least from a laboratory standpoint, that this drug was of
very little value as a spirocheticide in combating syphilis. Prior to the publication
of Dr. Murphy’s letter I had employed sodium cacodylate extensively as a
remedy in psoriasis, and I still continue to use it in selected cases of the
disease.</p>

<p>Adopting Dr. Murphy’s suggestion, I gave the agent an extensive trial in
syphilis in all stages of the disease. The results were extremely disappointing,
from both clinical and serologic points of view. More recently, during the
scarcity of salvarsan, I gave the drug a second trial, employing it in large
dosage in the hope that the previous failure had been due to the employment
of insufficient amounts. The results were not tabulated, but, judging roughly
from my experience in a score of cases, its therapeutic value as an anti­syphilitic
was nil. A few of the patients underwent a temporary improvement, probably
owing to the tonic effect of the drug, but in every instance the serologic findings
were unaffected.</p>

<h3>TABLETS: DEPENDABILITY OF DOSAGE</h3>


<p>The tablet form of administering medicines is popular among many physicians
because of its convenient availability and dosage. There is no doubt
about the convenience of tablets, but the accuracy of the dosage content is not
always to be depended on. One reason for this is that the demand for palatable
and convenient “medicaments has led manufacturers to attempt to produce in
tablet form mixtures which, from the nature of the case, are not suited to that
method of compounding.” In a series of painstaking <span class="nowrap">experiments<a name="FNanchor_307_325" id="FNanchor_307_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_325" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> on bismuth,
opium and phenol tablets, conducted a number of years ago in the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
Chemical Laboratory, it was shown that no tablets on the market then contained
the amount of phenol the label indicated, the variation being from 12.3 to
112.5 per cent. Similarly, the laboratory found that in the case of several
different brands of Aromatic Digestive Tablets<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_308_326" id="FNanchor_308_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_326" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> the amount of hydrochloric
acid present in these absurd combinations was true to label in only one half
of the specimens, notwithstanding the fact that the amounts claimed to be
present were ridiculously small; in two specimens, there was no hydrochloric
acid whatever present, while a third contained only a trace. These examples
illustrated clearly the very evident unwisdom of attempting the pharmaceutically
impossible merely for the sake of convenience or pharmaceutical “elegance.”</p>

<p>Another reason for doubting the accuracy of dosage, irrespective of the
characteristics of the drugs composing the tablets, has been the manifest lack
of care in their manufacture. In 1914, <span class="nowrap">Kebler<a name="FNanchor_309_327" id="FNanchor_309_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_327" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> reported the results of a far-reaching
investigation of tablet compounding in which he pointed out that
tablets on the market were not as uniform or accurate as was generally believed,
the variations being “unexpectedly large in numbers and amount.” During the
past year, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment <span class="nowrap">Station<a name="FNanchor_310_328" id="FNanchor_310_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_328" class="fnanchor">310</a></span> undertook the
examination of tablets&mdash;proprietary and nonproprietary&mdash;taken from the stock
of dispensing physicians. The variations found in <i>weights</i> of the tablets
were strikingly similar to those reported by Kebler.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="557"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a></span></p>

<p>The determinations of the <i>composition</i> of the tablets when compared with
that claimed for them showed wide variation&mdash;from 54 per cent. above to 70.5
per cent. below; in almost two thirds of the tablets examined, the variation
amounted to more than 10 per cent.; in three fifths of the tablets, the variation
was more than 15 per cent.; in one fourth, more than 20 per cent., and in one
twentieth, more than 50 per cent.; only in one eighth of the tablets was the
variation less than 5 per cent.</p>

<p>The Connecticut investigators substantiate once again the work previously
reported, namely, that there are a number of firms who are either incompetent
or careless. For tablets of simple composition, a variation from the declaration
of 10 per cent. should be amply sufficient to compensate for the errors of
careful manufacture. It may be added that the best tablets originate generally
from firms having competent chemical control.&mdash;(<i>From The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<h3>THERAPEUTIC EVIDENCE: ITS CRUCIAL TEST&#8239;<a name="FNanchor_S_329" id="FNanchor_S_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_329" class="fnanchor">[S]</a><a name="FNanchor_T_330" id="FNanchor_T_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_330" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></h3>

<h4>Torald Sollmann, M.D., Cleveland</h4>

<p>According to the good old truism, the last and crucial proof of the pudding
is in the eating thereof; and so, the last and crucial test of a therapeutic agent
is its consumption by a patient. There is, however, one essential difference:
When the pudding is eaten, with a sense of satisfaction, we know that it was
a good, or at least an eatable, pudding.</p>

<p>If the patient improves after taking a remedy, we do not yet know that he
improved on account of the remedy. The <i>post hoc</i> type of reasoning or logic
is not respectable; but it is all too apt to creep in unawares, unless one takes
great precautions indeed.</p>

<p>Clinical evidence needs especially to be on its guard against this pitfall,
for the conditions of disease never remain constant; nor is it possible to
foresee with certainty the direction which they are going to take. It is just
this point which makes the clinical evidence so much more difficult to interpret
than laboratory evidence, in which the conditions can be more or less
exactly controlled, and any changes foreseen. It is on this account, also, that
clinical experiments must be surrounded with extra painstaking precautions.</p>

<p>In brief, while the “proof” of a remedy is on the patient, that is not the
whole story, but merely an introduction. The real problem is to establish the
causative connection between the remedy and the events. The imperfect realization
of this has blocked therapeutic advance, has disgusted critical men to
the point of therapeutic nihilism, and has fertilized the ground for the commercial
exploitation of drugs that are of doubtful value or worse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="558"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a></span></p>
<p>This has been impressed on me particularly by my service on the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry. In the course of its work of passing on the
claims advanced for commercial remedies, this Council is forced to inquire
critically into the basis of the claims of manufacturers.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the qualitative differences in the evidence for the
various kinds of claims: The chemical data are usually presented in such a
form that it is possible to tell at a glance whether or not they are based on
demonstrated facts, which could usually be verified or refuted without special
difficulty. The deductions are usually such as can be legitimately drawn from
the data, or else they are obviously absurd. All this agrees with the relatively
exact status of chemical science.</p>

<p>In passing to data and deductions from animal experiments, a distinct
change is noticeable: Not only are the data less reliable, and less worthy of
confidence, but they are more often stated in a less straightforward manner.
The presentation of the data often shows evidence of manipulation of the
results, so as to make them most favorable to a preconceived conclusion that
would recommend the drug. This is not always intentional, but is partly due
to the less exact nature of animal experimentation, which leaves a wider play
to the arbitrary interpretation of the reporter. A certain amount of this is
unavoidable. No serious objection can be raised, provided the experimenter
presents all the essential data, and discusses fairly all of the interpretations
that would apply to them.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is usually possible to form a fairly definite estimate of the
value of experimental data.</p>

<p>When one comes to the clinical evidence, an entirely different atmosphere
obtains. When the Council demands evidence of the usefulness of a remedy,
the manufacturers generally respond with every sign of enthusiasm. They may
have ready a series of articles already published, or they instruct their agents
to bring in letters from physicians. The last method seems to meet the most
cordial response, judging from the deluge of letters and opinions that floods
the Council.</p>

<p>The quality of the published papers is a fair reflection of the deficiencies
of what is still the common type of clinical evidence. A little thought suffices
to show that the greater part cannot be taken as serious evidence at all. Some
of the data are merely impressions&mdash;usually the latest impressions of an
impressionable enthusiast&mdash;the type of man who does not consider it necessary
to present evidence for his own opinions; the type of man who does not even
realize that scientific conclusions must be based on objective phenomena.</p>

<p>Some of the papers masquerade as “clinical reports,” sometimes with a
splendid disregard for all details that could enable one to judge of their value
and bearing, sometimes with the most tedious presentation of all sorts of
routine observations that have no relation to the problem.</p>

<p>The majority of reports obtained by the agents belong to these classes,
notwithstanding the fact that they are often written for the special use of the
Council, and therefore with the realization that they are likely to be subjected
to a thorough examination, and therefore presumably representing the best
type of work of which the reporter is capable. So, at least, one would suppose.</p>

<p>It is also possible, however, that some of these reports are written merely
out of thoughtlessness, or perhaps often to get rid of an importunate agent.
This is illustrated by the following correspondence, taken literally from the
files of the Council.</p>

<p>A letter from a prominent physician “A,” endorsing a certain preparation
“D,” having been submitted to the Council, the secretary was directed to write
to Dr. A as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="559"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a></span></p>
<p><i>Dear Dr. A</i>:&mdash;The B Company of C has requested the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry to admit its preparation D to New and Non­official Remedies.
As part evidence for the value of the preparation, the company submitted
a letter from you which contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So far as my experience has thus far gone, they are certainly superior to a number of
other iodine compounds now on the market, and I should judge that they ought to take a
superior place in therapy involving the use of iodine.</p></div>

<p>The referee of the Council in charge of D writes that he was interested by
your letter and asks that I inquire: As compared with sodium or potassium
iodid, what would you say are the differences between, and real advantages
of, D and the alkaline iodids? Did you make any comparative experiments
and keep a record of them? If so, the referee would like to receive an account
of your trials. In what direction could D be expected to occupy a superior
place in iodin therapy?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hope that you can give the information asked by the referee and thus aid the Council
in arriving at a correct estimate regarding the value of D.</p></div>

<p>The following reply was received from the physician in response to the
foregoing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Professor Puckner</i>:&mdash;In reply to yours of January 19, I did not proceed far enough
in the investigation of D to draw conclusions of any particular value for the purpose of the
Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry; and I so stated in my letter to the proprietors of
that remedy.</p>

<p>Answers to the questions you put in your letter require an amount of investigation of
the remedy far beyond anything I undertook. As a matter of fact, I returned about five
sixths of the capsules sent me, because of lack of time and opportunity to carry out the
extensive clinical experiments that I plainly saw would be required to give an opinion at
all worth while. I believe you had better not consider me in the matter at all.</p></div>

<p>The report was furnished by a physician for whom I have a high personal
regard. I introduce it here, not so much in a spirit of criticism, but as a
justification of the opinion that I have formed of clinical evidence obtained
by manufacturers through their clinical adjutors.</p>

<p>When commercial firms claim to base their conclusions on clinical reports,
the profession has a right to expect that these reports should be submitted to
competent and independent review. When such reports are kept secret, it is
impossible for any one to decide what proportion of them are trustworthy,
and what proportion thoughtless, incompetent or accommodating. However,
if this were done it is quite possible that such firms would find much more
difficulty in obtaining the reports. Those who collaborate should realize frankly
that under present conditions they are collaborating, not so much in determining
the scientific value, but rather in establishing the commercial value
of the article.</p>

<p>Often the best type of clinical reports&mdash;those in which the observations are
directed to the significant events and not to mere side lines, and in which
the significant events are correctly and adequately reported&mdash;generally lack
one important essential, namely, an adequate control of the natural course of
the disease.</p>

<p>Since this cannot be controlled directly, it must be compensated indirectly.
For this purpose, there are available two methods:</p>

<p>The first is the statistical method, in which alternate patients receive or
do not receive the treatment. This method can usually only be of value when
a very large series of patients is available. Even then, its value is limited or
doubtful, because it cannot take sufficient account of the individuality of cases.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="560"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"></a></span></p>
<p>The second method consists in the attempt to distinguish unknown preparations
by their effects&mdash;the method that might be called the “comparative method”
or the “blind test.”</p>

<p>In this, the patient, or a series of patients, is given the preparation which
is to be tested, and another preparation which is inactive, and the observer
aims to distinguish the two preparations by their effects on the patient. Surely
if the drug has any actions at all it will be possible to select correctly in a
decided majority of the administrations.</p>

<p>The same principle can be applied in distinguishing the superiority of one
preparation over another. In this case, the two preparations would be given
alternately to different patients, and the observer would try to distinguish them
by their effects. Here again, if one drug is really superior or otherwise different
from another, to a practically important extent, the observer will surely
be able to make the distinction.</p>

<p>This method is really the only one that avoids the pitfalls of clinical observation;
it is the only method that makes the results purely objective, really
independent of the bias of the observer and the patient. It is the only method,
therefore, which determines whether it was really the pudding that was eaten
and not some other dessert.</p>

<p>In principle this method does not usually offer any very great difficulties.
It is, of course, necessary that the two preparations to be compared shall
resemble each other so closely or shall be flavored, etc., so that they cannot
be distinguished by their physical properties. This is usually not a very difficult
matter. The method does not jeopardize the interests of the patient, for
it is understood that no drug would be tested in this way unless there is some
reason to believe that it has a value. When the patient’s condition is such as
to demand treatment, then he would be receiving either the standard drug or
the drug which the experimenter believes may be superior to the standard.</p>


<h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

<p>The final and crucial test of a remedy is on the patient; but the test must
be framed so as to make it really crucial. Most clinical therapeutic evidence
falls far short of this. The “blind test” is urged to meet the deficiencies.&mdash;(<i>From

<h3>“VACCINES IN TOXIC CONDITIONS”</h3>

<h4>Commercialized Propaganda in the Guise of Science</h4>


<p>Under the title “Vaccines in Toxic Conditions,” what purports to be a
scientific contribution appears in the original department of the official organ
of a state medical society<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_311_331" id="FNanchor_311_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_331" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> The apparent purpose of the article is to overcome
any hesitancy on the part of practitioners to use vaccines in toxic infectious
conditions for fear that they might thereby cause harm. Such a thesis is
interesting and might be important&mdash;if true. Two outstanding facts, however,
give pause. First, the theory promulgated is contrary to the experience of
those who have studied the subject; second, the man who writes the article is
in the business of making and selling vaccines! The former fact is a matter
of fairly general knowledge among the better informed members of the
medical profession; the latter fact is nowhere made evident in the article,
which the reader might infer came from a disinterested investigator in the
realms of immunology.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="561"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a></span></p>
<p>The article purports to prove that the special investigations carried on by
its author show that there is no basis for the well-grounded fear that vaccines
might be harmful to a patient suffering from toxic infectious conditions. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From a closer study of these infective processes we find that this toxic condition is due to
the rapid multiplication of the infecting organisms with the incidental production of ferments
which the germs secrete to digest the food on which they live. These toxic ferments have a
distinct destructive tendency on tissue cells, without any marked influence in stimulating
tissue cells for antibody production. The crying need, however, in these extensive acute
infections is rapid antibody formation to neutralize these germ-produced poisons and to eliminate
the germs.</p></div>

<p>Now vaccines, we are informed, are not toxic and so stimulate the production
of antibodies. In other words, the same organism that in the body is
toxic and without marked antigenic properties becomes nontoxic and actively
antigenic when converted into a vaccine. The details of the experiments of
the “closer study” made by the author of this paper (and the manufacturer of
vaccines) which give such definite and convincing results are not published.
Possibly the article is a preliminary contribution, and future issues of the
same publication will carry further articles on the same subject. The follow-up
system is well recognized in the advertising world. At all events, this “closer
study” has convinced the author of the article that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="ell">..</span>. even in extreme toxic conditions, in acute infections, bacterial vaccines may be
employed without the least fear of doing any harm. In fact, we find that in extreme acute
infections, bacterial vaccines not only give the best clinical results, but they may also be
given in larger doses at shorter intervals with less reactions than in minor or chronic infections
and the earlier they are given the better the results.</p></div>

<p>Here again no details are given; there are no comparative results of the
careful study of a series of cases. The sum and substance of this remarkable
contribution to a scientific publication is to the effect (1) that the organism
that in the body is toxic becomes nontoxic when introduced in vaccine form;
(2) that the organism that in the body is but little antigenic becomes when
introduced in vaccine form actively antigenic, and (3) that “in extreme acute
infections” when the body is affected profoundly by the infectious agent and
its product, the oftener and the more one injects of these very materials, the
better the results!</p>

<p>And this astounding plea for the use of vaccines in conditions in which
vaccines are generally held to be contraindicated, or even injurious, is made
by one whose business is the manufacture of vaccines and selling them to the
medical profession!&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Oct. 23, 1920.</i>)</p>

<h3>VITAMINS: THEIR DISTRIBUTION</h3>


<p>Our knowledge of the accessory food factors, commonly spoken of as
vitamins, is so recent, comparatively speaking, and the exact nature of these
factors still so enveloped in mystery, that it was inevitable that the public’s
lack of knowledge on the subject should be capitalized. It is not surprising
that there are on the market a number of preparations of the “patent medicine”
type that are being sold under the claim that they are rich in vitamins&mdash;although
the exploiters of these fail to explain which, if any, of the three
accessory food factors their products contain. The renaissance of yeast as a
therapeutic agent has given an opportunity to the manufacturers of this product
of unduly stressing the fact that yeast is particularly rich in the antineuritic
vitamin (water-soluble B). Because milk and certain milk products are rich
in the fat-soluble A factor, the dairy interests would apparently have the
public believe that this particular vitamin is to be obtained only from their
<span class="pagenum" title="562"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562"></a></span>products. Thus, a journal devoted to the dairy interests recently claimed that
those who want vitamins must get them in their milk, butter, cheese and other
milk products. The truth is, the accessory food factors are so well distributed
throughout the dietary of modern man that, generally speaking, the individual
who uses ordinary judgment in selecting his food is in no danger of suffering
from a deficiency of any of these three factors. It would be well if every
physician might read the excellent monograph on the present state of knowledge
concerning accessory food factors written by a committee appointed
jointly by the Lister Institute and Medical Research Committee. In this report
the distribution of the vitamins in our common foodstuffs is thus briefly summarized:
“<span class="ell">..</span>. broadly speaking it is safe to say that the individual always
finds sufficient supply of vitamins in his food so long as that food is reasonably
varied and has received no artificial or accidental separation into parts, and so
long as no destructive influence has been applied to it.” At the end of the committee’s
report is a table (reproduced on page 562) which shows the distribution
of the three accessory factors in the commoner foodstuffs.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 13, 1921.</i>).</p>

<h4>Our Knowledge of Vitamins</h4>

<p>Commenting on the trend of medical research concerning vitamins, the
latest report of the British Medical Research Council says:</p>

<p>The present situation is a curious one, upon which posterity will probably
look back with great interest. We still have almost no knowledge of the
nature of these elusive food substances or of their mode of action, but we have
gained empiric knowledge already of the greatest practical value for the prevention
of scurvy and of other grave diseases and for the promotion of health
and beauty in the population.</p>

<p>This statement, it will be noted, emphasizes the foundation on which rests
our present use of vitamins. From time to time <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has commented
on our lack of actual knowledge of these mysterious substances, emphasizing
particularly the generally accepted fact that the taking of a well-balanced diet
results in providing the individual with such vitamins as are necessary to his
growth and nutrition. Last week appeared a brief report of a meeting of the
Chicago Medical Society devoted to this subject, and it was gratifying to have
the conservative view which <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has emphasized substantiated by
many of those who took part in the discussion. Moreover, the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>, in its leading editorial for February 11, reiterates that an abundant
supply of vitamins exists in all fresh vegetables, and that a considerable quantity
occurs in milk and meat, provided the latter substances are obtained from animals
fed on fresh foods. “A normal adult,” it says, “living on an ordinary
diet containing a reasonable proportion of fresh vegetables is, therefore, certain
of obtaining a plentiful supply of vitamins.” Of all the mass of evidence
which has accumulated relative to these substances, this fact is the point of
greatest importance. It is, however, very unfortunately, the one point which those
commercially inclined are unwilling to recognize.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 11, 1922.</i>)</p>


<h4>The Demand for Vitamins</h4>

<p>Thus the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in its current issue:</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that ordinary fresh foods are the simplest, cheapest and
richest sources of vitamins, the public apparently demands to be supplied with
vitamins in the form of medicinal products.</p>

<p>The public “demands” vitamins in pill form! Why? For the same reason
that the public, lay or medical, demands many things today that it does not
need&mdash;because the whole trend of modern advertising is toward creating
demands, rather than supplying needs. Vitamin concentrates are being
<span class="pagenum" title="564"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a></span>“demanded” by the public because shrewd and forward-looking “patent medicine”
exploiters are using all the subtle arts of modern advertising to convince
the public that it is in serious danger of vitamin starvation, and that the
only hope lies in buying these alleged concentrates to make up a hypothetical
deficiency. It seems inconceivable that a rational man would pay a tremendously
high price for certain food factors which are already present in his
ordinary diet. But he will; and advertising is the reason. Advertising campaigns
such as these of the vitamins constitute a vicious circle; an artificial
demand is created and then the manufacturer excuses his business on the
ground that he is merely supplying a demand! As our British contemporary
says, “ordinary fresh foods are the simplest, cheapest and richest sources of
vitamins.”&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., March 18, 1922.</i>)</p>

<h3>THE WILLIAM A. WEBSTER CO. AND THE
DIRECT PHARMACEUTICAL CO.</h3>


<p>The following letter from a Detroit physician was received a few days ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I have just received a letter from the Direct Pharmaceutical Co. of St.
Louis, Mo., quoting prices on drugs which are not more than one half what the leading manufacturers
are quoting on the same drugs. I have received previous literature from this company
but have not done business with them. I would be unwilling to prescribe their drugs
unless I were satisfied that they are what is claimed for them. I would be glad to receive
any information regarding this firm that may be available.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has also received some letters from physicians regarding the
William A. Webster Co. of Memphis, Tenn., relative to a letter the concern
was sending physicians in the form of a testimonial (reproduced in miniature
on this page) and alleged to be from Dr. F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;P. Butler of Columbia, S.&nbsp;C.
Typical letters on the Webster advertising follow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Is there not some way through which the dignity of the medical profession
can be protected from the circulation of such idiotic drivel as the enclosures display?</p>

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am sending you an example of the sort of “evidence” which some so-called
ethical pharmaceutical houses expect physicians to take for scientific proof. It is pathetic that
there are some in our profession who “fall for” such rot. I trust you will continue your
campaign for honest and intelligent medicine.</p></div>

<p>The “evidence” to which one of the correspondents refers and which another
characterizes as “idiotic drivel” is reproduced on the following page in miniature.
It is a testimonial for William A. Webster Company’s “Ferritonic-Woods.”</p>

<div>Reproduction (reduced) of a testimonial letter sent to physicians by William A. Webster
Company of Memphis, Tenn. Those who operate this concern also have a sales agency in St.
Louis, Mo., known as the Direct Pharmaceutical Co.</div>
</div>

<p>Our readers may wonder why we are discussing in one article the William
A. Webster Company of Memphis, Tenn., and the Direct Pharmaceutical Co. of
St. Louis. The reason is that the Direct Pharmaceutical Co. of St. Louis is
apparently merely a sales agency for the William A. Webster Company of
Memphis. It appears that orders sent in to the Direct Pharmaceutical Co. go
to Memphis to be filled.</p>

<p>The following information regarding some of the products that have in
the past been put out by the William A. Webster Company should be of interest
to the profession. In government bulletins issued by the Department of
Agriculture in October, 1913, there were reported some cases of adulteration
and misbranding on the part of the William A. Webster Co., of Memphis, Tenn.
A “Pure Concentrated Extract of Lemon” shipped by this concern was found
by the federal chemists to be colored with a coal-tar dye “whereby inferiority
was concealed,” and while purporting to be a concentrated lemon extract, “in
fact, it was not a concentrated lemon extract.” Some “Pure Concentrated
Extract of Banana” was found to have mixed with it an imitation banana flavor
and an artificial color so as to “injuriously affect its quality and strength” and
<span class="pagenum" title="565"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a></span>so that “its inferiority was concealed.” “Pure Concentrated Extract of Pineapple”
was found to have had mixed with it “an imitation extract of pineapple
artificially colored.” “Pure Concentrated Extract of Strawberry” had been
mixed with “an imitation strawberry extract artificially colored.” The same
bulletins described the case of the government against a shipment of “Syrup
Iron Iodide” made by the Webster concern in which the amount of iron iodid
was less than half that claimed on the label. In each of the cases just described,
the company pleaded guilty and was fined.</p>

<p>In a similar bulletin issued August, 1914, there were recorded several more
cases of adulteration and misbranding charged against the William A. Webster
Company. Some “Wine Coca Leaves” was held adulterated in that the
amount of alcohol present was wrongly declared on the label; it was held misbranded
in that while it contained cocain, the label failed to bear any statement
regarding the quantity of proportion of this drug. Tablets of “Acetanilid and
Sodium Bromid Compound” were found deficient in strength. “Anti-Vomit
Tablets,” “Aspirin Tablets,” “Bismuth and Calomel Tablets,” “Quinin Laxative
<span class="pagenum" title="566"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a></span>Tablets,” “Salol Tablets,” “Sodium Salicylate Tablets,” “Neuralgic Tablets,”
“Diarrhea Calomel Pills” and “Morphin Sulphate Hypodermic Tablets” were
also misbranded in that the amount of certain ingredients found in them failed
to tally with the amount declared on the label. In all of these cases also the
William A. Webster Company pleaded guilty and was fined.</p>

<p>In a government bulletin issued in June, 1917, the same company was
charged with adulterating and misbranding a quantity of Aspirin tablets
which, instead of containing 5 grains as labeled, contained only a fraction over
1 grain. In this case, too, the company pleaded guilty and was fined. The
table that follows briefly summarizes some of the cases just referred to:</p>

<hr class="r16" />
<h3>YEAST</h3>


<p>From time to time yeast has attained a transitory popularity as a therapeutic
agent. Its use in this way in practical medicine has been based essentially
on empiric considerations. Yeast is rich in nucleic acid, but this has not found
any special applications. The fatlike substances obtainable from yeast have
been recommended in certain alimentary conditions, without finding any widespread
acceptance.</p>

<p>More recently yeast has acquired interest from somewhat different angles.
In these days of food shortage and enforced conservation, it has come to be
realized that the minute yeast cells are endowed with a remarkable capacity
of synthesizing one of the most valued nutrients, namely, protein. This substance
can be built up out of the simplest forms of nitrogenous compounds by
yeasts, in contrast with the incapacity of the higher organisms to construct
protein out of anything less complex than the ready made aminoacids. It is
reported that in Europe yeast has actually been grown on a large scale in
solutions of sugar, salt and simple nitrogenous compounds for the sake of
securing the much desired proteins. The utilization of yeast protein for cattle
feeding is a current practice abroad; and the satisfactory digestibility and
availability of the same product by the human organism has repeatedly been
announced since the beginning of the war. In this country the yeast which is
produced as a by-product of the brewing industry is for the most part discarded
as waste; in the distilleries it becomes a part of the distillers’ grains
that are extensively employed as feeds in the dairy industry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="567"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567"></a></span></p>
<p>Still newer is the indication that yeast is comparatively rich in at least one
of the as yet unidentified accessory factors in nutrition now popularly spoken
of as vitamins. Hopkins of the University of Cambridge, England, first directed
attention to this unique property of yeast. It has been verified by Funk and
Macallum, and recently Osborne and Mendel have given substantial evidence
of the potency of yeast to render a diet not otherwise capable of inducing
maintenance effective in nutrition.</p>

<p>Yeast has been used, like extracts of rice polishings, to cure the experimental
polyneuritis induced in birds by a diet of polished rice. From the
experiments of Osborne and Mendel it appears that less than 2 per cent. of dried
brewers’ yeast suffices to induce small experimental animals to grow on
artificial food mixtures on which alone they fail to thrive. How the use of
yeast as an adjuvant to otherwise inadequate food mixtures exerts its beneficial
effect is not yet made clear. Satisfactory growth in these cases is promoted
by liberal eating. Anything which renders food more palatable may
stimulate one to eat more liberally of it. This can scarcely be the explanation
of the potency of the yeast as it is effective even when fed apart from the
rest of the food. It may have a favorable effect on the metabolism and thus
improve the general condition so that more food is consumed. Small quantities
of milk and extracts of many of the common plant foods, such as the cereal
grains, have been found to act in the same way. There seems to be little doubt,
therefore, that yeast also contains something comparable with the so-called
water-soluble vitamins of the diet. A specific need for yeast can scarcely be
predicated on this fact, however; for any well selected human dietary containing
the usual variety of animal and vegetable foods is not likely to be
devoid of the widely distributed water-soluble type of vitamin. We mention
this to check premature enthusiasm for a new vitamin.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The
Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 8, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Yeast and Its Uses</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Is there available information concerning the medicinal use of yeast? How
is it taken? I should like to know whether the use of it would cause any digestive disturbance,
and whether the flesh gained is normal and permanent.</p>

<p class="sig">S.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L., Bridgeport, Conn.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Yeast is one of those remedies that have undergone alternating
cycles of use and of disuse; just at present it appears again to be in its
ascendency. No doubt, the reason for these cycles has been excessive praise
and uncritical use, followed by disappointment and consequent discard.</p>

<p>Hawk and his associates (Hawk, P.&nbsp;B.; Knowles, F.&nbsp;C.; Rehfuss, M.&nbsp;E., and
Clarke, J.&nbsp;A.: The Use of Bakers’ Yeast in Diseases of the Skin and of the
Gastro-Intestinal Tract, <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Oct. 13, 1917, p.&nbsp;1243) have recently
called renewed attention to its laxative qualities. When from one-half to one
cake of yeast was given three times daily before meals, it produced regular
bowel movements in a number of patients suffering from constipation. That
this result is not due to any vital processes in the yeast is shown by the fact
that yeast killed by boiling water was employed with success. It is suggested
that such yeast might be preferred for patients troubled with flatulence. Aside
from the tendency of living yeast to produce diarrhea, and the possibility that
it may aggravate flatulence, no digestive disturbance has been charged against
it. Aaron, in his “Diseases of the Digestive Organs,” speaks favorably of its
use in atonic constipation.</p>

<p>The much debated question whether yeast may serve as a food can be
answered in the affirmative in view of such work as that of the Germans on
“Nährhefe”&mdash;yeast food (Schottelius, <i>Deutsch. med. Wchnschr.</i>, July 8, 1915,
p. 817) and Boruttau (<i>ibid.</i>, July 29, 1915, p.&nbsp;924) and of Hawk and his associates.
There is no reason to assume that weight gained under its use would
<span class="pagenum" title="568"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568"></a></span>be more readily lost than weight gained from any other food. However, in
view of its laxative action, the average individual can ingest only from 1 to
2&nbsp;gm. of nitrogen a day in this form. This obviously greatly limits its value as
a food. Owing to its high nuclein content, it is contraindicated in gout.</p>

<p>As a source of water soluble growth promoting as well as antineuritic
vitamin, yeast has become thoroughly established as the result of the recent
works of numerous investigators. However, as such common foods as milk,
rice, wheat, oats and beans also contain such vitamin, there is little likelihood
of its proving of therapeutic value on that account. In other words, yeast and
other vitamin containing foods have specific growth promoting qualities only
when the stunting is due to lack of vitamin. A minute amount of this substance
suffices to produce maximal results. More is of no use. Hess (<i>Proc.
Soc. Exper. Biol. &amp; Med.</i> <b>13</b>:145, 1916) found yeast of no value in infantile
scurvy.</p>

<p>The most important question in connection with yeast therapy is to what
extent it is endowed with “antibiotic” power, that is, to what degree it is
capable of inhibiting the growth of other organisms. That this frequently
occurs in cultures in vitro is shown by the fact that yeast contamination may
practically eradicate the growth of certain other organisms. That, on the other
hand, this is not true for all forms of bacterial life is shown by the fact that
there is definite symbiosis between yeast and lactic acid bacilli (Northrup: <i>Soc.
Tech. Bull.</i> 15, Mich. Agr. Expa. Sta., 1912).</p>

<p>That its “antiseptic power is, on the whole insignificant” has been shown by
Palier (<i>Diet. &amp; Hyg. Gaz.</i>, March, 1906), who found commercial yeasts commonly
contaminated with numerous bacteria, the most frequent being <i>Bacillus
coli-communis</i> or one of its congeners. An antagonistic action by yeast is claimed
against <i>Staphylo­coccus pyogenes</i>, and on the strength of this, Buchholtz (Ueber
Acne und eine neue erfolgreiche Behandlung derselben, <i>Berl. klin. Wchnschr.</i>,
Feb. 2, 1914, p.&nbsp;215) employed it locally in the treatment of acne and obtained
a positive but temporary effect. He believes that the effect is improved by the
combination of yeast with an equal quantity of boric acid. He employed this
as a dusting powder applied freely to the skin once daily, after the application
of a thin layer of a boric acid salve (boric acid powder from 40 to 50, glycerin
and water, of each 100) to make it stick better. In cases in which the nose
was markedly involved, he also used this as a snuff. Yeast poultices have
been employed with asserted great benefit in the treatment of wound infection
of all kinds (Kempf, E.&nbsp;J.: <i>Ind. M.&nbsp;J.</i>, September, 1904, p.&nbsp;97).</p>

<p>The use in leukorrhea was recommended by Hippocrates Abraham (<i>Mon.
Geb. Sym.</i>, 1910) and many others report favorable results from yeast in the
treatment of gonorrheal vaginitis. In various gastro-intestinal infections,
yeast has been lauded by many, among others, Thiercelin and Chevrey. It has
been given by mouth, but most especially in high rectal enemas.</p>

<p>Still more from a theoretical standpoint is the reassertion of the curative
value of the oral administration of yeast in various cutaneous disorders. Thus
Hawk and his collaborators report cure or improvement in all of seventeen
cases of acne vulgaris and eight cases of acne rosacea. They also report
seventeen cases of furunculosis, in all but one of which there was cure or
improvement from yeast treatment. They are unable to decide whether the
result is due to the laxative action, the production of leukocytosis, or to other
influences.</p>

<p>Yeast is probably best taken incorporated in food. Hawk and his associates
found that yeast may well be incorporated in wheat biscuits, and that in this
way a yeast-wheat combination of most agreeable flavor was produced: that, in
fact, the biscuits with the yeast tasted better than those without it. They
found by tests that in bread making as much as 20 per cent. of the flour might
be replaced by dry yeast, and that thereby a loaf would be produced that was
<span class="pagenum" title="569"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a></span>excellent in every way and possessed of an attractive flavor. The dry yeast
was prepared by desiccating compressed yeast at 105&nbsp;C. in a current of air,
and then milling it to produce a flour of the approximate fineness of ordinary
wheat flour. They also found that yeast may be added to meat preparations,
such as Hamburger steak, to the extent of 2.5 per cent., yielding a preparation
of very satisfactory taste.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Aug. 23, 1919.</i>)</p>

<h3>BRIEFER PARAGRAPHS</h3>
<hr class="r16" />

<h4>Laxol and Lysol&mdash;The Short and Catchy Proprietary Name</h4>

<p>A laborer went to a Brooklyn physician for treatment and was given three
prescriptions. One of the prescriptions, according to the <i>Food and Drug Bulletin</i>
of the Department of Health, City of New York, called for “Laxol,” the word
being written on a piece of blank paper without directions. The drug clerk misread
the prescription and dispensed an “original” bottle of “Lysol” which bore
the usual poison label with skull and cross bones. The man drank the entire
3 ounces of Lysol and died half an hour later. The case is now in the hands of
the District Attorney, the drug clerk being held under $10,000 bail. “Laxol,” as
our readers know, is castor oil sweetened with saccharin and flavored with
peppermint. There is no excuse for prescribing the product. The official
Aromatic Castor Oil (Ol. Ricin. Arom.) of the National Formulary would
answer every purpose served by the proprietary preparation.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., May 29, 1920.</i>)</p>


<h4>Look Up Its Rating</h4>

<p>Modern business has become so complex that it is no longer possible
for those engaged in trade to know, offhand, the financial responsibility
of their prospective customers. The commercial agency is a natural development;
it aims to supply the technical (financial) information which the
conservative business man needs but is otherwise unable to get. When
John Doe &amp; Co. contemplates entering into business arrangements with
Henry Roe &amp; Son to a degree that involves financial obligations, it looks up
Roe in the rating book of Dun or Bradstreet and probably calls for a special
commercial report on the concern. These facts are so elemental and obvious as
to be trite. The complexity of modern medicine, especially in the pharmacologic
field, has made it a physical impossibility for physicians to know the
scientific status of scores of pharmaceutical products put out under proprietary
or brand names. It was recognition of this fact that brought about the creation
by the American Medical Association of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry.
This body of experts, serving without remuneration and reporting without
fear or favor on the newcomers to the pharmaceutical world, places at the
disposal of physicians unbiased information, free alike from prejudice or prepossession.
As the commercial agency reports on the commercial probity of
individuals and firms, so the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry reports on
what might be called the scientific probity of proprietary and unofficial pharmaceutical
products. The commercial agency issues, at no small expense to its
customers, rating books; the council on Pharmacy and Chemistry issues, at a
nominal price, “New and Non­official Remedies.” The commercial agency, for
a substantial fee, will furnish reports on business concerns; the Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry will, without any expense to the profession, furnish
reports on proprietary products used for the relief or cure of human ailments.
The careful business man avails himself of the services of the commercial
agency; there are financial interests at stake. The conscientious physician will
avail himself of the services of the Council; there are, it may well be, lives at
stake.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 24, 1920.</i>)</p>


<h4>The Medical Profession and Commercial Interests</h4>

<p>Last week <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> published a letter received by a physician in
Milwaukee from a firm of lawyers representing the Farbwerke-Hoechst Company.
<span class="pagenum" title="571"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571"></a></span>In this communication the physician was threatened with suit if he
published further unfavorable reports regarding that firm’s preparation. Quoting
from the attorney’s letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Metz directs us to inform you that the publication of this article and the statements
therein were seriously damaging to the Farbwerke-Hoechst Company, and directs us to say
further to you that he and the corporation will hold you personally responsible for any repetition,
oral or written, of the same or of similar statements to the same effect.”</p></div>

<p>We were under the impression that the time had passed when a proprietary
medicine manufacturer would presume to threaten a physician for making an
honest report of his results with any therapeutic agent. Such condition did
exist once, before the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry undertook its work.
Now comes Mr. Metz to revive this relic of an historic but infamous period in
the history of American proprietary medicine manufacturing. Even Mr.
Vanderbilt regretted that he ever said “The public be d&mdash;&mdash;.” One of the
elementary principles in the practice of medicine is that the individual physician
shall let others know his results, whether good or bad, in any line of
treatment. It is by such interchange of knowledge and experience that progress
in medicine is possible. Yet Mr. Metz would interfere with the diffusion of
such knowledge and experience when it applies to proprietary medicines. His
legal threat against Dr. Sargent is “terrorism” applied to the medical profession.&mdash;(<i>Editorial
from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., June 8, 1918.</i>)</p>


<h4>Rabbit-Foot Therapy</h4>

<p>Few but ignorant darkies have any great faith in the therapeutic efficacy
of the left hind foot of a rabbit caught in the churchyard in the dark of
the moon. In the light of modern therapeutics one is tempted to believe,
however, that had some one person or firm an exclusive proprietary right
to this particular brand of rabbits’ feet, there would be many intelligent
people&mdash;and not all of them laymen&mdash;ready to swear by rabbits’ foot therapy. In
medical journals (whose advertising pages set forth the virtues of the pedal
extremities of <i>Lepus sylvaticus</i>) many solemnly scientific articles would probably
appear relating the success that the writers had had with this form of
therapy in the treatment of some distressing stubborn conditions that had
failed to respond to all previous efforts. Is it ubiquity that has saved the
homely cotton-tail from being a therapeutic hero?&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal
A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 29, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Secret Remedies and the Principles of Ethics</h4>

<p>Many hundreds, possibly thousands, of inquiries are received each year by
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span> from physicians asking for information on, or an opinion of certain
proprietary remedies. In many instances the preparations in question are
essentially secret in composition, although advertised to the profession under a
fair-seeming exterior of apparent frankness. There are on the market today&mdash;and
used by members of the American Medical Association&mdash;dozens, yes scores,
of widely advertised proprietaries that are, to all intents and purposes, secret.
The physicians who prescribe them do not know and cannot know what they
are giving their patients. On this point Section 6 of Chapter II of the Principles
of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="ell">..</span>. it is <span class="ell">..</span>. unethical to prescribe or dispense secret medicines or other secret
remedial agents, or manufacture or promote their use in any way.”</p></div>

<p>The inherent and basic reasonableness of the various requirements of the
Principles of Medical Ethics needs no exposition or defense. A large number
of proprietary remedies which at present degrade medicine would be wiped
out of existence or, at any rate, go over to the “patent medicine” class, where
<span class="pagenum" title="572"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a></span>they belong, if physicians would live up to Section 6, Chapter II, of the
Principles.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 27, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h4>“Sterling Violet Ray Generator”</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am curious to learn the value of the violet ray in the treatment of disease.
The violet ray seems to be much in evidence in Canada at the present time in various
towns. It is well advertised, not in the same way as a “patent medicine” would be, but as a
genuine form of treatment. The enclosed booklet gives a brief outline of what the agents for
the “Sterling Violet Ray Generator” claim it will do. The reason I am troubling you about
the matter is that I feel if there is anything in it as is claimed, it should be better known.
It also seems that if this treatment is not capable of doing what is claimed for it, it is a
rather serious thing for a person who may defer calling a physician.</p>

<p class="sig">J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;G.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The “Sterling Violet Ray Generator” is a small high frequency
apparatus with some vacuum and possibly other electrodes. There is a violet
color in these vacuum electrodes when they are energized. The apparatus is
not one for producing violet or ultraviolet rays in the scientific meaning of
those words. The apparatus certainly will not do the things claimed for it in
the booklet which includes the treatment of practically every ailment known
to mankind.&mdash;(<i>Correspondence in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., April 14, 1917.</i>)</p>


<h4>Strontium Salicylate Not Superior to Sodium Salicylate</h4>

<p>Sodium salicylate is a valuable drug. It is official and cheap; it is the compound
generally relied on when salicylate effects are desired. And there is no
mystery about it. With the other salicylates, mystery begins. For this reason,
such studies as that of Blankenhorn on strontium salicylate are of special value.
Blankenhorn shows that strontium salicylate possesses no advantages over sodium
salicylate, as regards either therapeutic efficacy or freedom from undesirable
by-effects. He calls attention to the fact that “the salicyl content of strontium
salicylate is about four-fifths that of sodium salicylate based on the amount
of available anion.” The question naturally arise whether this smaller salicylate
content may not contribute to the notion that strontium salicylate is less
likely to cause salicylism. The impression as to the greater freedom of this salt
from undesirable by-effects may have arisen in part also from the fact that the
more expensive preparations are more likely to be given in small doses than is
the cheaper sodium salicylate. As Blankenhorn suggests, when once such a
tradition gains currency, it will be “lugged along” from one textbook to
another, with little or no attempt at critical examination.&mdash;(<i>Editorial from
The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Jan. 29, 1916.</i>)</p>


<h4>Vaccine As a Prophylactic in Influenza</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;I am chief surgeon for a large steel industry in Canton, and desire to
do all in my power to prevent the threatened recurrence of influenza. What is the status of
the various vaccines as a preventive or prophylactic measure? Would you advise their use as
a preventive measure, to immunize the workers in the industries?</p>

<p class="sig">M.D., Canton, Ohio.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The status of vaccine therapy as a prophylactic for influenza may
be ascertained from the two articles appearing in <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, Aug. 9, 1919:
that of E.&nbsp;C. Rosenow and B.&nbsp;F. Sturdivant entitled “Studies in Influenza and
Pneumonia: Further Results of Prophylactic Inoculations,” and that of G.&nbsp;W.
McCoy, director, Hygienic Laboratory, U.&nbsp;S. Public Health Service, on “Status
of Prophylactic Vaccination Against Influenza.” In brief, the conclusion of
Rosenow and Sturdivant is: “It appears from all of the facts at hand that by
the use of a properly prepared vaccine it is possible to rob influenza of some
of its terrors.” On the other hand, McCoy states: “The general impression
gained from uncontrolled use of vaccines is that they are of value in the
<span class="pagenum" title="573"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573"></a></span>prevention of influenza; but, in every case in which vaccines have been tried
under perfectly controlled conditions, they have failed to influence in a definite
manner either the morbidity or the mortality.” To make a conservative statement:
The use of vaccine as a prophylactic in influenza is an experiment.&mdash;(<i>Query
in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Sept. 27, 1919.</i>)</p>


<h4>Vaccines for “Colds”</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To the Editor</i>:&mdash;Has there been work done of sufficient extent to be of value in justifying
use of mixed “shotgun” vaccines to abort or immunize “common colds,” that is, rhinitis,
pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, coryza, etc.?</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Charles E. Bennett</span>, M.D., Aneta, N.&nbsp;D.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;We know of no investigation which demonstrates that the use of
the commercial mixed vaccines are of value in the prevention or treatment of
“common colds” or of similar affections. The Council on Pharmacy and
Chemistry accepts for New and Non­official Remedies mixed vaccines only on
condition that their usefulness has been established by acceptable clinical
evidence; so far it has not admitted any of the “influenza” or “catarrhal”
mixed vaccines.&mdash;(<i>Correspondence in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., Nov. 10, 1917.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the Editor:&mdash;Please advise me of the latest and best vaccine for common colds.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">L. J. Smith</span>, M.D., Wilson, N. C.</p>

<p>Health Officer, City and County Health Department.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;There is no scientific evidence that common colds can be prevented
by the use of vaccines, despite the glowing recommendations of vaccine
makers and the patter of the detail man. Colds characterized by catarrhal
inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat are caused by
various organisms, including a number of the commoner cocci and the bacillus
of Pfeiffer. They are contagious, and spread rapidly from one person to
another by the transfer of the bacteria concerned, so that small epidemics of
colds are continually occurring in homes and communities. The organism
concerned in one small epidemic may be different from that in another, and it
is impossible to anticipate what organism is about to invade the household or
community. The inoculation of mixed vaccines in the hope of providing against
a number of possible invaders fails to produce immunity sufficient to prevent
the infection of mucous membranes. Where completely controlled experiments
have been made with large numbers of persons, colds have occurred
among the inoculated in as large proportion as among the uninoculated. During
the war, some evidence was obtained which indicated that preventive
inoculation of troops with a vaccine containing large numbers of pneumococci
reduced the incidence and mortality of pneumonia. In the case of superficial
infection of the nasal and pharyngeal mucous membranes with diverse etiology,
less can be expected, and practical results indicate that this skepticism based
on theoretical considerations is well founded.&mdash;(<i>Query in The Journal A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_28" id="Footnote_27_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_28"><span class="label">27</span></a> Dr. Benedict’s personal communication to a member of the Council is as follows:
</p>
<p>
“In the report of the Council upon Lactopeptine which you sent to me, I find the following
statement: ‘Careful examination failed to show the presence of either diastase or pancreatin.’
In this connection I will cite to you the following experiment carried out by
myself: A package containing a 1-ounce bottle of Lactopeptine (powder) with seal unbroken
was purchased in the open market and opened in this laboratory. The label bore the special
Number 6 2382. Two hundred milligrams of this product was dissolved in 50&nbsp;c.c. of a 0.25
per cent. solution of sodium carbonate in water. This solution was divided into two portions
of 25&nbsp;c.c. each. One of these portions was boiled at once, and after cooling was added to 1&nbsp;gm.
of moist fibrin contained in a flask. The other portion (unboiled) was also added to 1&nbsp;gm.
of moist fibrin contained in a flask. Both flasks (after addition of 5&nbsp;c.c. of toluene to
each) were stoppered and placed in an incubator at 37 degrees, and left there for twelve
hours. Examination of the two flasks at the end of this period showed that the one to which
the unboiled solution of Lactopeptine [powder] had been added contained much less solid protein
than did the other. Although this fact was obvious to the naked eye, the exact extent of
digestion in the two flasks was determined by heating both to boiling, acidifying with acetic
acid, diluting to definite volume, filtering and determining the nitrogen in the filtrate by
Kjeldahl’s method. Subtracting the trace of nitrogen contained in the filtrate of the control
flask, the results showed that 42 per cent. of the original fibrin present had been dissolved by
the unboiled Lactopeptine solution. This can be ascribed only to tryptic activity under the
conditions of this experiment. Furthermore, this is not simply a ‘trace’ of activity, but is at
least sufficiently marked to warrant a statement that this sample showed a distinct tryptic
activity. Inasmuch as I have obtained exactly similar results with two other samples of
Lactopeptine (powder) (these being the only ones I have examined), I am inclined to question
the correctness of the Council’s statement regarding the absence of trypsin from this preparation.
[As noted above, a fresh preparation was used.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]
</p>
<p>
“May I again add that I am making no statement regarding therapeutic value of preparation,
and that I have no opinion upon that matter one way or the other? My work was
undertaken solely out of interest to see whether trypsin could exist in the powder (which
gives a markedly acid solution when dissolved in water). The Elixir Lactopeptine could
theoretically show no tryptic activity, nor have I found any trace of such activity in one
sample of the Elixir examined.
</p>
<p>
“In making use of any of the contents of my letters kindly include the statement that my
work upon Lactopeptine was done without remuneration of any kind, and was done only for
the scientific interest attached to the question.”</p></div>

Phosphates” may be interesting. Every one knows that therapeutics tends to fashions, and
“Phillips’ Wheat Phosphates” appears to have had its inception as the result of the observation
that super-refined white flour contains less phosphates than the corresponding amount of wheat.
It was assumed that such flour must be deficient in an essential constituent, and the Wheat
Phosphates preparation was apparently designed to fill the want. It was exploited for the
relief of numerous conditions that were supposed, without satisfactory evidence, to result from
this deficiency. When iron, quinin and strychnin mixtures became the vogue a quarter of a
century ago, it was only natural to ride on the wave of popularity and the already widely
advertised “Wheat Phosphates” was further enhanced&mdash;commercially&mdash;by the addition of the
iron, quinin and strychnin, the amount of alkaloid added being practically negligible. Those
who are not familiar with the various phases of the phosphorus, phosphoric acid, lactophosphate,
lecithin, nuclein and glycero­phosphate propaganda are referred to a report of the Council on

chlorid passes off with the water vapors, but under any condition the amount is but a
fraction of the whole. As in Platt’s Chlorides other metallic chlorids are present, the formation
of complex mercuric compounds which is bound to have occurred, should retard or prevent
the volatilization of mercuric chlorid. That this actually occurs was confirmed by the following
experiment: When 1&nbsp;gm. mercuric chlorid was dissolved in 1 liter of water and the solution
distilled, the distillate contained a very small amount of mercury. Then the experiment was
repeated after adding sodium chlorid to the solution to simulate the conditions in Platt’s
Chlorides. In this case no mercury was found in the distillate. Even were all the mercury
in a bottle of Platt’s Chlorides volatilized in a room 10 by 12 by 9 feet, this would be equivalent
to only about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub></span> grain mercuric chlorid per cubic foot.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_198_206" id="Footnote_198_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_198_206"><span class="label">198</span></a> The method depends upon the conversion of all of the iodine compounds into iodate by
fusion with sodium hydroxide and oxidation with potassium nitrate. The melt is dissolved in
water, a little sodium bisulphite added, the solution cooled and neutralized with phosphoric
acid, using methyl orange as indicator. An excess of bromine water is added, and the mixture
boiled to expel carbon dioxid and bromine. A little sodium salicylate is added, the solution
cooled, an excess of potassium iodid added, and the liberated iodine titrated with tenth-normal
sodium thiosulphate in the usual way. One sixth of the iodine found is obtained
from the material assayed, the balance being furnished by the potassium iodide added.&mdash;<i>Jour.

<p><a name="Footnote_199_207" id="Footnote_199_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199_207"><span class="label">199</span></a> In order to determine whether the iodine which is in combination with fat is absorbed
through the skin, a few experiments were carried out. The dark-colored iodine-containing fat
(obtained from the ointment and washed free from potassium iodide by the method described
above) was rubbed thoroughly into the skin of the forearm. It was allowed to remain for
four hours, after which the limb was scoured with soap suds. Beginning at the time of the
application the urine was collected for forty-eight hours. This was evaporated to small bulk
and the residue tested for iodine by Kendall’s method. Small amounts of iodine were found.
These findings were taken to indicate that the iodine-containing fat is absorbed to some extent
by the skin. It is generally believed that potassium iodide is not absorbed by the unbroken
skin. Therefore it seems reasonable to suppose that the principal iodine effects obtainable from
iodine ointment are those due to the free iodine contained in the preparation, supplemented
to a slight extent by the iodine which is contained in the fatty ointment base.&mdash;<i>Jour. Biochem.</i>,

of the melting temperature in this way (the rate of heating was such as to give a
rise in temperature of about 1° per minute) is rendered difficult by the fact that ‘aspirin’
decomposes on heating, as evidenced in the depression of the melting temperature of the pure
substance of about 1° for every five minutes’ heating just below its melting temperature.”</p></div>

salicylic acid coloration. The small amount of acetic acid was added to the sodium salicylate
control solution (1) to stimulate an acidity approximating the acidity of the acetyl­salicylic
acid, and (2) since acetyl­salicylic acid gives by hydrolysis both acetic acid and salicylic acid,
it was thought advisable to add acetic acid to the standard. If there is any free acetic acid in
a sample of acetyl­salicylic acid containing salicylic acid (which I believe is generally the case
when salicylic acid is present) then it would modify the color given by the same amount of
salicylic acid alone. For this reason it was thought to be more comparable to have the standard
contain a slight amount of acetic acid.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
A. E. Erling according to the stationery, is “Chairman” of “Censors.” Our records fail
to show that Erling ever graduated in medicine. The Health Department of Milwaukee, however,
says that Erling, when interviewed, claimed to have “a diploma from the German Medical
College of Chicago, but refused to show or present the same.” The American Medical
Directory has this item:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>German Medical College, Chicago. Chartered Dec. 28,
1891, by Johann Malok. Fraudulent. Extinct.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A few years ago Erling was in La Crosse, Wis., and in 1908 a circular letter bearing
his name and picture was sent out, from which the following extracts are taken. Capitalization
as in the original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Friend:&mdash;Permit me to call your attention to the fact that Dr. A.&nbsp;E. Erling,
the eminent specialist, after many years of travel, practice and medical research, has
given up his extensive road practice and severed his connection with the several medical
institutes which have heretofore occupied considerable of his attention<span class="ell">...</span>. Dr.
Erling’s success in the treatment of all <span class="smcap">CHRONIC DISEASES IS truly remarkable. NERVOUSNESS,
all BLOOD DISEASES, RHEUMATISM, DISEASES PECULIAR TO WOMEN; CATARRH, DEAFNESS,
CHRONIC CONSTIPATION <span class="ell">..</span>. APPENDICITIS <span class="ell">..</span>. PILES, STOMACH TROUBLES,
PARTIAL PARALYSIS</span>, etc., give way as if by magic under his skilful method of treatment<span class="ell">...</span>.
Understand, please, that Dr. Erling <span class="lowercase smcap">DOES NOT ACCEPT A CASE FOR TREATMENT</span>
unless he can <span class="lowercase smcap">PROMISE A SPEEDY AND POSITIVELY PERMANENT CURE</span>.”</p></div>

<p>
<i>The Journal</i> also has in its files advertisements (vintage of 1915), from some Wisconsin
country newspapers; which notify the afflicted that “Drs. Erling and Karass, the expert
German Specialists,” could be seen in their offices in the “Schlegel Hotel,” the “Schlitz
Hotel,” etc., as the case might be. Whether one of these “German Specialists” was Dr.
Arnold E. Erling, <i>The Journal</i> does not know. Official medical records fail to show, at least,
that there is any other Erling in the state of Wisconsin.</p>

whereas other brands are not. Since acetyl­salicylic acid is a definite chemical compound,
there is no more likelihood of this being sophisticated than there is of quinin being adulterated.
Furthermore, the Council in accepting acetyl­salicylic acid for New and Non­official Remedies
has provided standards of purity which will insure a uniform product. The brand of one
firm&mdash;Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten Co., of Philadelphia&mdash;has been accepted by the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry for inclusion in New and Non­official Remedies, 1917.</p></div>
